#### Keywords:

1. ""first""
2. ""keys""

#### Rhetorical Devices:

1. **Contradiction**: The phrase ""I want to be looking for my keys"" might imply an implicit desire to find an obvious item (keys), but the context and surrounding conversation could indicate that water bottles or some other non-obvious items are being referred as keys. This could contradict a usual expectation setting a sarcast","Contextual Cues:
Topic: The conversation is about house activities, specifically the act of searching for keys when leaving the house.
Context: The setting is most likely informal and between friends, and it's hinted at being a casual living setting since CHANDLER (a character from a sitcom) mentions it in a matter-of-fact tone.
Common Knowledge: The statement itself provides typical and expected context for mundane house matters, specifically the act of looking for keys when leaving.

1. Emotion words: ""looking for"" hint excitement, anticipation and a sense of urgency.
2. Emotion contrasts: There doesn't seem to be an explicit contrast present, but a situation of preparation for future event (going first) is shown, where anticipation and curiosity might be faintly implied.

1. **""strange things""** - This seems to be an oxymoron where something strange is being referred to in a positive or ironic way, as comparing bizarre knowledge to strange things may imply that it's rare or unique.

2. **""boiling point of brain""** - This phrase is nonsensical and unlikely to have an actual numerical value as comparing boiling point—a temperature measure for matter—to something biological","The contextual cues for sarcasm detection in the input sentence include:

1. **Speaker's tone and use of name**: Chandler refers to 'Pheebs' as someone who knows 'strange things', suggesting an underlying assumption that the information being requested is obscure or peculiar.

2. **Question asked**: The question itself is about the boiling point of a brain, a fact that is obviously nonsensical and unrealistic. The absurdity of the question is a key cue for sarcasm.

3.","Emotional cues for sarcasm detection:
1. Emotional words: None directly indicating sarcasm in this sentence. However, the context suggests irony.
2. Emotional contrasts: The speaker, Chandler, implies that the listener (Pheebs) knows strange things but asks her about an impossible-to-know or trivial thing, 'the boiling point of brain', making a contrast between the unexpected nature of the question (which should not be known by the listener) and her knowledge about strange things.

3. **Punctuation**: Usage of punctuation marks, like exclamation points, question marks, or sarcastic quotes, etc.

1. **Topic**: The topic appears to revolve around an unexpected or dramatic event (""what happened?"").
2.","In order to detect sarcasm within the input sentence, several emotional cues can be extracted.
