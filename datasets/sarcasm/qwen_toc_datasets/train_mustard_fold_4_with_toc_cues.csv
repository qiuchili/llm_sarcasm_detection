#### Speech Marker:
- **CHANDLER**: This is a speech marker which indicates the statement is part of a dialogue (in this case, a spoken conversation) or a piece of fictional narration, enhancing the context for sarcasm detection. It suggests the use of a more casual or playful language style, which could be an indicator of sarcasm.

####","To extract the contextual cues for sarcasm detection from the input sentence, let's analyze its components step by step:

1. **Topic**: The conversation seems to be about characteristics or descriptions of a situation or a person. The focus could be on evaluating the compatibility, suitability, or nature of a relationship or condition (as indicated by the word ""problem"" at the beginning) based on various attributes or labels.

2. **Context**: The dialogue appears to be between two people discussing or suggesting possible labels","The emotional cues from the input sentence for sarcasm detection are:

1. Emotional Words: ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"" - These words have negative connotations, suggesting that the scenario presented would be unfavorable. However, in the context of sarcasm, they are used in contrast to ""perfect,"" which implies that the search for absolute perfection might lead to situations far from ideal.

2. Emotional Contrast: The contrast between ""perfect"" and ""co-dependent or self-destructive"

- ""because"" (indicates a reason transmitted through a cause and effect relationship)

Contextual Cues:

2. Common Knowledge: Similarities between individuals - This statement implies expecting a resemblance between Ross and Joey, given they share the same actor (David Schwimmer). The language ""man slash woman"" is likely meant to indicate gender confusion or surprise over this perceived likeness.
3. Common Expression: ""That's so funny","Emotional Words:  
1. ""funny""
2. ""more like""

Emotional Contrasts:  
1. ""man slash woman"" implies a mocking or ironic comparison, suggesting the speaker is not genuinely saying the person looks more like a man or a woman, but rather making a humorous comparison that subverts the speaker's own suggestion that they look like a specific character."

**Topic:**
- Magical night: Implying an event or phenomenon that feels extraordinary or special.

**Context:**
- CHANDLER's question suggests that something only happens upon a specific condition (flush of every toilet), which only begins to reveal its magical nature when the condition is met. This is somewhat of an inside joke or a scenario where something (the magical night) is typically not expected or witnessed unless a definite action or event","Emotional Cues:
1. ""magical"" connotes an unexpected and pleasantly enchanting experience, implying something extraordinary that one doesn't experience usually.
2. ""flush"" indicates a routine action, part of daily life which isn't magical or extraordinary. The use of ""every"" emphasizes the mundane nature of this act.

- ""I'm sorry""

#### Rhetorical Devices:
- 'Didn't know' somewhat contradicts the purpose of saying 'I'm sorry' because one might not typically consider apologizing as a part of the reaction when 'not knowing'.
- 'I'm sorry' can be a ironic or sarcastic way of expressing sympathy which might be out of place in a genuine emotional display.","Cues for Sarcasm Detection:
1. **Context**: The conversation likely involves two characters, referred to as ""CHANDLER"" and ""Carol"". They share a personal relationship, indicating they are likely friends, acquaintances, or former spouses given the mention of ""divorce.""

2. **Topic**: The main topic of the sentence is divorce, which is typically a serious and emotional subject. This topic usually elicits statements that express concern, sorrow, or sympathy.

3. **Common","In the provided input sentence, ""CHANDLER: I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry,"" there are no overt emotional cues or emotional words that would indicate sarcasm. The sentence appears to be delivered in a formal or professional tone, lacking any exaggerated emotional language usually associated with sarcasm. The phrase ""I'm sorry"" might be used sarcastically in some contexts, given the subject matter, but without additional context, it's challenging to determine the exact emotional intent"
