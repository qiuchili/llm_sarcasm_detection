1. **Keywords**:
    - ""a slice of cheesecake and-and a date"": ""and-and"" in this context seems redundant, often used for emphasis on purpose, which generally avoids sarcasm.

1. ""Yeah"" - casual, somewhat indifferent tone, could indicate sarcasm.
2. ""a slice of cheesecake"" - positive language (enjoyment, satisfaction)

In this context, ""Yeah!"" is a shortened, enthusiastic version of ""Yes"", which could be used sarcastically to imply the opposite, expressing surprise or annoyance, rather than a genuine enthusiasm.

Some specific cues:

1. **Language Style**: The use of a shortening of the statement ""Yes"" (""Yeah!"") suggests excitement or exuberance","In the context of sarcasm detection, the cues we can extract from the input sentence are:

1. **Speaker's Emotion or Intensity:** The exclamation mark, which often signifies excitement or enthusiasm. However, in a sarcastic tone, this could imply the opposite emotion, such as annoyance or irritation.

2. **Speaker's Name:** ""Phoebe"" is the name of the speaker, which doesn't directly provide information about sarcasm but is contextually relevant for the conversation.","For sarcasm detection, emotional cues can often be found in words that express positive connotations but are used in a negative or ironic context. However, in the sentence ""PHOEBE: Yeah!"" without additional context, it's not immediately clear if it contains any explicit emotional cues indicative of sarcasm.

Given the lack of explicit positive-emotional words or contrasts, typical for sarcasm, the input sentence appears quite straightforward. Here are a few possibilities based on common patterns in sarcastic expressions:"

  - **Language Style:** The","The input sentence provided by Joey, ""Okay?"", is quite minimal and lacks context.

Nonetheless, the following cues might be considered given the ambiguously sarcastic flavor:

2. **","The input sentence ""JOEY: Okay?"" does not contain strong emotional cues necessary for sarcasm detection. However, a few words can be considered in this context:

- No emotional contrasts: There are no explicit comparisons or sudden shifts in tone that would be indicative of sarcasm.

#### Keywords:
- _What is the matter with your face?_  
   This phrase uses interrogative structure to imply concern, which aligns with _monosylabicism_ (asking for specific details) that uses a small structure of words working together with the _repetition_ of a question, heightening the sarcastic effect.

#### Rhetorical Devices:
- _Monos","### Cues:

- **Topic**: The conversation is about the speaker's physical appearance or facial expression.
- **Context**: Monica is questioning another person (indicated by ""your""), suggesting she might be addressing someone directly.
- **Common knowledge**: Typically underscores a tone of concern or perhaps confusion about the person's appearance, setting a base expectation for a literal answer related to their face.
