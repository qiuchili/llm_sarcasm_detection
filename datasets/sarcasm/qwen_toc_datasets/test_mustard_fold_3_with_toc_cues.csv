Context: Monica is reacting to a piece of news, information, or a statement from someone else, where her typical reaction would not be that of surprise or shock.
Common Knowledge: The intention is to highlight","For sarcasm detection, analyzing emotional cues in a text is crucial. In the input sentence ""MONICA: What?!?!"", there isn't a direct emotional word or contrast. However, by interpreting the context and tone, some insights might be deduced:

1. The exclamatory punctuation (!!!) suggests strong emotion.

#### Topic:
The topic of the input sentence is someone named Chandler who just woke up. There's a significant element of surprise due to the time taken to 'wake up' for this, implying maybe it was a surprising event or something that required immediate attention.

#### Context:
The context involves a state of wakefulness, transition from unconscious to conscious, where Chandler is “just waking up”. His reaction (“Ah-ha-ha!!”) implies his surprise or amusement, which is at","Emotional Words:
1. 'Ah-ha-ha'

Emotional Contrasts:
1. The speaker's action of 'waking up' as an exaggeration or overreaction, considering the context implies he's supposed to be awake or interested in the conversation. This could be interpreted as sarcastic because he's not genuinely excited or motivated to 'wake up' for the discussion.
