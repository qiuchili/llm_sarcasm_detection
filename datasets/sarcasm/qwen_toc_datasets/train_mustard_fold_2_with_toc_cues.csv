2. **Tone and Form of Address**: Addressing someone","###Output:
Topic: Mind at work, presumably referring to intellectual or creative thinking.
Context: The sentence is spoken by someone named Sheldon towards another person whose mind or thinking process he finds to be interesting or impressive. There's an implication of admiration or appreciation for the discussion or thought process.
Common knowledge: The speaker expresses a sense of honor or good fortune in being able to observe someone engaged in deep or sophisticated thinking.

1. **Emotional Words:**
   - ""limbic system"" implies a biological response or impulse, not necessarily emotional.

In context, without additional information, these words are neutral and do not carry any emotional valence by themselves.

The simplicity of the sentence and lack of context make it difficult to determine the intended emotion or tone. In sarcasm detection, cues might include contrary emotional words or contrasts in the sentence, the speaker's tone, and non-verbal expressions. In this case, without additional information, the sentence might be interpreted as neutral or possibly indicating annoyance or sarcasm depending on the context."

However, given the context of sarcasm detection, here is a breakdown using common emotional cues and contrasts:

Emotional Cues:
1. ""Uh-huh"" can be interpreted as agreement or acknowledgment. In sarcastic contexts, it might be used to mask a lack of genuine interest or as a form of"

1. **Language Style & Tone**:
   - There is a shift in expectation and tone, as to express ""The end"" in a non-sarcastic environment usually indicates some kind of conclusion or completion.
   - Emphasis on ""The end"" (capitalization).

2. **Punctuation**:
   - Use of period (full stop), which can sometimes be used to convey finality or emphasis, characteristic of a sarcast","### Contextual Cues for Sarcasm:

1. **Speaker**: ""PHOEBE""
   - *Topic*: Personality or behavior of PHOEBE, likely from a conversation or interaction in which she might make notable remarks.
   - *Context*: This phrase seems abrupt or out of place, indicating the delivery might be sarcastic if the situation or preceding dialogue does not call for a notable event or a simple statement of termination or conclusion.

2. **Phrase**: ""The end","The input sentence contains no emotional cues that could directly indicate sarcasm or provide insight into the emotional state of the speaker. 

The sentence structure itself: ""The end,"" could be used sarcastically in certain contexts where the tone or the surrounding conversation could imply the opposite of what is literally being said.

   These keywords convey uncertainty, hesitation, or surprise which can indicate sarcasm: they soften the unexpected intensity of the language and suggest the speaker's words are not as serious as they appear to be.

2. **Comma**: "","" 
   Before ""hang on a second"", this comma can make the tone of the sentence seem more casual and less urgent, suggesting that the speaker does not take the situation as seriously as they technically should.

3.","### Output:

1. **Topic**: Interaction or conversation between two people, potentially a service provider (S. Person) and a customer (C. Person). The topic isn't explicitly mentioned but could be any service or support-related query.

2. **Context**: The context clues suggest a professional service setup with roles defined as 'Service Provider' and 'Customer'. The service person expects a response from the customer but also provides space for introspection (""Think about it"") before expecting a call back.","To detect sarcasm in the provided input, we focus on identifying emotional cues, which can include emotional words and emotional contrasts.

- **""Yeah.""** - The ""Yeah"" sounds forceful instead of conveying enthusiasm, suggesting a parody of the speaker's reaction.

- **Context**:
    - It suggests that the speaker probably believes the person needs the pill for something important or serious.

1. ""Yeah"": Overuse of affirmative response, which might imply insincerity or sarcasm.
