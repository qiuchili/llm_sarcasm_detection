1. ""love more"": This phrase signals strong positive emotion and attachment.
2. ""ever gone out with"": The use of ""ever"" emphasizes the comparison and the feeling that whatever will be described is beyond previous experiences in a positive way.

Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any direct contrasts used in this sentence that could help detect sarcasm as it stands. Contrasts often involve comparing two differing aspects - for example, saying something is better"

2. ""post office"" - a specific target for sarcasm due to the unlikely nature of Chandler's desire to build one.

1. **Topic**: The topic of discussion is focused on Chandler building a post office. In this case, it's unexpected or unusual for someone like Chandler (assuming Chandler is a character likely involved in non-physical, non-construction-related activities) to build a post office, suggesting a shift from typical mundane activities to something extraordinary.

However, a few things can be interpreted as possibly indicating sarcasm:

1. **Question Tone**: The exclamation mark at the end of the sentence could be an indicator. Sarcasm often involves a question that isn't meant to be taken literally, but instead is meant to convey a different meaning or emotion.

2. Context: The negative statement ""No I am worried she might be... "" suggests that there is some uncertainty or potential danger associated with the statement subject. This adds","### Emotional Cues:

1. **Worried:** This word suggests an emotional state of concern or fear, which might be ironic if said sarcastically.

2. **Phir Resuda's:** Refers to a name or type of entity implied to be unworthy or undesirable (possibly in a disparaging or mocking way). The presence of a name or title often holds emotional connotations.
