1. **Topic**: The general subject of the sentence is conditional acceptance or willingness to receive something.

2. **Context**:
   - **Conditional Sentence Structure**: The use of ""but"" at the beginning indicates a contrasting or conditional situation.
   - **Indirect Expression**: ""If they're willing"" suggests the sentence","Emotional Cues:
1. Only if they're willing to receive one: The use of ""only if"" might imply a certain level of reluctance or conditional nature, which could potentially help in detecting sarcasm when contrasted with a more enthusiastic or positive tone.

2. Most aren't: The word ""most"" might amplify the contrast between expectations and reality if there's an underlying assumption that the contrary might exist, leading to sarcasm when emphasizing the negative outcome. The absence of any implied positive"

The sentence implies that subject matter experts -- like social workers -- are often aware of the reality of gay couples adopting, and it also addresses topics of different foreign country's adoption","Emotional cues for sarcasm detection:
1. ""There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, 'I am not homosexual.'"" - humorously exaggerated or ironic tone in presenting the absurdity of the requirement.
2. ""No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans."" - overt display of exaggerated or sarcastic distress over an irrational rule, showcasing irony as it ridicules a ridiculous and discriminatory restriction."

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.

And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend.

This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief.

**Rhetorical Devices:**
- The use of rhetorical questions such as ""Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts?"" sets up the expectation that the person is actually talking about evolution, but the ensuing response contradicts this expectation.

The input sentence ""and"" is quite short and does not contain any emotional cues. Sarcasm detection typically involves analyzing的情感词（emotional words）,情感对比（emotional contrasts）, and context clues. Since 'and' was used as a conjunction, there is no inherent emotional content or contrast that can be attributed to it in this singular form.

According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it\'s the RELATIONSHIP that I\'m comparing. That\'s what an analogy is. I\'m NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let\'s compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that\'s not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver\'s ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.

3. The expectation to ""Admit it"" denotes that there is most likely a hidden, potentially uncomfortable truth the speaker wants the listener to acknowledge.

**Common Knowledge","The emotional cues for sarcasm detection in the input sentence are:

1. ""happier"" - This appears to be used in a sarcastic context because happiness is typically not associated with someone being glad that someone else has committed a crime.

Considering atheists don\'t believe in the supernatural, there\'s nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the ""on"" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don\'t have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin\'s point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?
