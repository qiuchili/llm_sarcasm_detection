**Context**: The context is ambiguous as the sentence alone does not provide enough information. However, if the conversation or","In the provided sentence, ""You can't do anything,"" there are no direct emotional words or characteristics that solely indicate sarcasm. However, if this statement was made in a context where there is an expected reaction different from the literal interpretation, it could potentially indicate sarcasm, especially if accompanied by contrasting body language or tone that is unreasonable, exaggerated, or unbelievable.

   - No punctuation is explicitly shown in the input, but depending on the context, a sarcastic statement might use extra punctuation (e.g., unnecessary exclamation points, question marks out of expectation) to emphasize sarcasm.

2. **Context**:
   - The context of the sentence is missing, which is necessary to understand the full scenario. The presence of sarcasm often depends on certain situations or the interaction between multiple sentences.

3.","The input sentence ""Yeah."" does not contain any direct emotional cues or contrasts typically used for sarcasm detection. The word ""Yeah"" is neutral and doesn't inherently convey any specific emotion. 

However, in sarcasm detection, the context and the overall tone of the conversation or situation can provide clues. For instance, if the speaker utters ""Yeah"" after asking for help but expects a difficult or unhelpful response, it might indicate sarcasm.

1. Emotional word: ""Anyway"" - This word is used in a conversational context to introduce a point while minimizing the importance or casualness of the subject, suggesting that the speaker is aware they are saying something unexpected or exaggerated.

- **Irony**: The actual sentiment behind the words goes against the literal meaning - indication of annoyance or rebuttal despite the polite tone.

### Punctuation:","### Cues for Sarcasm Detection:

1. **Speaker and their role or relationship in context**: ""CHANDLER"" suggests this is a dialogue or communication between two characters.

Still, we can infer some general cues based on typical patterns of sarcasm:

1. **Tone**: The use of ""Uh","The emotional cues for sarcasm detection in the given sentence are not clear-cut and might require context. However, based on the sentence alone, ""Yes!"" might be seen as unexpected excitement, which could be interpreted sarcastically if it is meant to be emphatic in a negative or exaggerated way.

1. **Speaker's Name as a Placeholder (CHANDLER):** This is not a traditional use of a character's name, as typically used for reference or identification. In the context of dialogue, repeating one's own name to ask a question might be indicative of a condescending or sarcastic tone, suggesting that the speaker is aware of their own role in the dialogue and using it to mock or undermine others.

2","### Cues for Sarcasm Detection:

1. **Speaker (CHANDLER)**: The speaker is someone who typically does not undertake conversation with sarcasm, considering the context of him asking this question. The context of misunderstanding often guides this realization, particularly with respect to tenses and forms to express misunderstanding.

2. **Uttered Action**: ""Are you still enjoying your nap?"" - This question, rather than being a genuine inquiry, sounds as if it is questioning the benefactor's endurance","The input sentence does not contain any specific emotional cues that could help in sarcasm detection such as emotional words or contrasts. It appears to be a straightforward question. However, the context and tone in which this line is delivered in a specific scenario (e.g., a humorous or sarcastic tone) would be essential for identifying sarcasm. Without additional context, no extraction of emotional cues related to sarcasm can be done from the sentence itself."
