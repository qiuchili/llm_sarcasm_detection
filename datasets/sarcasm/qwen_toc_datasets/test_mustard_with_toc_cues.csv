* Topic: The speaker is referring to something that they find intriguing, memorable, or perhaps disturbing.
* Context: The sentence may be said in a tone that suggests the opposite of what the words literally state. ""Stop thinking about it"" usually implies a desire to forget something, however, the speaker is conceding that despite their willpower, they cannot stop thinking about it.
* Common knowledge: The commenter uses the term 'PENNY', which is often used as a placeholder","The emotional cue for sarcasm detection in this input sentence is the emotional word ""think"".

### Contextual Cues for Sarcasm Detection:

1. **Emotional Words:**
   - ""Relax"": Contrary to common usage, implying that the speaker thinks their audience should be tense or anxious rather than relaxed, which points towards sarcasm.
   - ""I doooo"": The prolonged ""do"" detracts from the genuine kindness often conveyed when giving reassurance (""you guys, just relax""), serving to highlight its inauthenticity and implying sarcasm.

### Explanation:

Identifying cues for sarcasm requires understanding not only individual words but also context, tone, and sentence structure. While we don't have a specific conversation or context here, we can notice several aspects in the provided text that could hint at sarcasm:

1. **Tone and word choice**: ""All right"" is a collo","The input sentence seems to be a line of dialogue from a conversation, potentially a TV show or a movie. Here are the elements to consider for sarcasm detection:

1. **Context**: The context is not explicitly given in the sentence but can be inferred based on the conversation or scene it belongs to. It likely involves a setup where Chandler (a character in the context) is making a decision or reacting to something.

2. **Topic**: The topic is the subject that is being discussed within the",The input sentence does not contain any emotional cues that would be useful for sarcasm detection.

Here are the contextual cues:

1. **Speaker**: Chandler is the speaker. His previous interactions or emotional state in the conversation can often preface the tone of the statement. If Chandler is usually very straightforward, his sudden change in manner or intonation might indicate sarcasm.

2. **Context**:","The emotional cues in this sentence include shades of ""rude"" which might contrast the actual intention or imply a mocking or sarcastic tone. The phrase ""understatement"" could also be used to denote sarcasm – Chandler making a big deal out of potentially a minor situation or implying that leaving at the moment is much more significant than it might actually be. This type of phrase tends to denote sarcasm where the intentions or the seriousness behind the words is not aligned with the emotional tone they carry."

    2. The use of ""Oh well","The emotional cue from the input sentence for sarcasm detection could be the word ""Oh well,"" which typically suggests indifference or resignation.

Linguistic cues for sarcasm detection:

1. Keywords: There are no specific sarcasm-indicative keywords in the sentence. However, ""Yeah?"" can often be a part of sarcastic dialogue as it might imply disbelief or disdain in a sarcastic context.

2. Rhetorical Devices: The sentence structure itself, an abrupt and slightly humorous "" Yeah?"" after a seemingly extraneous or inappropriately placed question, suggests sarcasm","To extract contextual cues for sarcasm detection, we will analyze the sentence ""Yeah?"" in terms of its topic, context, and common knowledge. Note that the sentence is part of a conversation, and understanding the full context requires additional information. Here's how each cue can be inferred based on the sentence alone:

#### Topic:
- **Topic**: This sentence doesn't directly indicate a specific topic but could be part of a conversation discussing various subjects like daily routines, plans, or opinions. The lack of","The input sentence ""PHOEBE: Yeah?"" does not contain direct emotional cues typically used for sarcasm detection. Regular expressions, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis tools generally look for words indicating strong emotions, phrases showing contrast between expected and actual reactions, or interjections that might indicate sarcasm.

1. **Speaker's Emphasis:**
   - The speaker, Joey, uses "" Uh-huh!"" with emphasis, indicating that he might not believe or agree with what he is hearing or might find the statement redundant or trivial.

   - An ""Uh-huh!"" response from Joey is unusual for sarcasm detection because it usually signifies acknowledgment of something that is not worthy of much consideration or is simply a non-committal response.
