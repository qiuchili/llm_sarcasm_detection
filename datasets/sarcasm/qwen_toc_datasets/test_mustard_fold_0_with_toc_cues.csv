- Linguistic Cues for Sarcasm Detection:
  1. **Irony** - Contradictory words (e.g., ""very thoughtful"" for sarcasm).
  2. **Rhetorical Question** - ""but"" serves as a transition to counterbalance the suggestive criticism or sarcasm.
  3. **Language Style** - Antagonistic tone from the context, which contrasts with a seemingly genuine appreciation.
  4. **Punctuation**","The input sentence contains several contextual cues for sarcasm detection:

1. **Topic**: The conversation or situation being discussed could be related to something that was given or done with thoughtfulness, such as a gift, a kind act, or a simple gesture.

2. **Context**: The speaker indicates a seemingly unexpected hesitation or rejection, saying ""I think I'll finish my coffee first"" after being acknowledging the thoughtful action. This suggests the speaker may not be as appreciative as the words ""very thoughtful","The emotional cues for sarcasm detection in the input sentence include:
1. The phrase ""very thoughtful"" may imply a positive tone but in a sarcastic context, depending on the overall tone of the conversation.
2. The contrast between ""very thoughtful"" (potentially meant sarcastically) and ""but I think I'll finish my coffee first"" suggests a shift in tone or expectation, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.

Emotional words:
- ""very thoughtful""
