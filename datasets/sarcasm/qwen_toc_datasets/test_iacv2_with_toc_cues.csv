1. **Topic**: The conversation might involve a discussion on online publications and videos about scientific topics, specifically touching on creationism versus evolution (ID stands for Intelligent Design, often considered in such debates).

- ""any"" to contrast ""those posts"" as short or quick vs ""an hour and a half"" time frame for watching ""Expelled"". There's a sarcastic emphasis on how it takes longer to watch a film which presumably conveys a message that gets debated (""those posts"") much quicker.

1. ""excuse me"": This phrase has a polite, somewhat self-deprecating tone, often implying the speaker is aware of possibly being out of place or mistaken.
