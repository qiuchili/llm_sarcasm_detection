1. **Keywords**:

   - ""tremendous""
   - ""tonight""
   
   The use of ""tough crowd"" in conjunction with ""tremendous"" signals a discrepancy in feelings about the performance or reception that might be perceived as sarcastic, given how ""tough"" crowds typically indicate difficult or challenging situations.

2. **Rhetorical Devices**:","Cue for Sarcasm: The phrase ""Tough crowd"" suggests that the speaker is implying that they faced opposition from their audience. The context and common knowledge related to this phrase could indicate that the speaker is actually referring to themselves, implying that they faced opposition from their expectations for the performance of Josh Smith rather than forming a genuine appreciation or praise about the actual performance. In the given sentence, tone points to the ironic or sarcastic use, with ""tremendous"" being the word","Emotional cues:
- ""Tough crowd"" implies a negative evaluation of the audience's reception, which could potentially be ironic if AndrewDBailey is actually pleased with the energetic or vocal feedback.
- ""Tremendous"" is an emotionally positive word, which used here to describe someone named ""Josh Smith"" during tonight's situation may not necessarily reflect true admiration, depending on the content of the rest of the conversation or absence thereof, therefore it could indicate sarcasm-to praise being attributed to"

- ""necrophelic"": Derived from the Greek ""necrophēle"" which means ""to love dead things"" and more generally associated with the interest in or obsession with dead bodies, often found in a morbid interest or in the context of fictional narratives, it has been transformed into describing a preference for death-related themes.
