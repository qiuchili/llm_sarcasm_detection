So geology is a religion because we weren't here to see rock X formed?,0
Well done Monty. Mark that up as your first ever 100% honest and accurate post here.,0
"But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.",0
so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?,0
"So, IOW, you are saying that those of us who are intelligent enough to realize that your non existent imaginary god doesn't exist have a chemical imbalance? Wow, that's quite a stretch even for you Archie baby.",0
"your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood.",0
"Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?",0

Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.,0
"If that is a human being, then is my kidney a human being too?",0
That would be more likely than finding evidence for abiogenesis.,0
"Wonder what ""euthanization"" is. Never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary.",0
You were crowing a bit. What I don't understand is why. How could you possibly be pleased by some strangers religious views. Would you have been pleased if he switched to liking broccoli? (Or disliking as the case may be),0
It is clear that the profetallifers wish to make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus.,0
"Well if your claim is that you shouldn't push a gun owner's buttons and make them mad, then why are you arguing with me when that's what you're claiming is the wrong thing to do?",0
"Ok...many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on....this hypocrisy annoys me.",0
And I see you still flip back and fourth from being an atheist to not being an atheist.,0
"What quaint illogic. Only people who marry can get divorced, so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates. If anything, a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than ""normal"".",0
"I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines.",0
"Really, so you are totally knowable? Show me the site that has the Mach User-Manual where I can know everything about you.",0
Then why can't you explain an unreflective fertility and abortion rates between 1972-1979 here in America or how the Polish fertility rate never increased after the 1993 referendum that criminalized abortion?   Prove to me when criminalizing abortion has ever decreased it's demand. So far you haven'tonly provided empty rhetoric. The pro-life movement thoroughly brainwashes it's supporters to believe such jibberish.,0
Proof? All I can think to say is that a mind is a terrible thing to waste.,0
"False. This is not a valid definition of atheism. Atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). Certainly, if I said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", I wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. It's called being reasonable.",0

"By all means, burn those books . . . er, I mean, take down those nativity scenes.",0
"""Supposedly""? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it.",0
"Oh? They're trained to deal with irate exhusbands who are stabbing their wives and dousing them in gasoline, in broad daylight, in the middle of a busy parking lot? They're trained to deal with that specific kind of #### every single day?",0
And a lot of blacks were killed through hangings. Are you against rope vendors?,0
And instead place my faith in the mythology of nomadic herdsmen? It is much more logical to believe in some all knowing but unknowable magic being who poofed everything into existance and then created all of the evidence to make it appear as if he didn't.,0
and gun nuts say f*** the children when we have to decide between saving guns and childrens lives,0
"well, whatever the case may be, that baby has a full function nervous system and can feel the pain whenever it is aborted. Does that not disturb you? People always tend to think ""oh the mother is going to go through pain"" BLA BLA BLA.. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABY THAT IS BEING TORTURED TO DEATH? cmon.",0
So what? The fact remains that Britain is still four times as dangerous as America in terms in crime rates. Or are you arguing that their crime level is acceptable and that you're alright with so many more people being a helpless victim unable to do anything?,0
"Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton.",0
"Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that ""informed"" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution.",0
"Oh, so business owners don't make ""real"" contributions to society?",0
It's truly amazing that even someone like KH can disprove evolution so quickly.,0
So you still choose to believe that someone who's a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves?,0
And yet all you do is present your own opinions without supporting facts.,0
"I'm sure the racist white segregationists after Plessey thought exactly as you do now, ""That settles the matter.""Little Louise Brown had a big SURPRISE!!! for them.You still have not walked upon the thin ice of the ""well regulated"" wording, we note.",0
"oh don't kid yourself, you people were miserable long before I got here. Darwinists' arrogance is astounding.",0
"Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that.",0
"Actually, everything the bible say's belies your ""atheist answer"". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life.",0
"Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. ""judicial fiat"" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals.",0
"Yes, it does. But determining that age is not a question answered by evolution.",0

"There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth. Some use 'science' to say that the world is flat. Granted that these beliefs aren't widely accepted, but then not all religions are widely accepted.

"So, you're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you'd leave right?",0
"Perhaps an analogy. Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink (personally against it, for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drink and smoke if they so choose. So, you are personally against drinking and smoking but you are ""pro-choice"" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves).Pro-life would be: You don't drink and smoke (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure that no one else is able to either.",0
Do you think humans have the pinnacle of processing power and reason in our brain for the entire universe? (aside from god),0
"That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense. Science is just a bunch of rules (by definition). ""Biology uses science to study life"" is true. ""Physics uses science to study the physical world"" is true, but ""science's purpose is to study life"" is not true.",0
"No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious.",0
"I'm not sure what you are saying. Are you saying that you think that theropod dinosaurs should have more feathers than this Sinornithosaurus does? First you claim that the entire forelimb would have been useless, and when shown that it was not you claim that the feathers could not have existed because they would be useless, and now when shown a fossil that shows feathers, you are surprised that there are not more.I suspect that not all of the feathers on this creature are apparent in the fossil.http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather5.jpg http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather9a.jpg http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather11.jpg But there are enough to show that feathered dinosaurs did, in fact exist. Any argument about whether or not is is possible that such creatures existed is moot. It is irrelevant that you feel that such limbs would have been useless.

"The claim that only through a belief in the Biblical God - or any God - can right and wrong be known is completely stupid. 1) Ever hear of humanism? 2) EVEN CHIMPS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING TREATED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY!

"Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.",0
But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.,0
"The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.",0

Actually Archie it was neither left nor right. he went after both democrat and republican and took a center tone to the entire issue at hand. Portraying the reality of the suffering of his hometown due to jobs leaving the US and the greed on wall street.,0
In your first post. If you are to qualify that by stating I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life over the ontogeny of an individual then of course reproduction is not essential character of life.,0
Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.,0
"I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.",0

"So police who are not military and are civilians, unless you are paid by the DOD and come under the geneva Convention you are a civilian period. If you had of paid attention, you should know that it is not the ""standing army"" that is fighting the current wars, it is oath taking militia/civilians from the State National Guards and reserve forces who have taken the same oath many of us have, to protect the Constitution from all enemies both domestic and foreign. That is not to say that only those people are the militia either!Can you name one successful government that has ever won a guerrilla war?

"There's no adding of firearms going on, because they're already there! The criminals have them, that's a hard fact of life that can't ever be changed. Deal with it. What we want is for the intended victims to be on equal footing with the bad guys. There's nothing unreasonable about that.",0

"You have ignored a third option, my denier of all that is right and good. That third option is the one you atheists and secular humanists refuse to consider, and that is that God spoke the stars into creation at the same time as Genesis says He spoke everything into existence in 6 days time as Genesis declares. What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive. It is like saying that because you reject the gospel of Jesus as I accurately and honestly share it with you, that it is me lying about that gospel because you have rejected it. It is the most irrational and dishonest reasoning possible, yet it defines the way your minds work. emoticonXDonno",0

The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures.

Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.",0

In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack.

You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white. That is incorrect. It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen. That is why it is known as the ""blue morph"". The ""white morph"" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the ""matter of months"" that you state), and that isn't evolution. It is evolution that the arctic foxes, like many other northern and arctic animals like the Mustelidae, have evolved the ability to change colors with the seasons.",0

Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking.

"That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be.

"A more precise term would be ""broaden,"" since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, ""diluted"" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only ""change"" would be to other  people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only ""change"" in that regard will be the fact that they are  encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.",0
"But you know it is more then just that. The poster gave a specific date that is relevant to when abortion was legalized.

"So for example if I say ""you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you"", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are ""a part"" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.",0
"Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing.

I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month.

"Theories change since they are just that - theories. Once time and sufficient investigation has given them sufficient weight, they become laws. Newton's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences (we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light) and for that regime, they remain true. Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers. Now, its the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human's experience.",0
I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.,0

Up until the turn of the 20th century marriage was about property. The man physically owned the woman and the children. I sometimes laugh at these cithgaps, espically the women, when they talk about defending the traditional marriage.

"Aside from this being completly wrong, it is quite compelling. You make a good point in regard to an organism's form only making sense in relation to its environment. Of course, this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment.

It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be ""with"" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves ""not with"" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.",0

Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.,0
"How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view.

Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is.

"Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.",0

DNA analysis has been able to distinguish brown bears from polar bears except in the case of the brown bears of the ABC islands. They are indistinguishable from polar bears.And yet, even if a brown bear where white or a polar bear were brown, they are so obviously different in morphology that they would be classified as separate species.

Despite being autosomal, people appear statistically slightly more likely to exhibit balness if the trait comes from their mother's side of the family. Even if we knew precisely which genes were involved and which of those genes your kids had, we still cannot tell you the likihood of your children being bald.

Epigenetics alone can't take one species and turn it into another, so far as anyone knows. It takes genomic restructuring, and that happens only through genetic mutation.",0

"Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.",0
"No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do.

"Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas.

Well, that will depend on your core belief system.

So, it's confirmed the findings of Miller-Urey. None of this has anything to do with evolution, however.Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time.

And yet you reject all of the discoveries of geology (the fossil record, etc.) that evolution explains perfectly. And, as Pandion said before, it stands alone and shows the fact that life has existed in other forms billions of years ago, and humans only appeared recently.   BTW, the ""fools"" that are denying the validity of Geology as a legitimate science are your fellow creationists.   As to the bible answering ""how did we get here"", it is as good and trustworthy at that as any other mythology of any other civilization.

Cumbria shootings: gunman Derrick Bird kills 12 then shoots himself - Telegraph,0
"I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.",0

They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering.

Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal.

The question is illogical.

Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible. See another thread for that topic.   The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature. To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.,0

Even if one were to suppose a god initiated the big bang, there is no reason to suppose it took an interest in subsequent events, or nudged them down one path as opposed to any other.

Someone who commits a crime that serious should at least be behind bars for the rest of their life, no parole at all. Maybe for lesser crimes (which warrant 15-30 years in prison), the Angola thing would work. But someone who has been found guilty of murder doesn't deserve the pleasure of actually working.",0

"Part of the problem with the abortion issue goes with our perception of the value of animal life in general. We see a fly and swat it. We see a rat and set a dog on it.

We don't see giant sledgehammers swatting elephants! - practicalities aside. Destruction has to be humane. And when it suits our purposes. It seems that cuddly, warm-blooded, embryo look-alikes get more emotional feeling than flies, cockroaches, mosquitos et al.

See Synonyms at business.   2. Intellectual exchange or social interaction.   3. Sexual intercourse.   While I really hope it doesn't refer to #3 and I doubt it means #2, I would think it means #1.   So it can regulate buying and selling among the states, with foreign countries, and with Indian tribes. So as long as it is sold in the state, the federal government has no power to regulate it.

My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.",0

For this reason any method of contraception poses the same threat to them as abortion does, though some methods may be easier to rally support against than others.",0

If someone gives you something, they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it, or if they had second thoughts.

"Ok, this makes sense. I do think however, that wanted pregnancies should be a part of the abortion debate, even though as you say, they usually are not. Part of the abortion issue (and the most important part, IMO) is the perception of pregnancy itself.

As Clinton himself once said, abortion should be rare.",0

"But the Court went further than necessary. They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the ""right to abortion"" ON DEMAND at any time. That was an exercise in judicial activism. They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied.

When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory.",0

But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought. I have read some discussion about various other possibilities.

The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence.

The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.",0

The essential point here is that the universal healthcare systems in Europe, Japan and Canada deliver MORE healthcare for less money. It is not the case that in Canada, healtcare is in short supply because the government is rationing it. They are ahead of us in all metrics except waiting time for non-essential surgery.

I've never had a teacher in any of the secular schools I went to say anything about God, for fear of the controversy it would create. Teachers live in fear of controversy, they don't want to get fired. I think this idea that non-Christian teachers try to convince students that God doesn't exist is a fundamentalist paranoid fantasy.   2.

In this particular instance certain organisms we call eubacteria have evolved inter- and intra-cellular communication systems--a phenomenon not found in, say, grains of sand or salt or the various molecules, atoms, quarks and other 'things' that 'bits of stuff' can be reduced to by materialist/mechanist darwinists.   **   Forgive me, but I'm the one laughing now!!

"To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.   Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted).

"After. Christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent. It arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century. From one follower of a 7th Day Adventist prophetess came ""flood geology"" in the early 20th century. Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern ""creation science."" It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.   Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible. When creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur, they decided that God had created original ""kinds"" and then allow hyper evolution after that. Creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind.",0

Conservatives want to continue the statist rewards for straight marriage only - a violation of the 14th amendment.   Libertarians combine the best of both positions.

Of course, the bottom line is that there is plenty of evidence for natural selection (along with genetic drift, gene flow, and sexual selection) as a natural mechanism for evolution, and ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR ID. This total lack of evidence for ID plus its failure to prove that natural selection could not have accounted for complexity in living organisms is really all that is needed to dismiss it at this point.",0

So you admit that the bible should be kept out of the hands of children? Is my statement about the bible somehow false? Is the brutal torture and murder of Jesus not glorified in the bible?

Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none.

Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down. But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional.",1

If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, you're saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself, just like that? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation, without a single ounce of resistance just because they're armed?",1
"I thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of Jesus was in 4 B.C. Assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of Christ, how could Christ have been born Before Christ?",1

So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here. And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science. According to you all science should be terrible. Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?,1
Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.,1
"When the pro-life movement began in the early 70's, being pro-life meant you were 100% opposed to any and all abortion. In the early 80's, that standard was watered down to include those who had rape, incest, and the life of the mother exceptions. Now in the 90's, things have declined so rapidly that someone who is only opposed to partial-birth abortions can sell themselves as pro-life.""- Pastor Matt Trewhella   How does that crow taste?",1
"which is pretty much the same thing. The majority of representatives get their way. The representatives are elected by a majority. Being overally picky about it gets you no where...we pretty much have a majority rules nation.   And we still haven't settled the question about how you think you can impose your belief on others but I can't. The ""convention"" idea didn't work, the idea that you aren't imposing a belief on others didn't work, so what is next?",1
Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.,1
"Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.",1

Really? Let's see you show that the God that you believe in is that God.. and that this God even exists outside the imaginations of the mind?,1
"and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.",1

Placing children with gay couples is unnecessary and harmful - if group homes are the only alternative then it is argued such environments are more healthy and indeed normal than farming kids out to gays",1

You show me the post where I said I thought terrorists killing children was a good idea and I will eat my keyboard.,1
"Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that ""...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed."" Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.",1

A very vocal advocate of his field (and it WAS his field) and quite a character. Of course I met him in the morning and perhaps he was on a chronobiological peak at the time who can say. Anyway I did get access to the plotter for some chemical work I was doing, and I learned a bit about his work and interests. Productive meeting.",1

"Okay I don't care what you call it, but let's take it back to the human being part.

And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?,1

"Yes, prove it by science. I don't want you to keep reverting to word games/sophistry; philosophical arguments. You must prove it by science. Show me the scientific experiment that proves it. I've asked you a number of times, and every time you've failed to do so.",1
"Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system.",1

And Creationists who can't tell the difference between cats and nuclear reactors don't understand fluid mechanics.,1
"No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is.",1
"Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in ""evolutin"" [sic].

It is based on evidence and not faith.",1

"And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, ""There can be no liberty without virtue."" Someone else once said, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings"".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - ""The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur.",1
"Actually, if you read the friggin article (*GASP* HERESY!!!), you'd see that this guy was attacked while WALKING FROM THE STORE.

"NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!",1

Creation fiction has made no progress with it's ""faith-based"" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach",1

I have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes. Its when they crawl out from under their rocks that I have a problem.

"You mean you are not going to pretend to you understand it. It means that your argument stating that flaws in the death penalty lay in the judicial system is like me saying that flaws in life imprisonment lay in our prison's security system; not in the punishment itself.

And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.,1
Not all threads need to be courttroom style debates. If you choose to aid in establishing a working consensus fine. If you want simply to rave and rant there are plenty of venues where you can do that. Your participation is welcome as long as you are a participant and are seriously trying to resolve the issue. Otherwise for heavens sake go do something else.,1

With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ?

"I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above.",1
I see. Then what you are claiming is that creationists are the ones who should define the vocabulary to be used by evolutionary biologists. Would it then be ok for atheists to define the vocabulary of Christianity?,1

Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....,1
"OMG SO TRUE!!! Two of my friends chose to be asian, my mom chose to be a woman, and my PE teacher chose to be black. OMGZZ@! YOURE SO RIGHT!!!",1
"Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the ""United Arab Emirates"" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?
Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!",1
"That board is full of XXXX. I didn't read what the preacher had to do with it but I guess the preacher (if he was involved with the board) is full of XXXX also. Perhaps they all need a good laxative to get rid of that XXXX.

"Man. You just refuse to get it.
You think liberals are asking this cause we're greedy?
We are trying to HELP OTHERS.
Something Christians should be interested in...",1
I'm guessing that nobody wanted to fish it out of the toilet bowl. ;),1
"Look, the ""no one was around to see it"" argument. ""If a tree falls in the woods, and no one was around to see it, did it really fall?"" You lost this one a long time ago, too. You never learn.",1
"Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone? Either you are again using words you don't know the meaning of to make such an inaccurate statement, or you're just lying. So which is it penfold, are you ignorant or just being dishonest again? emoticonXConfused",1

"A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.",1

Let me add a little extension to what you have accurately portrayed: or 'bring back the gallows and the guillotine:emoticonXSmilie,1

And here the assi once again refuses to respond to a valid post as he personally insults a member who shows more intelligence and wisdom than he does in every post COBHC writes. And this coming from a guy who is barely out of his teens himself. Hypocrite much assipiter? emoticonXRolleyes,1

"I think if you pay any attention, you'll find only hetero characters in Dr. Seuss. I'm sure if there were any suggestion of gay Whos for Horton to hear, the right-wing, anti-gay, pseudo-christians (specific enough for you?) would be trying to ban Seuss, too.",1

"Indeed true. God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor. Man created a vindictive, vengeful, and vicious god, according to the Bible. So where does a loving god come from?",1
"Me, too. I'd probably throw in some counseling as well, just for starters.",1
A load of unowhat repeated for many years now. Junk science commissioned to get results that were desired. Check out lung cancer rates for Rastafarians. Nothing abnormally high. Gateway my arse.,1
"And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be. I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end.",1

"I love this line. I assume by ""harm"" you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another (physical in this case includes loss of items). So this would cut our laws in half. Walk around naked?

"If we were to debate whether God made us perfect as he could have, then of course we can make the point that he obviously doesn't exist.",1

"Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions.",1
"Yeah.. caught that... But, hey.. I think you made a mistake.",1
"I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?",1

And from where did you get this idea? Please provide your references.,1
What is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?,1
"You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.",1

"Actually yes, but not for the purposes of ilegal search or seisure, I have active duty military friends. They drop by all the time. Obviously your great lack of friends makes that idea hard to understand.",1
Great way of twisting what I said. Would you like a Snickers bar?,1
"And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work.",1
"So you're claiming that you ""transformed"" from part of your mother to a human. So you're claiming that you were once almost your mom's arm or leg? lol! Biologically, this is simply a farce statement.",1
"So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all.",1
ROFLMAO! Nice way of restating the 'inaccurate' statement basically the same way.,1
I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?,1
"Because the NY Times, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity. Yeah.",1
"Of course God would have something to offer to lowely peon, but that doesn't explain what use God has for lowely peons, except for doing stupid pet tricks.",1
you always run and hide behind Bryan like the true coward you are,1
"You should watch where you cast stones, kido. Your original post is an example of a straw man...not mine. You should be more careful before operating a gun...you just yourself in the foot. LOL!",1
"You mental midgets insult my intelligence when you aren't even aware that the word omnibenevolent isn't even found in the Catholic Online - Catholic Encyclopedia . In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever. But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about.",1
Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.,1
"And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.",1
"Yeah so what? I left the UK, I'm free now.",1
"So scientists are doing science, lots of it. Check the August 2007 issue of Evolution, for example. On the other hand IDists produce nothing, do no lab work, but just harp and harangue against evolution. As the article says, ""Its passionate diatribes virtually advertise the program they attack. People must fight for something that they want to achieve, not simply reject an evil, however bad it may be. Shoe fits you lot, WW, not us.",1
Could it partially be the fact that they don't want antiquated belief system dogma making their decisions? Must have access to a sonogram sounds like a lobby group attempting to sway opinion while enhancing revenue. Does the legislation force pregnant women who have not chosen abortion to have a sonogram? Raising children creates post-delivery stress syndrome.,1
"Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem. I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year.   What school are you at?",1
"Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?",1
These official groups are jokes. Armed citizens are much more effective.,1
So then I guess you could also debate that algebra serves no purpose as well.,1
This is a laughable oversimplication of reproduction. Humans don't make copies. Do you reproduce asexually? I know I don't.,1
"Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask ""Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself"" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position.",1
"Here you are making an entirely unsooprted assumption, that I see myself as better than everybody else or that I am somehow smug in my views. I am no better or worse than most. We are all just the same tailess monkeys that walked out of the jungle so many millions of years ago. we are not particularly enlightenend, nor are we likely to become so.",1
Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.,1
If you dont believe that muslims love life they will cut your head right off! Its an easy choice if you ask me.,1
So what? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically?,1
Seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie. Just could wait for that case of M-1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt.,1
"So, when a comedian leaves the stage and say's I killed tonight, then obviously killing people en-masse is just fine, right?",1
"Really? What book is that, because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page. So once again accipiter, what in the world are you referring to? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with.   Here's my original post again, I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs, from skeletal remains?",1
"The US is 3 trillion dollars in debt, abortion is not clear cut (just visit a debate), and you appear to be stereotyping democrats. Also, you may need to read the first ammendment again. For your answer to work, people would have to agree with you first, then they would understand (and agree with) you.",1
"It depends. Do you feel the same way about the Yeti? How about the Lock Ness monster?   You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.'   I think it is intellectual fence sitting myself. I feel the same way about God as i do about fairies, the yeti, alien abductions, and 'psychic powers'. There is no evidence that any of these exist, so based on the evidence, I don't believe they exist. Should new evidence be forthcoming, I will reevalutate my position based on that evidence.",1
On the other hand abortion is only opposed by the born and wars are started only bu the born and choices are made etc etc etc etc.,1
In the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.,1
"I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us.   (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to ""represent"" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)",1
"Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.",1
"How strange. It seems that Habbit's definition of the word definition is meaningless. Physicists and chemists can define what they mean by the word ""carbon,"" but according to Habbit that is just their opinion. According to Habbit, carbon can be a chocolate candy meant to be eaten in a car. That may be his opinion and he considers it as valid as specific definitions assigned to words used by experts in any given field.",1
"Like I said, Catholic school. Or it could be that you're like 80 years old or something, because nowadays, if you talk about God or the Bible, then you don't get in trouble, you get criticized and made-fun-of, not only by your peers, but also by teachers.",1
Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.,1
That is the only purpose it was created for. One must wonder if BS can have several uses to man and ID has but one which is the more valuable?,1
Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?,1
How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.,1
"Thank God you have that unfortunate government. It permits you the opportunity to decide on how justice is defined and how it may best be served for all of us.   In a perfect world these types of choices would not be necessary, but then in a perfect world there would be no purpose for religion. We do the best we can in proportion to how much we care. Want a different government vote. Want a better government vote wisely. Want a better government quickly. Get others to do the same.",1
"Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile.",1
"wow....there is a real person under there. Good luck on your recovery, chemist.",1
"Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact.",1
Using Bush as a 180 compass is just fine by me.,1
"That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.   I certainly think it was excessive. I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic.",1
Chill on the name calling. it only weakens your position in a debate. If you want to prove a point do so with logic and evidence. Leave the name calling to 5 year olds!,1
When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime? And don't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone?,1
I won't waste my time with trolls here. Do you have anything useful to say?,1
"You must be thinking of physics... last I looked, biologists weren't trying to explain the the creation of the universe. However, we have an excellent handle on the evolution of species, and some pretty reasonable ideas about the origin of life, which is more than your bible ever came up with. I mean... some invisible, bearded guy-in-the-sky zapped it all into existence? Fairytales.",1
"Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called ""Ex Nihilo"" (changed to ""Creation"" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)",1
"Which is why 50 million Americans are uninsured, including 9 million children. With 27,000 from that group dying every year, as a result of ""freedom"", and unpaid hospital bills the leading cause of bankruptcy and homelessness. Also for the other 50 million who are underinsured.",1
"Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it",1
"Well, you must not be a GOP lawmaker or the President of the United States. They're convinced that the only way to prevent the SCOTUS finding in favor of same-sex marriage is to amend the Constitution.",1
"Funny how people who are ""for"" capital punishment don't see it that way...",1
You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.,1
"So you're saying that God is a ""respector""?-of-persons - iow, the mom's ""more""-important to *God*? than the unborn.",1
No I can't marry them becasue some of them are married. Also none have intent to li ve within Mass.,1
Just as you and your favorite group are master manipulators of emotion amongst the uneducated. Yes we do need to pay attention to the great danger you and your ilk pose. We need to shine the light of truth on your lies and expose them.,1
"Really? Wow, I didn't know that books with their edjumacational benefits...",1
"Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.",1
"What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example.",1
OH FREE MARKET???? IM goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.",1
"April was ""recent"" ? Please provide evidence from the memo of these ""examples"".",1
Come back when you learn the difference between climate and weather.,1
"Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.",1
"More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.",1
Don't forget Ted Kennedy. My question is what kind of machine guns his body guards have? MP5s or UZIs,1
"Your knowledge of history is frightening. We saw how well Sarbane-Oxley, the most far-reaching intrusion into corporate America since FDR, prevented our recent crash. A crash that was precipitated by Clinton's edict to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to loosen up the purse strings so deadbeats could get mortgages.",1
But surely it's ok to vote for a man who starts an unjustified war that results in the deaths of hundreds of thousands...right?,1
"And without a limited lifespan there would be no death. But we don't live in such a world, so shut up and get onto a more relevant topic.",1
"how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport.",1
"Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.",1
So how are those gun free zones working out for you?,1
So you are saying that we determine our DNA? Do you actually think before typing?,1
"And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you.",1
"What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want.",1
"So your answer to the question then is ""Nothing"", Marc?",1
Well lets speculate about how many possible explanations we could concoct if left to supposition. I'm talking about the only two explanations for the origins of life that have ever been entertained as viable empirically testable concepts in modern science.,1
"And so wasn't the universal opinion that homosexuality is unnatural, wrong and to no benefit to Society at all.",1
"Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems.",1
"Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making.",1
You mean you equate the Bible with your own theory?(which is lacking information).,1
"Well then, using just the Bible, what is the value of pi to the third decimal point?",1
And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?,1
"But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar.

Who but a creationist would ever make such a laughable claim?,1

"This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical ""husband and wife"" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)",1
"Via something called ""evidence"". It is something that a creationist will never have come across, thus explaining why you are unaware of it.",1
"Oh so I take it the drug dealer was a law abiding citizen who had obtained his firearm legally and used the shotgun in self defence? I though not. Just out of personal interest lets say you took away the rights of the law abiding to own guns how would that shooting be stopped, cus i am pretty sure the drug dealing criminal would still get his gun Illegally.   A gunner you say went on a massacre? I am pretty sure you mean a criminal went on a massacre and maybe if somebody like Doc or Old sarge was there the end death tally would have been alot different.",1
So penfold and brady you are in favour of denying citizens rights even though they have not been proved to have commited any crime? Ed Kennerdy was on that list so should he be discriminated against even though he has commited NO crime? What is next putting black people on the list purely because of the colour of their skin?   You sicken me you two. Why on gods earth would terrorists be buying civilian guns when they could just use AK47? Did you sniff petrol as a youngster as you seem to have.,1
"Just can't satisify ""them thar' Moralizers."" I remember the election of 1960, and how many were worried about JFK taking his ""orders from Rome."" Maybe that is why we are a land of laws, not of men.",1

And I suppose you feel it would've been better if she died at the hands of a knife-wielding killer?,1
Oh - so you don't want to force me through pregnancy at any cost to me? You will let me make what decision is best for me? You will actually realize that I am in the best position to know?,1
Why? You'll just call them 'stupid'. And by doing so you will have effectively trumped all of the facts in one fell swoop. Right?,1
Of course. What a stupid question! The Gods can do what they damned well please.,1
So conservatives can give shout their brand of lies as the truth but a liberal who calls them on it isn't being tolerant?,1

"I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents.

NO! And it has nothing to do with expressing views different from mine. These XXXXXX are spending good money to advertise against a God they believe PROBABLY doesn't exist. All I have to say is thanks for proving how irrational and stupid atheists are.,1
"So how many locusts, beetles etc. were there on the Ark?   Do you think that there were a pair of each species, or just a pair of each ""Biblical Type"" and could you define what is meant by that term?   Would that include all beetles/insects/arthropods/invertebrates or just anything you felt was convenient?",1
So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians didn't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws?,1
"So it's not safe to go to school because your teacher might kill you if you're late at turning in your homework?   Incidents such as the shooter professor are incredibly rare; you'll find very few school teachers that were convicted of murder during a previous date, and released from prison due to a favor from a politician.   But incidents like the one in the UK, where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim, are far more common and close to the norm for the country. If you're attacked, you're guilty if you fight back and cause either harm or fear to the person attacking you. Even if they assault you with a deadly weapon, you're the guilty party if you manage to cause them any sort of harm.",1
"So much bandwidth; so little substance.   Aren't you embarrassed to post such inconsistent ramblings?   Women with pre-existing mental problems are more likely to experience post-abortion issues. Well, DUH!!!",1
"they can refuse any ceremony they want. That it has been \""open to all for years\"" carries no weight whatsoever. It is church property--which is essentially the same as a church saying it doesn't want gay ceremonies in its sanctuary which churches are free to refuse. Maybe churches are imposed upon in such ways in Canada  but not in the US.Given these matters  I'm not sure the HRC is being any more honest than the video they are responding to."" So then if I owned a business or a piece of property I could then refuse to sell or accommodate fundamentalist anti gay Christians and \That it has been \""open to all for years\"" carries no weight whatsoever.\"" It is my property and I don't like the immorality of fundamentalist anti gay Christians.""",1
"So why is this killing in DC on the news, when so many previous ones were ignored and treated like they didn't exist?   Didn't the report say the police recovered a so called ""assault rifle"" from the suspects? Something that's supposed to be banned under current DC laws? Aren't magazines above 10 rounds also banned? How'd this killing happen if these two features are completely banned within DC and not available to anyone there?",1
"So you're kind of like a crimelord who claims to be a pacifist because he has thugs on the payroll who do the dirty work for him?   ""Ah well you see, my personal morality prohibits violence, but that doesn't inhibit me from financing, applauding and demanding violence be done on my behalf whenever it suits me. You see, as long as my hands don't directly commit the violence, I am pure as snow"".   In other words, you're discussing when government should use violence. Which according to you, is a lot of the time. Especially should someone dare to defend themselves against a home invader.   You really don't see the hypocrisy in condemning someone for violence and simultaneously calling for more violence, do you?",1

"The lovely thing about our system of justice, is, if a citizen acts, his actions are judged for appropriateness, and if found to be unlawful, he/she must stand in a court of law an be held accountable for them.   Brady on the other hand, wants to skip all of that justice stuff, and hang us all, just because we follow the Constitution and our laws, and dare to have the AUDACITY to actually believe in both, and own a Constitutionally recognized as Inalienable Right, gun!

Good thing that reality  truth  sanity  and rightness  are not matters of democratic vote and popularity contests. I guess. Except among you darwinists  of course.**No  it has not  despite what you and your girlfriend say. And  whether it supports my POV  as I believe it does  is not the point. The point is that my POV is valid  scientific  and becoming increasingly accepted  while your darwinist boat  riddled with leaks and worm holes from day one  is finally being allowed to sink to the bottom without further plugging up and bailing out.""

"We've posted this excellent piece before. The anti-gay crowd (even the anti-gays who surreally style themselves as ""pro-gay"" -- so they can bash gays and still get into heaven...they think) NEVER respond to it, so thoroughly does it explode all their pitiful ""arguments.""",1

"Where is the government in this? Clinicians made a clinical decision, and hid behind a non-mandatory guideline, which was set by other more senior clinicians, expert in their field.

I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders.
