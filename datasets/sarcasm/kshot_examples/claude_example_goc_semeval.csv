"input:
what an irony! the police divide us, the terrorists unite us! #terrorism #policebrutality

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text. the contrasting concepts of ""divide"" and ""unite"" paired with the exclamation ""what an irony!"" strongly suggest sarcasm. the hashtags further reinforce the controversial topics being addressed sarcastically. this combination of elements provides a reasonably clear indication of sarcastic intent, even if not 100% certain.

label:
given the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement uses irony explicitly and juxtaposes contrasting concepts (divide vs. unite) in an unexpected way, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. the exclamation marks and the use of hashtags further emphasize the sardonic tone of the message. the speaker is using sarcasm to critique a perceived societal contradiction, making this a clear example of sarcastic expression.",1

label:
not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message about a smartphone app that can help raise money for a church. the use of capitalization, abbreviations, and multiple links is typical of social media marketing, especially on platforms like twitter with character limits. the exclamation point and emphasis on ""app pays you!"" convey enthusiasm rather than sarcasm. the direct addressing of specific users (@revarun @c_of_e) and the provision of multiple informational links also suggest this is a genuine attempt to share information about the app, not a sarcastic comment. therefore, based on the content and style of the message, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0

so ally mccoist hands his notice in and gets a pay rise,he really has rangers best interests at heart

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, i believe the identified cue of sarcasm is likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in this text. the stark contrast between mccoist's actions (handing in notice and getting a pay rise) and the statement about having the club's best interests at heart creates a clear sarcastic tone. this single cue provides a strong indication of the overall sarcastic intent, even if there's a small possibility of misinterpretation.

label:
based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""he really has rangers best interests at heart"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. this sarcasm is evident when contrasted with the actions described in the first part of the sentence - mccoist handing in his notice and getting a pay rise. these actions typically do not align with having the club's best interests at heart, making the final statement ironic and sarcastic in nature.",1

36 hours no food no drink going strong  #givemeabrew :person_with_folded_hands::loudly_crying_face::hot_beverage:

steps:
no

while these linguistic cues provide helpful context, they are not definitively sufficient to determine sarcastic polarity with high confidence. the informal style, hashtag use, and emojis could be consistent with either sincere or sarcastic intent in this case. more contextual information or clearer indicators of irony would be needed to make a confident judgment about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
yes

label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

2. the contrast between claiming to be ""strong"" while simultaneously begging for a drink (brew) with the hashtag and emojis suggests sarcasm.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – strength vs. desperation – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

given these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this text.",1

maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed in obtaining world peace?  #missworld2014

steps:
no

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.",1

steps:
no

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues are not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this short text. the title phrased as a question and the link to a forbes article don't provide enough context to determine if sarcasm is present. more content from the actual article or surrounding discussion would be needed to make that assessment with reasonable confidence.

my confidence in this judgment is about 70%. the given cues provide some context about the text being a headline or title for an article, but they don't offer enough specific information about sarcastic elements or tone to conclusively determine sarcastic polarity. without more details about the content or style of the full article, it's difficult to assess whether sarcasm is present or not.
next_cue_response:language style
no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question about obamacare's impact on health care spending, shared as a tweet with a link to a forbes article. without more context or content from the actual article, it's not possible to determine if there's any sarcastic intent behind the question.

2. it's phrased as a neutral question about a serious topic (healthcare spending).
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
4. the source (forbes) is a reputable business magazine, typically associated with factual reporting rather than sarcastic commentary.
5. the language is concise and direct, which is common for social media shares of news articles.

the text seems to be a genuine inquiry into the effects of obamacare on healthcare spending, likely leading to an informative article on the topic. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.",1

the whole #misogyny thing is hanging in there with women from the right . a cat fight now ?, imagine pulling that on the left #pmlive

steps:
yes

while there is some room for uncertainty, i believe these cues are likely sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in this text. the juxtaposition of serious topics like misogyny with casual language like ""cat fight,"" along with the implied contrast between right and left reactions, strongly suggests sarcastic intent. however, without full context, there remains a degree of ambiguity, which is why i'm not 100% certain.

label:
based on the provided context and the content of the input text, i would classify this as:

label: sarcastic

the text appears to be using sarcasm to comment on the perceived double standard in how discussions about misogyny are handled when involving women from different political alignments. the use of phrases like ""cat fight"" and ""imagine pulling that on the left"" suggest a mocking tone towards the situation, implying that such characterizations would be considered unacceptable if applied to left-wing women. the sarcasm is employed to highlight this perceived inconsistency in treatment.",1
"input:
btw, dummy, 140 limits @rbrnetwork1 @1_free_man @thelexzane @anan_vii @abpt_rocket @kusun0

steps:
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe these cues are likely insufficient to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the content appears to be a twitter-style message with usernames and a reference to character limits, but there's not enough contextual information or clear indicators of tone to confidently determine sarcasm. more context or the full content of the message would be needed for a more accurate assessment.

label:
based on the available cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward social media post, likely from twitter, given the mention of ""140 limits"" and multiple twitter handles.
2. there's no evident contrast between literal and intended meaning, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
3. the language used is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or mockery.
4. the word ""dummy"" could be seen as mildly insulting, but its use here doesn't seem to indicate sarcasm.
5. the overall structure and content of the message appear to be informational rather than sarcastic.

while the context is limited, the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit fragmented, communication on a social media platform.",0
