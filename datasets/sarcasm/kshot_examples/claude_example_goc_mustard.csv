"input:
dorothy: no rose, at a pie eating contest.

steps:
no

while there's some uncertainty without more context, this single line of dialogue doesn't provide sufficient cues to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the statement could be straightforwardly answering a question, or it could potentially be sarcastic, but there's not enough information from this line alone to make that determination with confidence.
next_cue_response:language style
yes

label:
sarcastic

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.",1
"input:
ross: we- we had our first fight this morning.

steps:
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe these cues are not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this text. the given keywords and sentence alone don't provide clear indicators of sarcastic intent. more context about the tone, situation, or surrounding dialogue would likely be needed to make a confident determination about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:context
no

while the given cues provide some context, they are not sufficient to definitively determine whether the statement is sarcastic or not. the information provided is mostly factual and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. to detect sarcasm, we would typically need more indicators such as tone, exaggeration, contrast between literal and intended meaning, or additional context about ross's personality or the situation. without more information, it's not possible to confidently determine the sarcastic polarity of this text.

no
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
no

my judgment is that these cues are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. the provided information gives context about the speaker, situation, and language style, but does not provide clear indicators of sarcasm. sarcasm often relies on tone, context beyond what's given here, and more extensive language cues that are not present in this brief statement. while i'm not 100% certain, i'm confident enough to answer ""no"" within the allowed 40% uncertainty margin.

while the provided cues offer some useful context and linguistic analysis, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this short text. sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, wider context, and sometimes knowledge of the speaker's typical communication style - elements that are not fully captured in the given cues. the statement could be sincere or sarcastic depending on factors not evident in the provided information.
next_cue_response:common knowledge

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward description of a recent event.
2. there's no indication of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the hesitation in speech (""we- we"") implies sincerity and potentially emotional vulnerability.
4. the context suggests this is part of a personal narrative or conversation, where ross is likely sharing information about his relationship honestly.
5. there are no contradictory elements or unexpected twists that might indicate sarcastic intent.

the text appears to be a genuine statement about ross experiencing his first fight in a relationship, without any sarcastic undertones.",0
"input:
chandler: i am sorry, it was a one time thing. i was very drunk and it was someone else's subconscious

steps:
no

while the emotional words provide some context, they are not sufficient on their own to definitively determine sarcastic polarity in this case. the statement could be genuinely apologetic or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone, and delivery, which are not fully captured by just these emotional cues. additional information or context would be needed to make a more confident assessment of sarcasm.
next_cue_response:context
no

while the provided cues offer some insight into the emotional tone and context of the statement, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. the statement could be genuinely apologetic or potentially sarcastic, depending on the broader context, tone of delivery, and relationship between the speakers. without additional information such as vocal inflection, body language, or more extensive dialogue, it's challenging to determine with certainty whether sarcasm is present.
next_cue_response:language style
no

the provided cues offer some helpful context and analysis, but they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while the language style and content suggest potential for sarcasm or humor, especially with the absurd claim about ""someone else's subconscious,"" we don't have enough information about the tone, delivery, or broader context to confidently determine if the statement is genuinely sarcastic or just humorously evasive. more context about the situation, the speaker's typical manner of speech, and the reaction of other characters would be needed to make a clear determination about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:rhetorical devices
no

the provided cues offer valuable context and analysis, but they are not entirely sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while the rhetorical device of hyperbole is identified, which can be associated with sarcasm, the overall tone and intent remain somewhat ambiguous without additional context or delivery cues (like tone of voice or facial expressions). the statement could be interpreted as a genuine, if humorously exaggerated, apology or as a sarcastic comment, depending on the broader context and delivery. therefore, more information would be needed to confidently determine sarcastic polarity.
next_cue_response:punctuation
no

while the provided cues offer valuable insights into the text's content, tone, and style, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. the cues provide good context and analysis, but sarcasm often relies heavily on additional factors such as delivery, broader context, and the speaker's typical manner of speech. without more information about chandler's character or the full context of the conversation, it's challenging to determine with certainty whether this statement is genuinely apologetic or sarcastic.
next_cue_response:common knowledge
no
next_cue_response:keywords
no

the provided cues offer some useful context and analysis, but they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while we have information about the emotional words, language style, and rhetorical devices used, sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, delivery, and broader context that may not be fully captured in these cues. the statement could be genuinely apologetic or sarcastically insincere, and without additional context or cues about chandler's typical speech patterns or the situation he's referencing, it's difficult to determine the sarcastic polarity with high confidence.
next_cue_response:topic
no
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts

label:
based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.",1
"input:
sheldon: frankly, mom, i'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become-- willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.

steps:
yes

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

label:
based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.",1
"input:
rachel: oh my god!! ohh, that is it! i'm leaving! you are just a horrible person!

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, the cues provided offer strong indications of emotional contrasts and extreme reactions that are often associated with sarcasm. the rapid shift from excitement to anger and harsh judgment, along with the exaggerated language, suggests a potentially sarcastic tone. however, it's important to note that context beyond these cues would provide even greater certainty in determining sarcastic polarity.

label:
based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: not sarcastic

the text shows a genuine emotional outburst with clear progression from shock to anger to a harsh judgment. the exclamations and the rapid shift in emotions indicate sincere, intense feelings rather than sarcastic undertones. the directness of the statements, especially the final accusation ""you are just a horrible person!"", suggests that rachel is expressing her true feelings without any irony or sarcasm.",0
"input:
chandler: oh yeah right. and what would my opening line be? excuse me

steps:
no

while these cues provide some context, they are not sufficient on their own to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the given text. chandler's character from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic tone, but without more context or information about the tone and delivery, it's difficult to be certain about the sarcastic intent in this specific line. additional cues like tone indicators, surrounding context, or more detailed dialogue would be needed to make a more confident assessment of sarcasm.
next_cue_response:context
no
next_cue_response:language style
yes

label:
sarcastic

the input text shows clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism.
2. the rhetorical question ""and what would my opening line be?"" suggests chandler is mocking the idea.
3. the abrupt ""excuse me"" at the end appears to be chandler sarcastically imagining a weak opening line, further emphasizing his skepticism about the suggestion.

given chandler's character (likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor), and the context provided in the cues, this response is definitely sarcastic in nature.",1
"input:
chandler: i can see it from right here. it'll cost you one husband.

steps:
no. the current cues do not provide sufficient context to definitively determine if sarcasm is present in the given text. while the line appears to be a witty remark, more surrounding dialogue and situational context would be needed to confidently assess whether it's intended as sarcasm or just a humorous comment.
next_cue_response:language style
no.

the provided cues give some helpful context about the tone and style of the text, but they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. while the line appears witty or humorous, sarcasm specifically requires additional context about the speaker's true feelings or the broader situation to be clearly identified. the current information leaves too much uncertainty about whether this remark is genuinely sarcastic or simply a playful joke.
next_cue_response:context
no
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
no

my judgment is that these cues are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the given text. while the analysis provides some helpful context about the style and tone, there isn't enough information to confidently determine if sarcasm is present or not. the line could potentially be sarcastic, but it could also be a straightforward joke or quip without sarcasm. more context about the surrounding conversation and chandler's typical speaking style would be needed to make a clearer assessment of sarcastic intent.

next_cue_response:emotional words
no. 

while the provided cues offer some useful context about the style, tone, and structure of the text, they are not sufficient to definitively detect the sarcastic polarity. the cues suggest a humorous or witty remark, but sarcasm often requires more context or knowledge of the speaker's typical manner of expression to be accurately identified. without additional information about the surrounding conversation or the character's usual communication style, it's challenging to determine with certainty whether this statement is genuinely sarcastic or simply a playful joke.
next_cue_response:common knowledge

label:
based on the cues provided and my analysis of the input text, i would label this as:

sarcastic

the line appears to be a witty, humorous remark from the character chandler, likely from a tv show. the sarcastic tone is evident in the exaggerated statement about something costing ""one husband,"" which is not a literal price but a joking way to suggest something is very expensive or undesirable. this kind of playful hyperbole is characteristic of sarcastic humor.",1
"input:
bernadette: yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before.

steps:
no

while i cannot be 100% certain without more context, based solely on the given text and cues, there does not appear to be sufficient information to detect sarcastic polarity. the statement seems relatively straightforward, and the analysis provided does not indicate any clear markers of sarcasm. however, there is some uncertainty, as sarcasm can sometimes be subtle or dependent on broader context not provided here.
next_cue_response:context
no

while the provided cues give some context about bernadette's statement, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the text. the cues describe the statement as straightforward and lacking clear emotional contrasts, which suggests an absence of sarcasm. however, without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to be completely certain about the presence or absence of sarcasm in this isolated statement.

2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.

4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.",0

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0

monica: well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuinely concerned or anxious statement from monica about a potentially uncomfortable situation. the use of informal language, emotional punctuation (interrobang ?!), and the context of worry about someone's reaction all point to a sincere expression of concern rather than a sarcastic remark. the emotional contrast between the current state and anticipated future reaction further supports the sincerity of the statement. there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm in the phrasing or context provided.",0
"input:
howard: right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

steps:
yes.

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

label:
sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.",1

no

while i'm not 100% certain, i'm about 70% confident that these punctuation cues alone are not sufficient to detect sarcasm in this text. the punctuation mainly indicates pauses and hesitation, which could be present in both sincere and sarcastic speech. without additional context, tone indicators, or content analysis, it's difficult to determine sarcasm based solely on these punctuation cues.

no

while there is some uncertainty due to the limited context, i'm fairly confident (at least 60%) that the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues correctly point out the lack of context and inability to determine emotional contrasts, which are often key elements in identifying sarcasm. without additional information or context, it's not possible to reliably detect sarcasm in this brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:context
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.",0

i'm about 70% confident in this answer. the cues provided offer a good analysis of the language style and tone, highlighting elements like mild sarcasm, unusual phrasing, and contrasting viewpoints that are often indicative of sarcastic speech. while more context could potentially increase certainty, these cues seem sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in chandler's statement, especially given his character's well-known tendency for sarcasm in the show ""friends.""

label:
based on the analysis of the language style and context provided, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

chandler's statement exhibits classic elements of sarcasm, particularly his deadpan delivery contrasting others' potential amusement with his own affected indifference. the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is a clear example of dry humor, understating his reaction in a way that actually emphasizes the amusing nature of whatever is being discussed. this kind of sardonic comment is very characteristic of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic wit.",1

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.",1
