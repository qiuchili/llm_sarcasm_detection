1,"Input: ""no! and it has nothing to do with expressing views different from mine. these xxxxxx are spending good money to advertise against a god they believe probably doesn't exist. all i have to say is thanks for proving how irrational and stupid atheists are.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

1,"Input: ""fyi you'll get sand in your ears from sticking your head in too deep....""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward warning or advice about a physical action (sticking one's head in sand) and its consequence (getting sand in ears).

- the second sentence abruptly shifts focus to a christian group, which seems to contradict the initial criticism of ""lazy"" protesters.
- the use of ""psssst!"" and the sudden revelation about the burning bush group implies the author is revealing something unexpected or ironic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface criticism of protesters contrasts sharply with the revelation about a christian group's involvement.

step 3: comparison and analysis

- the statement appears to be critical, using phrases like ""rates an 8 out of 10 on the hypocracy scale"" and ""weren't you just scolding people""
- the ""tsk tsk"" at the end conveys disapproval

step 2: true intention

his mother is white, from kansas; and his father black, from africa (kenya to be exact). now he's a true definition of african-american. (no matter what alan keyes may say.)
:p""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

- the use of capitalization in ""not white"" emphasizes disagreement
- the question ""where do you get 'white?'"" appears challenging
- the detailed explanation about obama's heritage seems informative
- the tongue-out emoticon "":p"" at the end indicates playfulness

step 2: true intention

- the seemingly confrontational opening is softened by the detailed, factual explanation
- the obama example is used to illustrate a point, not to mock
- the parenthetical mention of alan keyes and the emoticon suggest the commenter is aware of the complexity and potential controversy of the topic

step 3: comparison and analysis

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the first sentence appears to be giving advice about labeling clothing. the second part seems to be expressing frustration about needing to repeat information about gay parents having children.

step 2 (true intention):
the first sentence is actually a mocking suggestion implying the addressee is ignorant or has their ""head up their ass."" the second part uses exaggerated capitalization and repetition to emphasize a point, suggesting frustration with having to repeatedly state what the speaker considers obvious.
