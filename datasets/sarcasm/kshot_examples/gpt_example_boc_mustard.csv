Cues:
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of irony is evident in leonard’s statement. he describes a negative experience (""said horrible things about each other in public"") followed by an excessively positive phrase (""a pretty magical night""), which creates a clear contrast and implies that he does not literally mean the night was magical.

- **cultural background:** the culture of sarcasm in language often involves stating something positive about a negative experience to highlight the contrast and indicate the opposite of what is being said.
- **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the negative action of saying ""horrible things about each other"" and the positive description ""a pretty magical night"" signals sarcasm. the emotional weight of ""horrible things"" clashing with ""magical night"" amplifies this.
- **context:** in the earlier part, leonard rightly describes mundane, pleasant activities. the following statement about ""horrible things"" and “magical night” directly contrasts with the earlier tone, indicating he doesn’t actually believe the night was magical but is speaking ironically.
