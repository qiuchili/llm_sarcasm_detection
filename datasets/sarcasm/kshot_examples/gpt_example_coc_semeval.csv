Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

@tyquorshaaa: jackie just had the best joke i've heard in awhile | :face_with_tears_of_joy::weary_face::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

those were some great last minute substitutions @tomcrean

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**

- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is sharply contrasted by the actual content (which implies annoyance or discomfort), indicating sarcasm.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony

""oh look at me! i'm making people happy! i'm a magical man from happy land! who lives in a gumdrop house on lolly pop lane!""

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

#sorry  #sorry i always do this... #cant #help #it #im #an #asshole #like #that http://t.co/zp4jibpsbj

Steps:
**step 1: examine the surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""sorry,"" ""always do this,"" ""can't help it,"" ""i'm an asshole""
- hashtags: repeat usage of ""sorry"" shows apology or regret.
- sentiment phrases: the tweet contains self-deprecating phrases like ""i'm an asshole.""
- overall, the surface sentiment appears to express regret and self-blame.

**step 2: determine the true intention**
- language style: the double use of ""sorry"" and phrases that are self-reflective indicate genuine regret rather than ironic humor.
- absence of hyperbole or extreme contrast between statements that usually signifies sarcasm. 
- the tone seems consistent in conveying remorse.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of regret aligns with the true intention. there's no contradictory element or exaggerated contrast that would indicate sarcasm.
- given that both the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning point toward genuine regret, the tweet is likely not sarcastic.
