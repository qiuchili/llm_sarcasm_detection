0,"Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

1,"Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

1,"Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:

1,"Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

1,"Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

1,"Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

1,"Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

1,"Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

1,"Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.
