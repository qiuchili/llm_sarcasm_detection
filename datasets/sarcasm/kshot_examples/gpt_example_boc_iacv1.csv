after. christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent. it arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century. from one follower of a 7th day adventist prophetess came ""flood geology"" in the early 20th century. later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the u.s. in the 1960s, there arose more modern ""creation science."" it began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th day adventists as the base. creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of job and jonah, are literally true. creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the bible. when creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur, they decided that god had created original ""kinds"" and then allow hyper evolution after that. creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind.
