1,"Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

1,"Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm

1,"Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

1,"Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label:

1,"Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

Label:

1,"Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

1,"Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.
