i don't know if you've heard about it newspapers it's a sort of paper based reader,1
every village in africa now has a cyber cafe,1
it has empowered you it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well,1
vietnam,1
so by now there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the vietnamese police,1
for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store to steal it,1
this is your life enjoy it,1
they were used first by a danish newspaper which wanted to make a point on islam,0
you know the story,0
i was there to report on that story in cartoons,0
we brought together cartoonists from all sides in ivory coast,0
in lebanon it was not a book,0
and we did video clips you can see them if you go to,0
today tech companies are the world's largest editors,0
now at this point about nanoseconds in the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong,1
i started with money,0
you can look at how much electricity they need because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers and is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have,0
i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist,1
and then this is like projects that are harder to build,1
the bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground,0
and then there was a second level to this object which is that it i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion to each other,0
now in fairness if you've spent any time at all in washington you know this is really a radical concept for the government,1
that's why i began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the united states for so called second tier terrorists,0
by that point i basically had a master's degree in escape attempts,1
and when i entered into colombian politics i thought i'd be able to withstand any temperature,0
in fact the planets and moons you see here could host life all of them and we know that and it's a strong possibility,0
something that in many ways i wish no one would ever know but here i feel kind of obliged to reveal,1
i in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top possible,1
i never practiced law a day in my life i pretty much wasn't allowed to,1
i'm an american i don't believe in philosophy,1
training ground for great economic thinkers like george soros and friedrich hayek and mick jagger,1
it's a huge trademark violation but it's pretty clever,1
this is called the candle problem,0
doesn't work,0
he gathered his participants and said i'm going to time you how quickly you can solve this problem,0
but that's not happening here,0
this is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored,0
let me show you,0
you want to be looking around,0
so what really matters are the more right brained creative conceptual kinds of abilities,0
everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem,0
we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say you're crazy don't do that you're going kill the guy,1
so we did a second parabola,1
and we did a fourth and a fifth and a sixth,1
we have something called the genome individuals we're sequencing as part of that,0
and what he said for me was very moving,0
we set up a whole er,0
but hey at least it's,1
and he said oh yeah i remember that too i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me,1
and nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons,1
this is sort of the munch of the penguins,1
this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how big i am or you know my what big teeth you have,1
and she did this over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head,1
he mounted a camera on the tail,0
shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels,0
but i turned away for a moment and he got caught into a and started to be pulled out towards the jetty,0
we got back on shore he was fine,0
and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them,0
the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale,0
it was with the elephants that this story pivoted,0
and while these are both wonderful things in their own right they both have very wonderful things going for them truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date,1
in fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here chris really quite sparse,1
so no matter how lazy you feel you're not really intrinsically doing nothing,1
truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences,0
so we have an opportunity to really open up education,0
and these micro machines power how a cell moves,0
back in the and when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy really not quite clear what we were supposed to be,1
we're told what shape we're supposed to be in,1
and on top of all off these rules they keep changing,1
and i just ate it up,0
we have amazing antennae,0
and i think i truly believe that we can change this thing one laugh at a time,0
members of the african national congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi,1
without you i'm just a guy talking to an empty room and i spent a lot of time last week doing that and it's not the same as this,1
the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said solly you are pathologically helpful,1
welcome i love you,1
don't go in there,1
it's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that,1
but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about,1
i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called game reserve,0
i am because of you,0
the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks,0
as it bites the second time i kick,0
i make an instant decision that i'll never look at that again,0
i'm still in a vulnerable position,0
he wraps it around my leg picks me up a second time walks me to a vehicle and he's able to get me to medical attention,0
pain is shared,0
and i could list more,1
happy novelties,0
that's silly,0
and this is a rare action shot ladies and gentlemen,1
as you might guess this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers,1
now i'm guessing that this sounds terrifying,1
partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them,1
that was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which,0
that's because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology genetics,0
many of you have probably heard about so i'll just say briefly that is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely easily and quickly,0
crying about corals is having a moment guys,1
the northern great barrier reef lost two thirds of its corals last year over a distance of hundreds of miles then bleached again this year and the bleaching stretched further south,0
here's another couple,1
but before i do that let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible,0
in fact you can see the existential sadness in their eyes,1
if you want to remember one thing it's that you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead,1
repeat it to yourself three times a day,1
i arranged for his plane to be delayed,1
this is clearly following my wife's values which is happy wife happy life,1
and the robot sees the cat,1
and i think this could be as some people have described it the biggest event in human history,0
the second law is a law of humility if you like,0
well i don't really know what wrong is but i know that i don't want to do it,0
you are better off with a machine that's designed in this way than without it,0
there's all kinds of things you don't want the robot doing,0
the real difficulties in fact are us,0
so it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness and it can even understand that your nastiness for example you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school,0
so to understand his behavior we actually have to invert through a model of human cognition that includes our computational limitations a very complicated model,0
in fact i saw some young adults playing this sport down the street from my house the other day and as far as i know there have been no reported concussions,1
that was the subject of the will smith movie concussion,0
i'm cutting my hair it's getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it and that was kind of what was going on,1
i haven't got any qualifications,0
you have to have the right attitude to agree to do it,1
i guarantee you that will never happen again,1
i'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments,0
when an area of the brain is active meaning a neural area is active it gets blood flow shunted to that area,0
it must have been a very unusual day for him,1
it was not very comfortable,1
and the way to it for me was through artistic means,0
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them,0
it did tell me that this maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though,1
and i think this is what we've done with climate change,0
we didn't wait any prerequisite amount of time for our courtship we told each other the vulnerable truths up front i am a man which means the f on my birth certificate should have stood for false instead of female,1
and in those messages between us we collapsed time we it we laid it all on the table,1
but kim said that i was her ideal the heartbroken mess that i was,1
i often kind of sum up the differences in our strengths by saying keep me safe and i'll keep you wild,1
so sprinting towards her hand in marriage was the thing that i could do,1
i love him whole pre transition now and in the future,0
i wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet,1
now not so much,1
when i was nine i saw the movie jaws and thought to myself no thank you,1
i was going to be the garbage man,1
and that's hard to do if you don't know who you are,0
i said i'd like to be a writer,0
so broken bled the blues and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing,0
outside we'd have to rehearse running away or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there,0
he tried to kill himself in grade when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him get over it,0
because maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique,0
we stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called,0
red,1
so this incident that i'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea,0
and you control their thinking not like this although that would be cool,1
it's hard for me to admit to you because i'm a pricing consultant,1
it's true if you're a business owner if you're an employee if you're a job seeker,0
in my work i've often heard women express that they're uncomfortable communicating their value especially early on in business ownership,0
to which you have to say that's true but i think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast,1
my favorite of the letters that i got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy medication she had tried pretty much everything and she had found a solution and hoped i would tell the world and that was making little things from yarn,1
instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them,1
and i said the fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news,1
and maggie robbins said i used to volunteer in an aids clinic and i would just talk and talk and talk and the people i was dealing with weren't very responsive and i thought not very friendly or helpful of them,1
in i had a series of losses,0
and finally after four full hours of my lying and staring at it the phone rang and somehow i managed to pick it up and it was my father and i said i'm in serious trouble,0
the first is that i knew that objectively speaking i had a nice life and that if i could only get well there was something at the other end that was worth living for,0
i hope that years hence people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science,0
if you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel terrible and six months later you can barely function at all then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances,0
it's easier to help who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be but it's difficult with because we believe we are seeing the truth,0
things are different because now i know that depression is the family secret that everyone has,0
they blew up,1
when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife,1
here in this box i have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitoes,1
we kill them,1
one of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease,0
and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae put it on pieces of cloth and then did something very remarkable,0
have a look,0
couples like this one and this one and this one and yes even this one,1
the first thing i did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery probably looking for the one who did this to me,1
it will keep me for example from making an undignified departure from the stage,1
this will take a while,1
okay anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own,1
so and the feedback for the p,1
you do not know the power of the dark side,1
you'd all make great blind people,1
i call this process flash sonar,0
and that's one of the reasons why i think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon,1
but let's say for a moment that you were,1
there is even most beautifully of all a report this item button,1
it's the user reviews,1
i would too if i were you,1
hundreds of people send their into one address they're tumbled and jumbled up and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients but they're different micro laundering systems,1
you can even buy some advertising space,1
one vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine,1
they even promised to reinvest percent of any profits into local education programs,1
was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price,0
and by my reckoning that is not a good thing,0
you don't pay with your credit card of course that would lead directly back to you,0
brilliant elegant,0
and i think things like the dark net markets creative secure difficult to censor i think that's the future,0
there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate sometimes even mundane,0
another called twister and so on and so on,0
has started a dark net site,0
it's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity,0
encouraging yes,1
so you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter,1
it's kind of a magic place the mountain,0
there'll be a satellite called tess that will discover planets outside of our solar system,0
the big discoveries are all behind us,1
then the internet revolution brought us computing power data networks unprecedented access to information and communication and our lives have never been the same,0
she said everything is fine but once i spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word for him,1
the poor woman tried to translate this for him from them i extended my hands and stole you and here's the pickle and because you belong to them i returned my hands and left you,1
he replied don't you know what they call it i do,0
in fact it looked like the appian way marble salesman showed up with his sample book showed it to hadrian and hadrian said we'll take all of it,1
for the first time i realized people were smart years ago,1
he was one of the new york school abstract who together with his contemporaries invented american modern art and contributed to moving the american zeitgeist towards modernism in the century,0
i followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy,0
it was terribly dangerous,1
i'm going to tell you about that technology,0
so back in november during the election last year the only image that we could publish was this which was on the stand on the week that everybody voted,1
and in the library i found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the great depression,0
and i'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists,1
i literally grew up with the ford motor company,0
and the good news this one's a monster,1
there are many science based analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we're living beyond our means,0
they got two times as much money when they passed go they collected twice the salary and they got to roll both dice instead of one so they got to move around the board a lot more,1
i have three,1
i'm pretty much untouchable at this point,1
and when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly,1
in surveys we've found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good and that the pursuit of self interest is favorable and moral,0
participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor,0
but over the last years that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else,0
there's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse,0
but in fact we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions small changes to people's values small nudges in certain directions can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy,0
my children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other,1
now i was growing up in the late and early and there were a number of other passions i was also interested in but these two were the ones that differentiated me,1
and i mean books everywhere around the house,0
that actually for a given body mass of a primate the metabolic rate was static,0
that's what i have behind myself,1
but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas,1
it's almost like leaving congress,1
but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth they don't unless if you're a lawyer,1
and all we've got is a,1
and here's his second bit of advice,0
if you look at the federal budget this is what it looks like,0
and unless you want this person to not just become the of florida but the united states we'd better deal with this stuff,0
and let me recap some of the stuff you've seen,0
but now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering let me show you what's happened in that period of time,0
but instead of a bellows i had a leaf blower,1
but this is it,1
and the situation it describes is the hero of the book he's a century man finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people,0
so i thought okay i'll start with five,0
all this noise around us actually has information,0
in and early i wrote about columns with the following theme don't worry donald trump will never be the republican nominee,1
i do think he's a moral freak and i think he'll be undone by that fact the fact that he just doesn't know anything about anything and is about it,1
and failing,1
america i am sorry,1
it didn't just happen overnight,0
and he would say yes it is gretchen,0
and so human dignity whether it would be the dust up about the disabled reporter or what happened in that audiotape with billy bush and the way in which he spoke about women they put that aside and pretended as if they hadn't seen that or heard that because to them policies were more important,0
they see a man of action,0
it was democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality republicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom,0
but let's come back to it,1
i want the happy ending implied by the title to my article which is incidentally the only part of the article that i didn't actually write,1
so my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship,0
they've used it between members of the police and members of community and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies,0
it's not like plato woke up one day and then he wrote hello i'm plato and as of today i have a fully introspective consciousness,1
i don't count those little packages of noodles as food,1
each dot represents a teacher,1
this is roger ailes,1
when they're secret important and destructive i've coined a term for these algorithms weapons of math destruction,1
it gets worse,0
but i was quickly told that boy our government doesn't really work like that,1
hopefully very soon we will be there because we are destined obsessed with making it real,0
i mean check out that form,1
standing there that night i take a deep breath and look at and tell him i have never been more proud of you than i am in this moment,0
i'm not going to talk about that tonight,1
it's plastics,1
so had the graduate heard the right one word maybe he would have ended up onstage oh i don't know maybe with these two,1
but in today's world sex plus pill equals no baby,1
this is unnatural selection,1
but if you take one of the you see in the herms bags on fifth avenue and you let it loose on the african plain you can watch natural selection happen,1
and he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on each hand which turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher,1
and some in washington have a lot more of it,1
and as you're thinking about this incredible ability to make life do what you want it to do what it's programmed to do what you end up doing is taking what we've been doing for thousands of years which is breeding changing mixing matching all kinds of life forms and we accelerate it,0
and as you're thinking of other things we've been doing think about twins,0
it turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses of changing plants of changing animals perhaps even of evolving ourselves,0
she played two varsity sports,0
and their kids will be saved and their grandchildren will be saved and this passes on,0
when we put vaccines into people we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit outweighs the risk,0
it's the same with a city it's the same with a suburb,0
it really is a way of programming stuff and there's nothing that's going to change us more than this,0
it didn't happen at random,0
so there's the scientific method but what's really going on is this,1
so what was the difference well the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience i,1
i have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of marie curie because i am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect,1
indeed there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer,1
where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing,1
so i thought well maybe i should teach a course on ignorance something i can finally excel at perhaps for example,0
the ignorant are clearly unenlightened unaware uninformed and present company today excepted often occupy elected offices it seems to me,0
we all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts this accumulation model of science as many have called it and it seems impregnable it seems impossible,0
i have to get out of here actually,0
that's true,0
so the knowledge generates ignorance,0
two half years in the making,1
this is my poor son patrick,1
even though it's earth like and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored earth like life it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse that's an degrees fahrenheit surface because of rampant carbon dioxide,0
the sun increases in its intensity in its brightness and finally at about billion years after it first started the earth is consumed by a large sun and this is what's left,0
i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough that would guide me through the minutes,1
i studied cooking in school for four years and in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification,1
anyway,1
can you imagine a car on a stick,1
it doesn't pass any standards,1
sorry,1
overtime is the passion of design so join the club or don't,1
a copper jelly mold,1
i'm not interested at all in or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design,0
and we should be developing things we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use,0
a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn thom mayne hadid rem koolhaas all these people that i think are and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form,0
we look at how that is produced,0
this is the final product,0
it's mass individualism from a single product,0
these new ideas for materials will come into play in probably a decade,0
this is the freaky side coming out,0
i'm also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all,0
he's incredibly fast at it too faster than i am in fact,1
great idea but it doesn't work at all,0
i said what is that dad a job,1
you know the one,1
there's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather,1
if al gore is here i'm going to send my fourth graders from agnor hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week,1
it reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes,0
chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker who's made a film,0
and they weren't flashing in anger they were flashing in love intense love for her students,0
wow some century,1
i think that's good luck,1
you're not even going to be able to answer her questions,1
and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didn't because i guess i have a high tolerance for pain,1
oh let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit,0
so we got this voice on this train concourse one omaha lincoln,0
well some of you are laughing,0
so i'm going to talk to the baby,0
right so a bit of trivia about that era for you,1
i think i have candies in my purse older than years old,1
right so next subject is a young woman next subject class is a young woman called bella a university student interviewed in during what was called an intro to feminist porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the bay area,1
right class,1
that's right,1
yeah and i totally believe in causes yeah like all that stuff,1
i'm marrying a woman,1
wharton,1
you know you don't watch bourne identity and go drive your car over a gondola in venice,1
yes macy all right,0
remember these early modules in these people's full identities were protected and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic which for many of them was taboo,0
yes oh the cold is for the machines the new technology,0
lots of tenderness you understand,0
well first of all i was just trying to find you know couples normal couples making love but this so many people together at one time,0
that's how they market me,0
perfect,0
no my one sister virginia gave me a for the coach to dublin and that's how i ended up here,0
well for your record my opinion of the legalization i'd say i'm against it,0
or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom,1
and my brother says i got the top grade in the class,1
she didn't even have a boyfriend,1
the numbers tell the story quite clearly,0
now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women,0
i don't have the right answer,0
actually one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school,1
we got a flood of donations mostly checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then we got a money transfer for really nice guy,1
so here is bill of arabia,1
she lives with her parents her two brothers and her great aunt,0
she went to high school,0
it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education,0
in the century it was slavery,0
my dog is a black lab and i drive a honda odyssey minivan,1
i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age,0
i don't need a husband who wants to be,1
they were lifted verbatim from own remarks,1
now the daily show with john stewart is by far the most it's by far the most well documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy,1
i have some material about the so called radical gay agenda which starts off by asking how radical is the gay agenda because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military get married and start a family,1
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language,0
which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self interest,0
it just so happens that stewart's brand of funny doesn't work unless the facts are true,0
and not long after that he got another request for a copy from the head of the in california who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in sacramento last year,0
they look somewhat similar but they mean very different things,1
so the best way to demonstrate how this technology works is to try a live demo so i need a volunteer preferably somebody with a face,1
yep awesome,1
try to remember what it was like when left one direction,1
between men and women,1
in emotion science we call each facial muscle movement an action unit,0
and then eyebrow raised indicator of surprise,0
but we call each reading an emotion data point and then they can fire together to portray different emotions,0
the more people who know about this technology the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used,0
what you can see here is the german age pyramid and there the small black point at the top that's me,1
this is a more sophisticated version of it depends,1
highly speculative,0
now to close the gap germany has to significantly increase migration get many more women in the workforce increase retirement age by the way we just lowered it this year and all these measures at once,0
a squirrel is chewing on your internet,1
it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on,1
we've only communicated via this system which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet,1
and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but he'd let me know when and so with about four days notice he said to go to this beach south of lisbon and a little after this guy will walk out of the water,1
and then once it was in the right place he got back in the water holding a big knife and he cut each buoy off and the buoy popped up into the air and the cable dropped to the sea floor and he did that all the way out to the ship and when he got there they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie and then he jumped back in and he swam back to shore and then he lit a cigarette,1
you can experience their sense of place,0
if you went and looked for images of the internet this was all that you found this famous image by of the internet as the kind of milky way this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it,0
and i was embarrassed,0
and that connection is an unequivocally physical process,0
if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village it's because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this,0
i got a little bit excited that day as you can see,1
and there's a name for people like global citizens,0
ladies and gentlemen,1
and you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world,0
let's call him nick because that's his name,1
so it's great good job but not really that interesting definitely not,1
but i still have six and a half minutes,1
he said well we have the bing searches,1
they studied it very carefully skeptically they approved it,0
think things should go ok,0
and these reports are pretty simple it has all the diseases that the patient has all the drugs that they're on and all the adverse events or side effects that they experience,0
russ he said i've created a that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not,0
it's a pretty common one so when so few hands go up either you're not paying attention or you don't know your blood type and both of those are bad,1
and i didn't know that either until i took these courses in college but back then and this was in let's just call it the people didn't know much about why our cells are coated with sugar,0
it's the money shot,1
and the satellite imagery we have of it today is old,0
if you come back the next day and all the money is just gone you really need to dump that guy,1
this is not the type of consent like with an terms of service where you just scroll to the bottom and you're like agree agree whatever,1
and in a lot of states you're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim,1
and i totally get it there are serious legal risks and of course that potential for privacy violations,0
does this sound familiar it's exactly what we're worrying about now with social media and drone cameras and of course,0
he tells her i'd like to hand paint your portrait on a coffee mug,1
i'm a monkey blowing kisses at a butterfly,1
the start of the story where this means guy and that is a ponytail on a passer by,0
i got a pencil you can borrow,0
my classmate got an arsonist for her first client,1
we're talking about percent of the population or percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their first,1
work happened later marriage happened later kids happened later even death happened later,0
awesome twentysomethings really matter,0
it's a tough market out there,1
that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about,1
so we're in the forecasting business,0
but the difference of a few years on stock market valuations is obviously extreme,0
i spent hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten,1
so let's consider an example of this that's completely theoretical,0
ok now if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this,1
i'm going to guide you into the car,1
nicole and actually here's the thing answer it answer it answer it,1
ok a little bit closer,1
a voodoo experiment,1
and only when you feel the pressure go back allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop but only when you feel the pressure,1
she's not taking any chances,1
think of that guy that that guy,1
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side,1
i was going to use you but i decided i might want to come back another year,1
there you are ok,1
ok and tell me when you're done,1
so all right we'll leave them like that,1
my hand is at risk here,1
no good decision,1
but if you were to guess,1
i want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody,0
why is that ok swap them around put your right hand up,0
ok but don't say my name like that,0
i'm so afraid of what i'm going to see,0
god,0
there's a wall there's a wall,0
i'm looking at the road all the time,0
but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception the solutions you come up with will percent of the time be way off the mark,0
things that go bump in the night nicole no,0
twice,0
ok take a seat,0
that's it all the way down all the way down,0
ok,0
come right over here next to me,0
excellent,0
now you don't know where the spike is and i don't know where it is either,0
now i'm going to put on the blindfold,0
tell me when i'm over a cup,0
and so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack,1
and believe it or not they went for it,1
and yeah,1
so i'd like to end on sort of a wacky note,1
the body flexes backwards just a spectacular movement,0
and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system,0
and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract and a latch that prevents anything from moving,0
and those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of flexible structure,0
so it's very well known to engineers not as well known to biologists,0
and one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points,0
i'm here today to talk about autonomous flying beach balls,1
they're not even autonomous,0
as a multi purpose passenger vehicle it is now officially designed for occasional off road use,1
so instead of trying to make a car that can fly we decided to try to make a plane that could drive,0
we haven't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out,1
so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago but more importantly it was featured on miami so you really know it's true,1
on the other hand when we do tours of our lab at the institute and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop it turns out that not everyone wants to know,1
what we need to do though is we need to develop a kind of microbial where we don't just know where we are currently but also where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it,1
and imagine if through new scientific advances we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves,0
each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community,0
and we've just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another,0
it is not,1
although some days she's also a which is a choice that i can respect,1
they probably should have marketed this as some of the guardians of the galaxy,1
but when i talk about my daughter the word i find myself saying most is athlete,0
they control the conversation,0
i mean just take a look at some of the titles of self help books awaken the giant within practicing the power of now or here's a great one we can all relate to you are a how to stop doubting your greatness and start living an awesome life,1
if you're like most people when you hear the words our organization is going to start a transformation you're thinking uh oh,1
you know frankly i'm not that good but i do have one distinct capability i am remarkably fast at finding my bike,1
or given the urgency what they'll do is they'll just focus on the short term results but that doesn't give any hope for the future,0
you would never know until she told you,1
now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes,0
this is mountains out of a timeline of global media panic,1
these little green peaks are asteroid collisions,1
so in order to really create a full image i had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me which was very very annoying and uncomfortable,1
so essentially we had our first carbon neutral volcano,1
this is the billion dollar o gram and this image arose out of frustration i had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press,0
you can literally see them,0
and it mushroomed slightly,0
as you can see there's a kind of odd regular pattern in the data twin peaks every year,0
the masses move again not according to newton's laws but because they see this space time curvature and follow the little curves just like when our nestles up to us because of the mattress curvature,1
we want to measure longitudes distances,0
both are fairly bad for your health,1
very good,1
on one occasion i was doing it every time i did a point that they didn't like they actually threw stones at me and when i did a point they liked they starting shooting in the air equally not great,1
so if you have a traditional perception of terrorism it would be that it's one of criminality one of war,0
it's a load of nonsense,0
there's two essential ways of doing that if we carry on this brand theme,0
you could be looking there at poverty injustice all those sorts of things which feed terrorism,0
so i'm smiling,1
the materials that allowed the battery operated facial expressions is a material that we call and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen,0
if you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them they repair themselves they go zip and they repair the hole in which is not is really quick,1
but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse,0
it's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here,1
it doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment,0
ladies and gentlemen that was in in the united states and i wish i had,1
men don't talk,1
i've been doing this for years,0
between and domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by percent and that is great news,0
we can flip lorries coaches buses anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power,1
i've been a professional stunt man for years,0
and of course everybody wants their own tower,1
maybe many of you have had this experience,0
so next time you are at a dinner party you might want to reach for this possibly neutral drink,1
but by the time we turn we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult born neurons,0
just shout it out,1
you should have started with z,1
it also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is red bull and bacon,1
and so i'm watching him and he slows down and finally he stops,0
it's more mundane,0
they're also able to reason at high levels,0
i want to see what happens with those words,0
actually oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states which may be a good thing or a bad thing but it makes you glad they're driving less,1
yet all of these innovations that's what they said in the brochure,1
short talk,1
i take some solace from winston churchill who put it this way the americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives,1
and there's an alternative,0
since then we've doubled the number of roads in america and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation,0
the health argument is a scary one and you've probably heard part of this argument before,0
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are,1
the supreme court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another so it's not just big brother we have to worry about but big neighbor,1
they go on to jam innocent receivers for miles around you,1
here's ramon looking for a little attention from dad that week,1
here you are,1
it's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us,0
well these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago but things have changed,0
four months later i was back up on a snowboard although things didn't go quite as expected my knees and my ankles wouldn't bend and at one point i traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when i fell and my legs still attached to my snowboard went flying down the mountain and i was on top of the mountain still,1
with this job all i needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and i could go anywhere,0
hence the mars watch,1
this is david oh one of our flight directors and he's at the beach in los angeles with his family at in the morning,1
and one of the things that we all discovered is you can get anywhere in los angeles at in the morning when there's no traffic,1
so those of us who were on mars time would refer to ourselves as martians and everyone else as earthlings,1
so before we send people we send robots,0
so we have to think as if we are actually on mars with the,0
and that was because again this eventually becomes hard on your body,0
what it means in terms of the distances between them how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time,0
so the next time you think you don't have enough time in your day just remember it's all a matter of your earthly perspective,0
and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision its playfulness its innovation and its promise of imminent violence,1
and unlike the juicy it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain rather it simply attaches itself to your brain,1
when it was uncovered it ushered in a new era of streamlined futuristic design called which came to be synonymous with the jet age a misnomer,0
you can take it home with you unlike the theme building which will stay where it is forever,0
and it's important to note that they're to scale so if you stand feet back and you can read between those two black lines you have vision,1
just go with me,1
you're going to remember that fact for like years,1
that's a day and i have them all,1
but there is one thing i know how to do i know how to program a computer,0
really simple idea you take every academy award best picture you speed it up to one minute each and string them all together,0
and so i this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be in that manner which is spears,0
i was there too with a film crew,0
this is the so called lansdowne portrait,0
and last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before except for if you're sitting next to someone,1
in closing and as we're moving towards the end i just also want to encourage and i'm willing to share my failures as well though not from the stage,1
and third is that physical things are readable on a map so restaurants a variety of venues but also with and other technology like and it continues to expand beyond that we can also track things that are moving like a car a taxicab a transit system a box that's moving through time and space,0
they did not invent car sharing,0
and at every day it doesn't matter who you're emailing or what you're doing the desks rise to the ceiling,1
this person will never see the email you just sent,1
it doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food but businesspeople will use their own products to demonstrate that they feel that they're confident in them,0
at the end of the call the journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball,0
what's really interesting about the school is that percent of the kids who go there have parents who are high level silicon valley tech execs,0
or even more powerful in film morgan freeman,1
so when you're watching a movie and a phone rings it's not actually ringing,0
he was always singing and making jokes and his daughters and sons saved me from his bull who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor,1
i remember how we got delayed on uncle house when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop were eating the sand bags that hold the lifts,1
and you keep going all the way to the top,1
they say they are the ones who produce the garbage not them,1
the art piece at some point will disappear vanish and actually there is somebody who is building a second floor in front of uncle house so it's covering part of the painting so i might need to go back and paint over it,1
this event killed their livelihood,0
from outside it looks chaotic but everything is perfectly organized,0
he was the key of the project,0
it was really important for me that the community felt connected to the words,0
actually they live in the garbage,0
if you want to see the real image of somebody maybe you should change your angle,0
you don't like it shake it and you have a lesbian couple,1
i remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became,1
it's a little quirky and silly,0
you can draw as everyone should,0
it's a children's book about indian independence very patriotic,0
they're not very well designed,1
today i'm going to show you four because i hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this still,1
and that's ok right a lot of people are very happy with,0
there's nothing you can do,0
and it's going to be more important than the social layer and affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more,0
i enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy in which people i was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what i was encouraged to call exercises with women i was encouraged to call surrogates who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else,1
i've sometimes wondered whether i could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay technicolor fiesta of which this speech is one manifestation,1
a friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself once suggested that we organize gay humility week,1
you're four,1
my last book was about how families manage to deal with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring,0
and that day my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae,0
and i graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria where i would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls,0
building identity is about changing the world,0
she had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity,0
now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration,1
now this is a consequence of play deprivation,1
but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow wagging her tail,0
the standards have changed such that as says the typical road to a subdivision in america allows you to see the curvature of the earth,1
and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena so,1
you need to do all four of these things simultaneously and that's the structure of my talk today to take you through each of those,0
it's so easy to understand the places where you only live the places where you only work the places where you only shop and our super sized public institutions,0
every night on the tv news now is like a nature hike through the book of revelation,1
turns out it makes a difference if it's cheaper than,1
and she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request,1
that right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized,0
and the accumulated amount of man made global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every hours days a year,0
the white represents normal temperature days are arbitrarily chosen,0
so we're having record breaking temperatures,0
and the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths deep mid ocean the first few hundred meters,0
last year we did a dance in zero gravity and once we set up an obstacle course out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert and then played them by stunt driving a car through them,1
and i think the big contributing factor may have been that this is how i decorated my high school bedroom,1
so i was in this visual maelstrom just pretty much usually sitting in one place and i guess just the overload in general my brain kind of tried to make sense of it and i would if i could move my head off to one side a little bit the edge of the desk would line up just perfectly with that poster on the opposite wall or if i put my thumb out i could close first my left eye and then my right and my thumb would bounce back and forth between jimi left eye and his right,1
and what i'm trying to do is get that back there to stick out of her head like a ponytail,1
which is one ten thousandth of one percent so your chance for success is literally one in a million,1
we try to find a sandbox and then we gamble a whole bunch of our resources on getting in that sandbox and playing,1
it was like my was lines long and columns wide which i presume that if anybody is going to understand that it's this crowd,1
and when it does click it doesn't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece it feels like you found it like it was a set of relationships that you unlocked,0
and then with that plan in mind you go back and double check your original idea and maybe revise it and then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan the plan and the idea eventually you come up with a truly great plan,0
that was things that we had to have go according to our plan,0
sixty eight percent of mothers with high feelings of entitlement and self esteem identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for purina,1
i'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway are hideous,1
a few days later the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in washington,0
because think about the teddy bear,0
i also need alcohol and morphine because it's the only way i can work,1
according to his biographer he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world,1
if that belief turns out to be mistaken it will make a difference,1
this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do,1
and in fact there's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people,1
as my wife put it you've washed away the clooney,1
she reaches into her purse and hands him a,1
but what i want to point out is you can buy this from,1
he went through europe through world war stealing extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection,0
and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van,0
in particular the supper at emmaus which was viewed as finest masterpiece his best work people would come from all over the world to see it was actually a forgery,0
many sociologists like and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs because we're focused on status,0
so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden,0
few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human,0
they believe mcdonald's food is tastier and it leads them to experience it as tastier,0
everybody of course drinks exactly the same wine,0
in fact they're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form,1
we had never seen our planet from this perspective before,0
so basically china is a sick bric country,1
central cat and local cats,1
there is not only in china but also in the united states there are some very small cute but bad cats,1
in the north there was a great wall chang cheng,0
but if you think the is something like a wasteland i think it's wrong,0
so even though china's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet society is really booming,0
my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects including a remote controlled garbage can,1
the first stage was completed at home which consisted of the chicken grilling the chicken amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab,0
and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better,1
so i couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly,1
and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research,1
but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about,1
and i call this my year of speaking dangerously,1
just stop it,1
and i always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that were pretty excellent just as they were,0
a third to a half of the population are a third to a half,0
is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation,0
so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when i was going to school we sat in rows,0
this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of in them,0
now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and case in point is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe,0
i bought a fast car,1
i couldn't care less if clients ever called,1
reaching success i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas,0
and i got distracted by it,0
this photo taken just before his death is actually a no one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this and if they did they would not live to tell it because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator,1
i'll tell you when you can turn back,1
let me give you just some examples of how some powerful examples of how this has been used historically,0
these are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like,0
interestingly what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio moral issues in the sexual domain,0
let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted,0
and what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative,0
in the case of disgust what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence,0
on average it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret,1
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men stay with me so that you can't hear the song and then i'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen and we can all sail by unaffected,0
and please raise your hand if you've ever used tinder to help you find a mate,1
but it turns out that the key social identifier is how much you're going to talk in the car,1
i distinctly remember telling my dad that i wanted to buy a navy blue secondhand peugeot on and he rightfully pointed out that the seller's name was invisible wizard and that this probably was not such a good idea,1
you got it ok,0
there are in fact hundreds of definitions of trust and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment of how likely it is that things will go right,0
our behaviors transform often relatively quickly,0
i am constantly stunned by major breaches of trust the news corp phone hacking the volkswagen emissions scandal the widespread abuse in the catholic church the fact that only one measly banker went to jail after the great financial crisis or more recently the panama papers that revealed how the rich can exploit offshore tax regimes,0
is the country gonna make it will democracy flourish what scares you most what scares me most is is you lack of your engagement,1
the question now however is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation,0
well i don't know what you're thinking but i'm talking about the beards,1
i made a few changes let go of some loose trappings of my old life and through a bit of a leap of logic decided to row across the atlantic ocean,1
we have a bit of a thing going on,0
i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do,0
in fact the words wrong number were more popular than the word hello,1
and the second goat says no the book was better,1
and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine long live,1
all the others have been all those three,1
the americans have even recognized it in an agreement,0
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic joseph nye a friend of mine,0
so soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments but partly despite governments,0
in order to have soft power you have to be connected,0
he had written vague but exciting in pencil in the corner,1
but months later this is how innovation happens months later my boss said i could do it on the side as a sort of a play project kick the tires of a new computer we'd got,0
sorry about this jeff,1
should've been a dancer,1
don't worry,1
or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth,1
next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder it might be bono,1
and the look on my face is the feeling that i've been searching for ever since,0
music yeah,0
and after years of searching i found a prototype,0
i haven't come to the best part,1
there are a lot of stories about why we did this,0
the remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit maximizing capitalists,1
this is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort,1
we are the saudi arabia of barrels,1
on the competitiveness front we all know that toyota has more market cap than the big three put together,0
the point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient,0
and one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil,0
because he's an open mouth sleeper he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease and so i asked him how often he and he said every other day,1
i think he was drunk,1
not long after she left her job to study photography in maine and while she was there she ended up meeting the director of photography at the new york times magazine and was actually offered a job,0
he was there alone drinking and she was with friends,0
at the end of the day after we left sun city i told alec that i didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting,0
they gave it back to the wise old woman,1
and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret,1
and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another,1
brotherly tempers started to get strained,0
we're all one family,0
as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question,0
you could also use the face network to hallucinate into this and you get some pretty crazy stuff,1
and the poetry is you know i think kind of not bad actually,1
the flip side of perception is creativity turning a concept into something out there into the world,0
because unlike say the heart or the intestines you really can't say very much about a brain by just looking at it at least with the naked eye,0
and these structures these cells that have these these branches that can go very very long distances this was very novel at the time,0
but i'm also pro arithmetic,1
yet,1
it's my house with a ferrari out front,1
some people call it a lifestyle change,1
to get lightbulbs per person you'd need a land area something like three and a half worth either in our country or in someone else's country possibly ireland possibly somewhere else,1
the total area of those is two greater london's worth of someone else's sahara and you'll need power lines all the way across spain and france to bring the power from the sahara to surrey,1
the length of the road doesn't matter because the longer the road the more plantation,0
and it might make you think perhaps there's an issue to do with areas,0
it's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well,0
top left we have canada and australia with enormous land areas very high per capita consumption or lightbulbs per person and very low population densities,0
or my favorite the love you mean it,1
what this is doing is we find a a direct collision we find a direct collision between availability and what's possible through availability and a fundamental human need which we've been hearing about a lot actually the need to create shared narratives,1
there's a significant delta in fact between what we're willing to accept,0
the stories that we tell what we push out becomes who we are,0
so they're smart but poor,1
obviously there's a big training effect as you can imagine,1
right who thinks you could beat the chimps wrong,1
everyone chooses a number from zero to we're going to compute the average of those numbers and whoever's closest to two thirds of the average wins a fixed prize,0
a lot of people say i really don't know what people are going to pick so i think the average will be,0
that's better,0
why not us and thanks to the people of interface i have become a recovering,1
it is practical and pretty too,1
and as my good friend and adviser amory lovins says if something exists it must be possible,1
in his book paul charges business and industry as one the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess,0
asked later in the canadian documentary the corporation what i meant by the go to jail remark i offered that theft is a crime,0
still it works to help us understand the problem,0
like yourself i'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not depending on the circumstances,1
the good news is i married her the next year,1
some got killed and some did it without drug assistance,0
if you look at it and focus on the white what you see is a world full of angels,0
then at breakfast the pig that i followed the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an of dough,1
and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter,1
fine bone china this is a real classic,0
but i didn't want you to miss out on this one because this well it's called portion controlled meat cuts,0
for the in the audience i love what doing i admire the guts i admire the courage but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction,1
the rational for the worlds first flight school goes something like when the come up to me and say they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous they would come up and say do you have a license for that and then id put my sunglasses on the beard that would all sprout out and i would say i need no stinking license,1
if you think that the relative importance two to one wrong by a factor of ten,0
the problem we have in believing that is you just have to give up this notion that this earth was created for us,0
for instance me and my sister when we were little we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains,1
so i should talk about art,1
i'm just going to make the whole thing myself,1
i figured out their bios their passions in life and their art styles and i started making their work,1
one of these is scratch off masterpieces,1
and in this one it's called drawing the short stick,1
this one's called love song's nest,1
and the second thing that i was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique,0
so i should start to talk about these guys,0
i'm under the river with those fish,0
and what i loved about her work is when i would walk around it and look down into the sky looking down to watch the sky and it unfolded in a new way,0
the next artist is kay and she's interested in and transience,0
for this family he made this still life painting,0
and so they're valuable,0
and you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for,0
and this piece those aren't actually leaves,0
thank you,0
well interestingly what you find there is usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the center as they may call it and more often than not it's an indian,1
once you take this there's no reason to restrict innovation the beneficiaries of innovation just to end users,0
in case you're wondering this is our strength test,1
we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film,1
that's more than you pay for ted if dropped their sponsorship,1
along the way we've discovered fantastic and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight,0
the idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there otherwise in damp moist cold conditions in utterly dark places,0
i don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time,0
this is some life support equipment closed cycle,0
is that true if he did he was a very lucky man,1
i think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental and perhaps not planned at all,0
clouds,1
i know firsthand,0
okay,1
and as if that wasn't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot,1
we went to home depot well over a hundred times,1
small stuff stinks but of course it's essential right what else planning is incredibly important,1
we'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted,0
so we were really excited about working with them,0
so we came up with a list of requirements the commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty the first is no magic,0
so we have this foot warehouse we were using divided between two floors,0
little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to get right,0
she's at the ted prize,1
no pun intended,1
people started to ask me where is this guy now al offered him a job,1
now josh rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with al,1
wow some of you watched it,0
this is donna at the statue of liberty,0
but i'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera a projector and a screen,0
there was a center there where they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage,0
now i think that we can all agree that mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love,1
of all of the available women in the all peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him somebody in the right age range somebody with a university degree somebody he's likely to get on well with somebody who's likely to be attractive somebody who's likely to find him attractive,1
and so to try to persuade you of how totally amazing excellent and relevant mathematics is i want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love,1
but my particular favorite is that it turns out that on an online dating website how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are and actually having people think that you're ugly can work to your advantage,1
because i know just as well as all of you do that love doesn't really work like that,0
it's this spread that makes you more popular on an online internet dating website,0
so he recorded what was said in the conversation he recorded their skin conductivity he recorded their facial expressions their heart rates their blood pressure basically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right which incidentally she totally is,0
but actually the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true,0
so those are my top three tips of how can help you with love and relationships,0
so i learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go,0
no slouching no pants hanging down none of that stuff,1
see if it works,1
i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was,1
average which i shouldn't have been allowed in with and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months,1
so they shipped me off to the army and lo and behold many years later i'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had,1
we'll get another kid,1
they never left,1
they never cooked,1
gotta have a dirty water dog,1
you'll notice that the building is rather austere,0
i say now listen,0
and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately the drill sergeant,0
and that's just the way it is,0
i'm telling you you didn't shave,0
and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children,0
it's part of the answer,0
and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're much to the distress of my children they are acting just like we did,0
every child ought to have a good start in life,0
that's what's going on,0
we don't have time to waste for that,0
that's how the system's supposed to work,0
it doesn't surprise me that in this climate many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like jiffy lube,1
once though he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize,1
let me introduce him,0
i mean here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch this little passion that had developed then they thought they were fighting the cold war and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte,1
because before the spread of coffee and tea through british culture what people drank both elite and mass folks drank day in and day out from dawn until dusk was alcohol,0
and so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as england switched to tea and coffee,0
we're designing environments that make us crazy,1
some of my best friends are architects,1
or who say don't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for people,1
sound affects us physiologically psychologically and all the time,0
a room like this has acoustics this one very good acoustics,0
they had to go back in and spend pounds putting the walls in,0
walk up to it and smack it on the backside,1
puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you,1
i come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country,0
we lived under apartheid regime,0
they could sell these things for anything between a kilo,0
and it's so tempting to think that it's all about me,1
this is the closest to an oriental feast that you will ever get in vienna,1
in tel aviv they come to my concerts,1
he means mozart which is like a third seat from the center,1
so he had to resign,1
it says never look at the trombones it only encourages them,1
he says you start when you can't stand it anymore,1
next video please,1
they do need to go to a for two weeks later,1
you know this little office of the conductor,0
i hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony,0
people who build this wonderful concert hall,0
yeah so clear,0
or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them saying come on guys,0
he says this is the gesture of the music,0
that's what he does,0
see he is there percent but not commanding not telling what to do,0
you see that first of all it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get,0
and all you put together in partnership brings about the best music,0
but when i'm sitting in my car after an hour and a half of commute every day that reality looks very different,1
with that amount of time ancient egyptians could have built pyramids of giza,1
the result a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of german and the creative vitality of the intersections of,1
wow i thought our vascular system all the veins and arteries in our body making miracles of logistics every day,0
i don't know if you realize but each of us has miles of blood vessels in our bodies miles,0
if our surface grid is saturated well let's elevate our traffic,0
those drivers could all fit in one red bus,0
now i'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters,1
and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles,1
it was the only way for me to save the marriage because beverly felt she was being replaced you see,1
okay so she was a little bit rough,1
and well we can report in fact that we're grandparents,1
but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that individual personality that these animals have,0
this particular one is called he who greets with fire and you can just see that about him you know that's his character,0
but we're really there seeking and searching and filming the cats,0
and we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the side of nature and gang warfare,0
i actually wrote hopefully for the last time in public ever,1
i love the little smile she does right over the top of the note like no problem everything's fine,1
they wouldn't have me,0
it sounds great,0
that's about the percentage of the american public that believes the moon landing was a fake,1
and if you want proof let's start where most conversations in the us seem to start with kim kardashian,1
suddenly my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare being told that my brother was going to die actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted for matt to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury,0
only instead of doing it to sell products doing it to save lives,0
it makes for an exotic and chilly commute,1
it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages,0
i turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go home and at that moment you came out of the student union building wearing the stupidest hat i've ever seen in my life,1
it was creepy,1
he just kind of held the lollipop out like this,1
but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with,0
and she told me a story that had happened four years earlier,0
it's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful frightening to think we can matter that much to other people,0
we need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments how many of them we create how many we acknowledge how many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for,0
now i can't speak for you but it seems to be the case that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to,1
and just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else's brain to suit your interests,0
this is the machine he built,1
here we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will but capable of only two ideas,1
this is a letter from the director concerned about especially unfair on the matter of sugar,1
so there's of these tubes like a engine running the memory,1
no use went home,1
damn it i can be just as stubborn as this thing,1
way off,1
so they really were working under tough conditions,1
i know when i'm licked,1
even errors were duplicated,1
the instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail,0
maniac regained its memory when the power went off,0
they have to have something,0
the last time china had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened,1
the one was kittens on a treadmill but that's the internet for you,1
and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression,0
it isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society,0
people were eating boxed lunches on tables and there was a sad band playing music or a band playing sad music probably both,1
enigma number one how do you create jobs in america in a global economy number two very quickly how do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in congress seems to be the norm in fact there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared congress's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things and it was found in fact that congress's approval rating is worse than cockroaches lice the band root canals and donald trump,1
i was elected in and at the end of my first year in office in i got a call from one of my staff members who said gov we have a big problem,0
i'm the new governor,0
and then she actually built it,1
we have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation,1
so that's the blueprint of the house,1
it's a challenge how do you make a ceiling if you don't have any flat boards to work with let me tell you sometimes i dream of sheet rock and plywood,1
it can get hot in the tropics so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes,0
each year it sends up a new generation of shoots,0
it's strong,0
nine of them are at green village you've just seen inside some of these homes and we fill them with furniture we surround them with veggie gardens we would love to invite you all to come visit someday,0
as though she's a southern waitress,1
or maybe it's called being a workaholic,1
nothing out of the ordinary,1
all that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that frozen girl needs to let go of,1
i've got issues,1
your child does not think you're that interesting,1
if i'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy i'm invisible after minutes,1
did i want to be on live tv no but yes,0
and it's had a magical effect on me on my children on our family,0
no,0
in america my television shows are back to back to back on thursday night,0
for me my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air,0
i love working,0
i just know that i want to tell you i'm a titan and i know that i don't want to question it,0
i love that hum,0
dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy he just felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in world war on account of his handicap although they did let him get through the several army physical exam before they got to the very last test which was for vision,1
in that sense yes,1
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny to penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan to nine lives it's all the same,1
now this gives a real meaning to the term blind faith which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people,0
now we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science but i think it's also true in the arts it's true in politics it's even true in personal endeavors,0
these are four very different ways of looking at the world,0
what i'm searching for is a durable mutation that's what all of us are searching for,0
