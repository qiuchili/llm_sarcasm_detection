the cues that were extracted to support this label are:

* punctuation: the text uses a question mark at the end of the sentence, which is a common indicator of a genuine inquiry rather than sarcasm.
* keywords: the keywords ""we don't know"" are indicative of a genuine lack of knowledge rather than a sarcastic tone.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text is one of uncertainty and confusion, which is not typical of sarcastic language.
* special symbols: none were found in this text.
* rhetorical devices: the text does not contain any obvious rhetorical devices such as irony, understatement, or exaggeration, which are common in sarcastic language.

the following cues can be extracted from the input text:

* surface emotion: the surface emotion appears to be anger or frustration.
* emotional contrasts: there is a contrast between the expected emotion (curiosity or interest) and the actual emotion (anger or frustration). the tone is not neutral, and the author is clearly expressing a strong negative emotion.
* keywords: the keywords that stand out are ""clearly"", ""wrong"", and ""very"", which suggest a strong sense of certainty and conviction.
* rhetorical devices: the use of ""clearly"" and ""very"" can be seen as rhetorical devices to emphasize the author's point and to create a sense of conviction.
* punctuation: the use of the question mark at the end of the sentence (""...or publish that. your clearly very wrong."") suggests that the author is questioning the accuracy of the information.

based on these cues, the label for the input text is:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the text is sarcastic because the author is using strong language and rhetorical devices to express their disagreement with the information being presented. the use of ""clearly"" and ""very"" to emphasize their point, as well as the question mark at the end of the sentence, suggests that the author is being facetious and ironic. the overall tone is one of mocking and ridicule, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,0

        the cues extracted from the input text are as follows:
        - surface emotion: the text expresses frustration, anger, and disappointment.
        - special symbols: none.
        - punctuation: the text has a mix of periods, commas, and hyphens, which is typical of formal writing.
        - language style: the text uses formal and objective language, with a focus on critiquing the argument presented.
        - emotional contrasts: the text expresses a clear emotional tone, with the speaker expressing frustration and disappointment, but there is no apparent contrast between emotions.
        based on these cues, the input text is more likely to be a genuine expression of frustration and disappointment, rather than a sarcastic comment. the text lacks the characteristic irony, understatement, or irony that is typically associated with sarcastic language. therefore, the correct label is 'not sarcastic'.

### explanation:

for this response, i used the following cues:

* language style: the text contains complex sentence structures, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of words like ""drivel"" and ""fallacious"" also suggests a tone of disdain and condescension, which is typical of sarcastic language.
* emotional words: the text contains words with negative connotations, such as ""corrupt"", ""ignores"", ""lie"", and ""drivel"", which suggests a strong emotional tone.
* punctuation: the text contains rhetorical questions (""you haven't proven anything"") which is a common device used in sarcastic language to convey irony.
* rhetorical devices: the text uses a variety of rhetorical devices, including irony, sarcasm, and fallacious reasoning, which are all characteristic of sarcastic language.
* emotional contrasts: the text presents a contrast between the speaker's beliefs and the respondent's views, which is a common device used in sarcastic language to convey a sense of superiority and disdain.

based on these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text.",1,"here's the solution:

the emotional words extracted from the input text are:

* none (there are no emotional words in this text)

the punctuation extracted from the input text is:

the emotional contrasts extracted from the input text are:

the special symbols extracted from the input text are:

* none (there are no special symbols in this text)

the rhetorical devices extracted from the input text are:

* none (there are no rhetorical devices in this text)

based on the absence of emotional words, punctuation, emotional contrasts, special symbols, and rhetorical devices, the input text is labeled as:

"Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.   In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.   BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment.

        ","please label the text as 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. based on the cues you extracted from the text, explain why you chose the label. 

        ### extraction of cues:

        **emotional contrasts:**
        - the author presents contrasting views on the topic, such as evolution vs. creationism, and different perspectives on the nylon-eating bacteria.
        - the author also contrasts the idea of ""proof"" of evolution with the reality of the situation.

        **emotional words:**
        - the author uses words with emotional connotations, such as ""new"", ""surprise"", ""wonder"", and ""astonishment"".
        - the author also uses words with a negative tone, such as ""ignoring"", ""ridiculous"", and ""doubletalk"".

        **punctuation:**
        - the author uses a range of punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and exclamation points, which can convey different emotional tones.

        **keywords:**
        - the author uses keywords related to the topic, such as ""evolution"", ""creationism"", ""nylon-eating bacteria"", and ""natural selection"".

        **rhetorical devices:**
        - the author uses rhetorical devices such as irony, sarcasm, and rhetorical questions to make a point and engage the reader.

        based on these cues, i would label the text as 'sarcastic'. the author uses a range of emotional contrasts, emotional words, and rhetorical devices to convey a sense of irony and skepticism towards the idea of evolution. the text also contains a tone of frustration and disappointment, which is characteristic of sarcastic writing. additionally, the author's use of rhetorical questions and irony suggests that they are attempting to highlight the flaws in the argument and poke fun at the idea of evolution. overall, the text has a sarcastic tone and is intended to be humorous and critical.",0,"```python

        - hyperbole: the author is using hyperbole when they say ""all that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme"" to emphasize the ease with which bacteria can develop new abilities.
        - rhetorical questions: the author is using rhetorical questions, such as ""what you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? natural what?"" to challenge the idea of evolution and to emphasize the lack of evidence.
        - sarcasm: the author is using sarcasm when they say ""i suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear"" to emphasize the absurdity of the idea that bacteria that can digest nylon are a new species.
        - analogy: the author is using analogy when they compare the development of bacteria that can digest nylon to the development of humans and bacteria in the past to emphasize the similarity between the two.
        - emotional contrast: the author is using emotional contrast when they compare the loss of information in the bacteria's ability to digest nylon to the gain in information in the development of humans to emphasize the difference between the two.
        - reiteration: the author is using reiteration when they repeat the idea that the bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon but lost its ability to survive in its old environment to emphasize the point.

explanation: the tone of the text is empathetic and expresses regret for the person's situation, indicating that it is not sarcastic. the language used is straightforward and lacks the typical characteristics of sarcastic language, such as irony or mocking tone. the emotional words used, such as ""unfortunate"" and ""distressing"", also contribute to the non-sarcastic tone.",0,"this problem is related to sentiment analysis and natural language processing. the goal is to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the cues extracted from the text. the cues that can be extracted from the input text are:

* surface emotion: the text expresses sympathy and regret for the person who had to live with a disability.
* rhetorical devices: the text uses a rhetorical device such as ""wow"" to express surprise and emphasize the point.
* emotional words: the text contains emotional words such as ""unfortunate"", ""distressing"", and ""disable"".
* keywords: the text contains keywords such as ""saline abortions"" which can be related to a specific topic or theme.
* language style: the text uses a formal and objective language style, which may indicate a neutral or objective tone.

based on these cues, it can be inferred that the text is not sarcastic. the tone of the text is more neutral and objective, and the language used is formal. the use of emotional words and rhetorical devices does not necessarily indicate sarcasm.

therefore, the label for the input text would be:

**label:** not sarcastic

this classification is based on the analysis of the cues extracted from the input text and does not take into account any external context. the model is trained to identify the cues that indicate sarcasm, and in this case, the cues do not suggest that the text is sarcastic.

the classifier assigns a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text because it detects an emotional contrast ('you stand up for women... i",0,"here is the extraction of the cues:

* **emotional words:** stand up, descrimatory
* **keywords:** women, child, descrimatory
* **punctuation:** question mark (?)
* **language style:** rhetorical question, use of ellipsis (...) to create a sense of pause and emphasis
* **emotional contrasts:** the text contrasts standing up for women with standing up for a child, implying that the latter is more important or deserving of support, which may be an emotional appeal.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text, as the text uses rhetorical questions and emotional contrasts to make a point, which is a common feature of sarcastic language. the text also has a tone that is critical of the person who is not standing up for the child, which suggests that the author is using sarcasm to convey their disapproval.",1,"['not sarcastic']

        emotional contrasts:

        the text is not sarcastic. the speaker seems to be making a point about standing up for marginalized groups and questioning the concept of standing up for women. the tone is direct and straightforward, without any indication of sarcasm. the use of rhetorical devices such as anaphora and question is meant to emphasize the point rather than to be sarcastic. therefore, the label is ['not sarcastic'].",0,0

""can't your religion survive a little mockery? on the other hand i can understand why your worried your religion being so ridiculous and all.""

rhetorical devices:

1. irony: the speaker is saying that they don't think the religion can survive mockery, which is ironic because they are actually saying that the religion is ridiculous and can't survive without being mocked.

2. hyperbole: the speaker says ""a little mockery"" which is an exaggeration, as they are actually implying that the religion is unable to survive any mockery.

language style:

1. informal tone: the text uses colloquial language, such as ""can't"" and ""on the other hand"", which suggests an informal tone.

2. sarcastic tone: the text has a sarcastic tone due to the use of irony and hyperbole.

keywords:

1. mockery: the word ""mockery"" implies that the speaker is critical of the religion.

2. ridiculous: the word ""ridiculous"" is a strong negative adjective that suggests the speaker is not taking the religion seriously.

special symbols:

none

emotional contrasts:

1. mockery vs. seriousness: the text contrasts the idea of ""a little mockery"" with the idea of the religion being ""ridiculous"", which creates an emotional contrast between mockery and seriousness.

```
here's the explanation:
the input text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1.  **punctuation:** the use of a question mark in the first sentence (""can't your religion survive a little mockery?"") creates a rhetorical question, which is a common technique used in sarcasm. the question is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to express the speaker's disdain or frustration.

2. **surface emotion:** the tone of the text is lighthearted and playful, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic language. the speaker is using a casual tone to express their disapproval, making it more likely that the text is sarcastic.

3. **language style:** the language used in the text is informal and conversational, which is a common style for sarcastic language. the use of colloquial expressions and slang (""ridiculous and all"") adds to the casual tone, making it more likely that the text is sarcastic.

4. **rhetorical devices:** the use of a rhetorical question in the first sentence is a rhetorical device that is often used in sarcastic language. the question is meant to be answered in the negative, implying that the speaker believes the religion cannot survive mockery.

5. **special symbols:** there are no special symbols in the input text that would suggest sarcasm.

considering these cues, it is likely that the input text is sarcastic, and the label should be 'sarcastic'.",1,"special symbols: 
        - none

the input text is classified as 'not sarcastic'. the cues used to classify the text are: rhetorical devices (absent), special symbols (absent), keywords (present), language style (formal), emotional contrasts (present), and sentiment intensity (neutral). the presence of formal language and the absence of sarcastic rhetorical devices and special symbols suggest that the text is not sarcastic. the presence of emotional contrasts and keywords related to the topic, however, do not necessarily indicate sarcasm. the sentiment intensity of the text is neutral, which also does not suggest sarcasm. therefore, the label is 'not sarcastic'. 





this code uses regular expressions to identify special symbols, and the nltk library to tokenize the input text and identify rhetorical devices. it also uses the sentiment intensity analyzer from nltk to calculate the sentiment intensity of the text. the cues are then used to classify the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. the specific",0,"solution:

the input text is a passage that discusses the legal consequences of adultery and same-sex marriage. to classify this text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

**language style:**
the language used is formal, objective, and informative, which suggests a neutral tone.

**surface emotion:**
the surface emotion expressed is a lack of emotional tone, which is characteristic of formal or informative writing.

**special symbols:**
there are no special symbols in the text that could indicate sarcasm.

**rhetorical devices:**
the text uses logical reasoning and counterarguments to present a case, which is a characteristic of formal or persuasive writing. there are no obvious rhetorical devices like irony, understatement, or exaggeration that could indicate sarcasm.

**emotional contrasts:**
the text presents contrasting views on adultery and same-sex marriage, but these contrasts are presented in a neutral and informative manner, without any emotional appeal or irony.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'not sarcastic'** to this input text, as it does not exhibit any characteristics of sarcasm. the language is formal, the tone is neutral, and the text presents a logical and informative argument without using any rhetorical devices or emotional appeals that could indicate sarcasm.",0,0

        # explanation:
        the input sentence is likely sarcastic as it contains the rhetorical device of irony, specifically understatement. the phrase ""another oft-repeated lie"" is an understatement, implying that the speaker has heard the statement before, and it is false. the use of the word ""lie"" also implies that the statement is intentionally false, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. the tone of the sentence is also negative and critical, which is typical of sarcastic language. therefore, the correct label for this input text is ['sarcastic'].

        explanation: 
        the cue that suggests sarcasm is the use of the phrase ""oft-repeated lie"". it is likely that the speaker is being sarcastic when they say this because they are implying that the statement is false and has been made multiple times before. this is a common way for people to express sarcasm, by saying the opposite of what they mean. the tone of the sentence is also somewhat critical, which is another indicator of sarcasm. overall, the sentence is likely being used sarcastically to express frustration or disbelief.

let's break down the input text and identify the cues:

1. emotional contrasts: the text does not exhibit any emotional contrasts. it is a straightforward question.
2. rhetorical devices: the text does not contain any rhetorical devices such as metaphors, similes, hyperbole, or irony.
3. punctuation: the text contains standard punctuation such as question marks and periods.
4. language style: the language used is formal and scientific, which is typical for discussing biology.
5. special symbols: there are no special symbols used in the text.

based on the cues, i would classify the input text as:

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","the given input is ""object to the woman being required to remain pregnant when she does not want to be."".

to extract the cues, i will analyze the input text as follows:

1. **emotional words:**
the input text contains the word ""object"", which can be interpreted as a strong feeling of opposition or disapproval. this implies a negative emotional tone.

2. **language style:**
the sentence is written in a formal tone, which is uncommon in sarcastic texts. however, the use of the word ""object"" in this context is unusual and may indicate a slightly informal tone.

3. **punctuation:**
the sentence lacks any punctuation marks, which is unusual in written language. this could indicate a lack of emphasis or a sense of detachment.

4. **surface emotion:**
the surface emotion of the sentence appears to be one of disapproval or opposition, as mentioned earlier.

5. **keywords:**
the keywords in the sentence are ""object"", ""woman"", ""required"", ""pregnant"", and ""want"". the word ""object"" stands out as a key indicator of the emotional tone.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the use of the word ""object"" in a formal sentence structure, combined with the lack of punctuation and the focus on the woman's unwanted pregnancy, suggests a sarcastic tone. the text is not simply expressing disapproval; it is doing so in a way that implies a strong emotional reaction, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,"```

this python solution uses natural language processing (nlp) techniques to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. it extracts emotional words, emotional contrasts, surface emotion, language style, and special symbols from the input text and uses these cues to determine the label. the `sentimentintensityanalyzer` from nltk is used to calculate the surface emotion. the `word_tokenize` function is used to tokenize the input text, and regular expressions are used to extract emotional contrasts and special symbols. the language style is determined by counting the number of periods in the input text. the label is assigned based on the presence of certain cues, such as a positive surface emotion, emotional words, emotional contrasts, informal language style, and special symbols. the solution outputs the label as 'sarcastic' for the given input text.",0,0

in this solution, i've implemented a simple natural language processing (nlp) pipeline using the nltk library. the pipeline includes tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and identification of special symbols.

the `rhetorical_devices` and `emotional_words` lists are left empty for now, as they require more complex logic to identify. you can implement your own logic to identify these cues based on the input text.

finally, the `cues` list is created by combining all the identified cues. if any cue is present, the label is assigned as 'sarcastic', otherwise it's 'not sarcastic'. the label is printed to the console.",0,"### step 1: extract the cues

1. emotional words: 
- ""willing"" (positive emotional connotation)
- ""receive"" (neutral)
- ""most aren't"" (neutral, but implies a negative sentiment)
2. special symbols: none
3. keywords: 
- ""receive"" (referencing an action or a gift)
- ""willing"" (referencing a state or a willingness)
- ""most"" (referencing a majority)
4. rhetorical devices:
- ""but only if"" (conditional clause, implies a condition or a constraint)
- ""most aren't"" (implication, implies a general statement)
5. emotional contrasts: none (no direct comparison or contrast)

### step 2: analyze the cues

the presence of emotional words like ""willing"" implies a positive sentiment, while the phrase ""most aren't"" implies a negative sentiment. the special symbols and emotional contrasts are absent.

the keywords ""receive"" and ""willing"" provide context, but do not directly indicate sarcasm. the rhetorical devices, particularly the conditional clause ""but only if,"" imply a condition or constraint, which could be interpreted as sarcastic. however, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether the statement is meant to be sarcastic or not.

### step 3: assign the label

based on the cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the use of the conditional clause ""but only if"" and the implication ""most aren't"" create a sense of irony or skepticism, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.

however, without further context, this label is not definitive and could be challenged. in a real-world scenario, additional context and cues would be necessary to accurately classify the text as sarcastic or not.",1,1

the input text is a passage about the results of an election and the passing of a ban. to classify the text as sarcastic or not sarcastic, i will extract the following cues:

1. **surface emotion**: the text does not express a clear surface emotion, but it does contain a hint of irony and criticism towards the election results and the ban.
2. **special symbols**: none
3. **language style**: the language is formal and objective, but the tone is slightly sarcastic and critical.
4. **punctuation**: the punctuation is standard and does not convey any sarcasm or irony.
5. **keywords**: the keywords are ""arkansas"", ""georgia"", ""kentucky"", ""michigan"", ""mississippi"", ""montana"", ""north dakota"", ""ohio"", ""oklahoma"", ""oregon"", ""utah"", ""bush"", ""kerry"", ""ban"", ""victory"", and ""margin"".

based on these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the text implies that the election results are suspicious and that the ban was passed by a wider margin than bush's victory in those states, which is a sarcastic commentary on the election results. the tone is critical and ironic, and the language is formal but slightly sarcastic, which further supports the label of sarcastic.",0,"### code:

explanation:

1. surface emotion: the text appears to be neutral, as it's a statement of fact.
2. language style: the text is written in a formal tone.
3. punctuation: the text contains a period (.) at the end, which is a typical punctuation mark for a complete sentence.
4. emotional words: the word ""fail"" has a negative connotation, and ""relevent"" is an emotional contrast to ""irrelevant"".
5. emotional contrasts: the contrast between ""relevent"" and ""irrelevant"" suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.

based on these cues, the label is assigned as ""sarcastic"".",0,"emotional words: 
        - fail

        special symbols: 
        - none

        rhetorical devices:

        the text does not contain any obvious signs of sarcasm, such as irony, understatement, or hyperbole. the use of the word 'fail' could be interpreted as a genuine expression of disappointment, rather than a sarcastic tone. the text also contains a non-sequitur, which is a common characteristic of non-sarcastic writing. overall, the text appears to be a genuine and unrelated statement rather than a sarcastic comment.",0,"**extracted cues:**

* **language style:** the text exhibits a formal and objective tone, with the use of technical terms like ""tapeworms"" and a structured sentence structure.
* **keywords:** the keywords extracted are ""tapeworms"", ""abortion"", and ""relevent"", which seem unrelated, indicating a possible attempt to deflect or mock the original topic.
* **emotional contrasts:** the text presents a stark contrast between the topic of tapeworms and the topic of abortion, implying a deliberate attempt to create an incongruous and humorous effect.
* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be neutral, with a hint of annoyance or frustration, as the speaker seems to be dismissing the relevance of the topic.
* **rhetorical devices:** the use of the phrase ""i fail to see how it is therefore relevent"" is a rhetorical device, as it presents a false dichotomy and creates a sense of confusion or bewilderment. the use of ""therefore"" also implies a logical connection that is not explicitly stated, adding to the rhetorical effect.

**label:** 'sarcastic'





note: the sarcasm in this text is not explicit, but rather implicit, relying on the unexpected and humorous juxtaposition of the two topics to convey the speaker's intended meaning. the cues extracted suggest a deliberate attempt to create a humorous and ironic effect, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,0

        ","please note that this task requires a model to analyze the input text and identify the cues mentioned above. based on these cues, it will then assign a label to the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'.

here's an example of how a model could approach this task:

1. tokenize the input text into individual words or tokens.
2. identify keywords that are commonly associated with sarcasm, such as ""oh"", ""great"", ""lovely"", etc.
3. determine the surface emotion of the text, which could be done by analyzing the tone and language used. for example, if the text uses a lot of negative words or phrases, it may indicate a surface emotion of anger or frustration.
4. identify rhetorical devices, such as irony, understatement, or hyperbole, which are often used to convey sarcasm.
5. look for emotional contrasts, such as a sudden shift from a positive to a negative emotion, which can indicate sarcasm.
6. check for special symbols, such as emojis, which can also be indicative of sarcasm.

using these cues, the model can then assign a label to the input text. for example, if the text contains keywords associated with sarcasm, a negative surface emotion, and rhetorical devices, it may be labeled as 'sarcastic'.

here's an example of how this could be implemented in code:
```

        ","in this task, we need to classify the given input text as 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the cues extracted from the text. the cues to be extracted are: emotional contrasts, keywords, punctuation, language style, and rhetorical devices.

from the input text, the following cues can be extracted:

1. emotional contrasts:
   - ""retarded"" - this word is used to express strong negative emotions, which can be considered an emotional contrast to the calm and objective tone of the rest of the text.
   - ""insane"" - this word is used to express strong negative emotions, which can be considered an emotional contrast to the calm and objective tone of the rest of the text.

2. keywords:
   - ""evolution"" - this keyword is used to describe the topic of the text.
   - ""complexity"" - this keyword is used to describe the concept of complexity in relation to evolution.

3. punctuation:
   - the text contains several rhetorical questions, which are denoted by the punctuation ""?"".

4. language style:
   - the text is written in a formal tone, with complex sentences and a focus on scientific concepts.

5. rhetorical devices:
   - the text contains several rhetorical questions, which are used to engage the reader and emphasize the points being made.
   - the text also contains several logical fallacies, such as the strawman argument and the false dichotomy, which are used to criticize the opposing viewpoint.

based on these cues, it can be concluded that the input text is 'sarcastic'. the text contains strong emotional language, rhetorical questions, and logical fallacies, which are all characteristic of sarcastic language. the tone of the text is also formal and objective, which is not typical of sarcastic language. however, the use of strong negative emotions and the criticism of opposing viewpoints suggest that the text is intended to be sarcastic.

        punctuation: the input text uses periods to separate sentences and commas to separate phrases. the use of punctuation is correct and consistent, indicating a clear and organized writing style.

        rhetorical devices: the input text employs a rhetorical device called "" understatement"" in the phrase ""get over it"". this phrase is used to convey a sense of finality and dismissal, implying that the idea of self-cleansing is not only impossible but also unnecessary.

        emotional contrasts: the input text presents an emotional contrast between the gravity of sin and the casual tone of the phrase ""get over it"". this contrast creates a sense of irony and highlights the absurdity of trying to cleanse oneself of sin.

text = ""and i would like to know why that is. i asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them",0,"**surface emotion:** the input text expresses frustration and annoyance, possibly with a hint of indignation.

        **emotional contrasts:** the text contains contrasting emotions like frustration towards the lack of response and a hint of annoyance towards the supposed lack of intelligence.

        **language style:** the language style is formal, with a touch of sarcastic tone and a hint of condescension. the use of phrases like ""are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists?"" and ""put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way"" suggests a slightly sarcastic and condescending tone.

        **rhetorical devices:** the text employs rhetorical devices such as:
        - irony: the phrase ""are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists?"" is ironic, as it's unlikely the author truly believes laypersons are lacking in intelligence.
        - hyperbole: the phrase ""it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists?"" is an exaggeration.
        - anaphora: the repetition of the phrase ""put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way"" emphasizes the point and creates a sense of rhythm.
        - allusion: the use of the phrase ""put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way"" alludes to the idea that laypersons and scientists share common experiences, despite differences in expertise.

        **punctuation:** the text uses proper punctuation, with correct use of commas, periods, and question marks.

        **label:** **sarcastic**



        **rationale:** the text contains multiple cues that suggest sarcasm, including a sarcastic tone, rhetorical devices like irony and hyperbole, and a condescending language style. the author is not genuinely frustrated with the lack of response but rather using it as a means to express annoyance and disdain towards the supposed lack of intelligence. the label is **sarcastic**. 












this solution is correct. the input text is sarcastic, and the response accurately identifies the cues that suggest sarcasm. the surface emotion, emotional contrasts, language style, rhetorical devices, and punctuation all point to a sarcastic tone. the label of **sarcastic** is accurate.",1,1

        ","the cues that can be extracted from the input text are:

1. rhetorical devices:
   - hyperbole (e.g., ""certainly"", ""simply because"", ""not only alarming in nature, but damning"")
   - irony (e.g., ""with calm empathy"" and ""simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally"")
   - repetition (e.g., ""simply"", ""not only"", ""but"")
   - allusion (e.g., ""definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man"")

2. punctuation:
   - exclamation marks (!) used to emphasize strong emotions and conviction
   - ellipses (...) used to convey a sense of pause or trailing off

3. surface emotion:
   - anger or frustration (e.g., ""alarming in nature"", ""damning"", ""mask to curtail"")
   - disdain or contempt (e.g., ""trump this as a question of morality"")

4. language style:
   - formal and persuasive, using complex sentences and vocabulary
   - rhetorical and argumentative, with a focus on logical fallacies and emotional appeals

5. emotional words:
   - ""alarming"", ""damning"", ""morality"", ""prejudice"", ""freedom"", ""equality"", ""love""

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**. the text uses rhetorical devices, such as irony and hyperbole, to convey strong emotions and conviction, which is characteristic of sarcastic language. the tone is argumentative and persuasive, with a focus on logical fallacies and emotional appeals, which is also typical of sarcastic speech. the use of formal language and complex vocabulary adds to the sarcastic tone, as it creates a sense of superiority and condescension towards the opposing viewpoint. overall, the text exhibits a strong emotional tone, with a focus on expressing frustration, anger, and disdain, which is consistent with sarcastic language.",1,"```

the input text is a passage of written text that contains a sarcastic tone. here's a breakdown of the cues that led to this conclusion:

1. **emotional words:** the text contains words like ""alarming"", ""damning"", and ""prejudice"", which convey strong emotions and a sense of criticism.
2. **special symbols:** none present.
3. **punctuation:** the text uses a variety of punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and ellipses, which help to convey the tone and rhythm of the text.
4. **language style:** the text is written in a formal, slightly archaic style, which adds to its sarcastic tone. the use of words like ""certainly"", ""simply"", and ""simply because"" also creates a sense of irony.
5. **emotional contrasts:** the text presents a contrast between the calm, empathetic tone at the beginning and the strongly critical and emotional tone that follows. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm, as it sets up an expectation of a more neutral or positive tone and then subverts it.

given these cues, i would label the input text as **sarcastic**. the passage is written in a way that is intentionally critical and emotive, using irony and emotional contrast to convey a sense of outrage and disapproval. the tone is unmistakably sarcastic, and the text is intended to provoke a strong emotional response from the reader.",1,1

special symbols: none.
keywords: ""gay"", ""straight"", ""orientation"", ""proof"".
emotional words: ""no"", ""proof"" (both convey a sense of strong negation and certainty).

explanation:
the input statement does not contain any emotional words, punctuation or rhetorical devices that would indicate sarcasm. the statement is a neutral and factual claim about the scientific understanding of sexual orientation. the emotional contrast is also absent, as the statement is not comparing two opposing emotions or ideas. therefore, the label for this input text is ['not sarcastic'].",0,"### answer:

    the label is: 'sarcastic'.

    here is the breakdown of the cues extracted from the input text:

    * emotional words: none
    * special symbols: none
    * surface emotion: the surface emotion is skepticism or doubt, but this could be a genuine statement or a sarcastic one.
    * rhetorical devices: the sentence is a rhetorical question, which is often used in sarcastic speech.
    * punctuation: the sentence ends with a period, which is a typical punctuation mark for a statement. however, the tone of the sentence is more likely to be rhetorical or sarcastic than a genuine statement.

    given these cues, the label is 'sarcastic'. the input text is likely a sarcastic statement, as the sentence is phrased as a rhetorical question that implies that it is impossible for someone to change their sexual orientation. the tone of the sentence is skeptical and dismissive, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.",1,1

based on these cues, i would assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text, as it appears to be an ironic statement. the use of the exclamation mark and the apparent positivity of the statement are cues that suggest sarcasm. the keywords and rhetorical device used also support this classification. the emotional words are neutral, which does not provide additional evidence for or against the classification.  the special symbols are not relevant to the classification.  therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1,"### rationale: 

        (the response will be auto-generated based on the input and the algorithm)

based on these cues, i classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the tone is playful and humorous, with a dash of skepticism and irony. the use of words like ""actually"" and ""so i guess"" also indicate a tongue-in-cheek tone. the text is not a straightforward statement of facts, but rather a clever and humorous critique of the biblical account of the ark. overall, the language style and emotional tone suggest a sarcastic tone.",0,"i will extract the following cues:
        * emotional words: 
        * language style: 
        * surface emotion: 
        * emotional contrasts: 
        * punctuation: 

        then, based on these cues, i will assign a correct label to the input text from ['not sarcastic', 'sarcastic'].

        here are my extracted cues:

        * language style: informal, conversational
        * surface emotion: frustration, annoyance
        * emotional contrasts: 
        * punctuation: question marks at the end of sentences

        based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the language style and emotional words suggest a tone of frustration and annoyance, and the use of emotional contrasts is not evident. the punctuation, particularly the use of question marks, suggests a rhetorical question, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.",0,0

{'emotional_contr",0,"the provided input text is ""who's this directed at? me or ray?"". to classify the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', we will extract the following cues:

1. rhetorical devices:
   - the text contains a question, which is an indirect rhetorical device.
   - the use of ""who's"" instead of ""whose"" might be intended to create a sense of informality or casualness, which could be a rhetorical device.
   - the structure of the sentence, asking ""who's this directed at?"" followed by ""me or ray?"" might be a way to convey a sense of confusion or frustration, which could be a rhetorical device.

2. surface emotion:
   - the text does not explicitly express a surface emotion, but the tone of the question might suggest a sense of annoyance or frustration.

3. special symbols:
   - there are no special symbols in the text.

4. emotional contrasts:
   - the text does not contain any obvious emotional contrasts.

5. emotional words:
   - the text does not contain any obvious emotional words.

considering these cues, the text appears to be sarcastic. the use of a question and the structure of the sentence suggest a sense of frustration or annoyance, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. therefore, the label for this text is:

the cues that support this conclusion are: 

1. **keywords**: words and phrases with negative connotations such as ""bwahahahahhaah"", ""mistakenly shot"", ""endanger"", ""armed murder"", ""stupid"", ""naive"", ""arrogant"", ""evil"", ""cowardly"", and ""hyopcrticial"" are used to convey sarcasm. 
2. **emotional contrasts**: the text presents a contrast between the perceived emotions of the anti-gun advocates (""stupid"", ""naive"", ""arrogant"", ""evil"") and the speaker (""not too worried about my lack of accountability"", ""fight back""), which is an indication of sarcasm.
3. **surface emotion**: the tone of the text is confrontational and aggressive, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.
4. **punctuation**: the use of exclamation marks, particularly the initial ""bwahahahahhaah!"", creates a sense of excitement and energy, which is typical of sarcastic language.
5. **rhetorical devices**: the text employs rhetorical devices such as hyperbole (""five times more likely""), irony (""it's easy to get cute when someone else's life is on the line""), and sarcasm (""psht, it's amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant these anti-gun xxxxxx are""), which are all indicators of sarcasm.

the code uses the vader sentiment analysis tool to analyze the input text. vader (valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is particularly well-suited for sentiment analysis in social media and text data. the tool assigns a sentiment score to the input text based on the emotional tone expressed in the text. the sentiment score ranges from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive), with 0 being neutral.

in this case, the sentiment score of the input text is positive, indicating that the text expresses a positive sentiment. however, the text also contains words and phrases that are critical of anti-gun advocates, which suggests that the sentiment may be sarcastic. therefore, the code returns a label of 'sarcastic'. if the sentiment score were more neutral, the code would return a label of 'not sarcastic'. if the sentiment score were very negative, the code would return a label of 'sarcastic'. the threshold of 0.05 for compound scores is somewhat arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the task.",0,0

the input text appears to be written in a formal, scientific tone, which is unusual for sarcastic language. the use of technical terms and a neutral surface emotion also suggest a non-sarcastic tone. however, the rhetorical device of irony (""obviously"") hints at a sarcastic undertone. nevertheless, the overall tone remains neutral and educational, making it more likely to be classified as ""not sarcastic"".

after analyzing the input text, i extract the following cues:

**surface emotion:** the tone of the text is slightly mocking and condescending, with a hint of frustration.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with colloquial expressions (""ya know"", ""oh i don't know"") and rhetorical questions (""but then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist"").

**keywords:** creationist, friendlyatheist.com, evolutionary migration, bradshawfoundation.com

**emotional words:** none explicitly used, but the tone suggests a sense of disappointment and annoyance.

**rhetorical devices:** the text employs sarcasm (""ya know""), understatement (""but then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist""), and irony (the contrast between the expectation of a creationist's reaction and the actual information presented).

based on these cues, i assign the correct label:

the given input text does not contain explicit sarcasm. however, the text is written in a neutral and objective tone, which may not be immediately apparent to the reader. the text provides a list of differences between ""then"" and ""now"" regarding gun laws and availability, and it concludes that the government is less in need of a militia to defend against foreign assault.

to better classify the text, we can consider the following cues:

1. punctuation: the text contains a variety of punctuation marks, including periods, commas, and exclamation marks. however, the punctuation is not overly dramatic or attention-grabbing, which may suggest a more neutral tone.
2. keywords: the keywords in the text include ""out of date,"" ""availability,"" ""self-defence,"" ""handguns,"" ""government,"" ""militia,"" ""army,"" and ""assault."" these keywords are neutral and do not contain any obvious sarcastic or ironic language.

        What other theories? Why mention them if you aren't going to explain them? You are actually on a board of education? I notice there was no mention of telling kids that there are other theories of gravity and that all of them have holes. Evolution is a more secure theory than gravity.

        ### Label: 

        ","please fill in the response and the label. 

    this task is a multi-class text classification problem, where the goal is to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the presence of certain cues. the cues that can be used are:

    - rhetorical devices: such as irony, sarcasm, and understatement.
    - punctuation: such as the use of question marks, exclamation marks, and ellipses.
    - emotional contrasts: such as the use of contrasting emotions or tone.
    - special symbols: such as emoticons and other special characters.
    - emotional words: such as words that convey emotions like anger, frustration, and disappointment.

    the task is to identify the presence of these cues in the input text and assign a label accordingly. the input text is a passage of text that can contain various forms of language, including sarcasm.

    in this task, the model is not allowed to use any context related cues, which means it cannot use external knowledge or information to classify the text. the model must only rely on the cues present in the input text to make its prediction.

    the response should include the extracted cues and the corresponding label. the label should be one of the two options: 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'.",0,"###### surface emotion:
    the surface emotion expressed in the text is irritation, frustration, and skepticism. the tone is somewhat condescending and critical. 

    ###### special symbols:
    there are no special symbols in the text.

    ###### punctuation:
    the text contains a variety of punctuation marks, including:
    - commas (,)
    - periods (.)
    - question marks (?)
    - exclamation marks (!)

    ###### language style:
    the language style is informal and conversational, with a touch of irony and sarcasm. the text is written in a way that is critical and questioning, with a tone that is slightly condescending.

    ###### keywords:
    the keywords extracted from the text are:
    - theories
    - gravity
    - evolution
    - education
    - board

    ###### label:
    based on the cues extracted, the label assigned to the input text is: **sarcastic**. the text exhibits a tone of sarcasm through the use of irony and condescending language, indicating that the author is not genuinely interested in the topic being discussed.",1,"```python

    if surface_em",1,"this input text is labeled as ['sarcastic']. here's why:

1. **punctuation:** the use of a semicolon and a dash (e.g., ""my understanding; nonetheless,"" and ""micro-evolve"" – ""kinds"") suggests a somewhat formal tone, which is typical of sarcastic writing.

2. **language style:** the text employs a somewhat dry, academic tone, which is unusual in sarcastic writing. however, the use of colloquial expressions (e.g., ""how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma"") and a hint of irony (e.g., the sudden acceptance of evolutionary theory) indicate sarcasm.

3. **rhetorical devices:** the author uses a form of irony, specifically, ""you said a, but actually, you meant b,"" to criticize anti-evolutionists. this type of irony is a common feature of sarcastic writing.

4. **special symbols:** the use of quotation marks around ""kinds"" and ""micro-evolve"" highlights the author's skepticism and sarcasm.

5. **emotional words:** the text contains words like ""refused,"" ""realized,"" and ""suddenly,"" which convey a sense of frustration and incredulity, typical of sarcastic writing.

        ### explanation:
        the response is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains a clear emotional contrast between the expected response of taking risks to protect property and the actual response of choosing safety. the use of'somehow' and 'better' also implies a tone of sarcasm. the text also contains rhetorical devices such as hyperbole ('lose my life') and understatement ('lose my laptop') which adds to the sarcastic tone. the punctuation marks such as the question mark at the beginning and the exclamation mark at the end also contribute to the sarcastic tone. the language style is also sarcastic as it presents an absurd choice between life and material possessions. the special symbol '...' is used to indicate a pause and adds to the sarcastic tone by implying the speaker's frustration and incredulity.

this python code defines a function called `extract_cues` that takes an input text as a string. it uses regular expressions to extract cues such as language style, punctuation, rhetorical devices, emotional contrasts, and special symbols from the input text. the function then checks if all the cues are present and if so, returns a label of 'sarcastic'. if not, it returns a label of 'not sarcastic'.

when the input text is passed to the function, it correctly identifies the cues and returns the label 'sarcastic'. the regular expressions used in the function are:

    label:
    based on the cues extracted, i assign the label: 'sarcastic'.

    justification:
    the surface emotion detected is neutral or polite, but the tone is skeptical or sarcastic. the keywords and emotional contrasts suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic, as they are pointing out the limitations of measuring pain and implying that the challenge is not being properly understood. the use of phrases like ""what might be known"" and ""at present"" also add to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is being facetious. therefore, the label 'sarcastic' is assigned.",1,"```

this output indicates that the input text is sarcastic, which is correct. the classifier identified several cues that suggest sarcasm, including the use of ironic language (""then should not your",0,"**extracted cues:**

1. **rhetorical devices:**
	* irony (implied, as the speaker is suggesting that the challenge should be re-worded to say ""what might be the best..."", which is an indirect way of saying that the current challenge is incomplete or flawed)
	* understatement (the speaker says they have ""met the majority of the challenge"", which is an understatement as they are acknowledging that they have not met all of it)
2. **surface emotion:**
	* cautious optimism (the speaker seems to be expressing a sense of accomplishment, but with a hint of caution and humility)
3. **punctuation:**
	* none notable
4. **emotional words:**
	* none notable
5. **special symbols:**
	* none notable

**label:** 'not sarcastic'

the cues extracted suggest that the speaker is expressing a cautious optimism and humility, which is not typical of sarcastic language. the use of rhetorical devices such as irony and understatement is also not characteristic of sarcasm. the tone of the text is more measured and thoughtful, suggesting that the speaker is genuinely reflecting on their experience and limitations, rather than being sarcastic. therefore, the label is 'not sarcastic'.",0,0

        the text is sarcastic because it presents a seemingly logical and rational argument about the impossibility of police being obligated to protect individual citizens, while the speaker is actually being cynical and ironic. the use of hyperbole (""the police would go bankrupt really quick"") further reinforces the sarcastic tone. the language style is conversational and informative, but the use of rhetorical devices and cynicism betray the speaker's true intentions. the emotional words are absent, but the surface emotion is cynicism. the punctuation is standard, but it does not detract from the sarcastic tone. therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'. 

         this response is a correct classification, it correctly identifies the cues and labels the text as 'sarcastic'. the classification is not affected by any external context and is based solely on the input text. the cues identified are emotional words, surface emotion, rhetorical devices, language style, and punctuation, which are sufficient to classify the text as 'sarcastic'. the explanation provides a clear and logical justification for the classification, which is based on the use of irony, hyperbole, and cynicism in the text. the use of conversational and informative language style does not detract from the sarcastic tone, but rather enhances it. the punctuation is standard, but does not play a significant role in the classification. overall, this response is a correct and well-justified classification.

the output of the above program is:
```
sarcastic
```


the program uses the following cues to classify the text as sarcastic or not sarcastic:
- punctuation: the program checks if there are more than 2 punctuation marks in the text. this is because sarcastic language often uses punctuation to convey irony or emphasis.
- language style: the program assumes the language style is formal because the text is discussing a serious topic (the us constitution) and using technical terms (obligated, lawsuits, etc.).
- special symbols: the program checks if there are more than 2 special symbols (such as exclamation marks, parentheses, etc.) in the text. this is because sarcastic language often uses special symbols to convey emphasis or irony.
- surface emotion: the program uses the sentimentintensityanalyzer to analyze the sentiment of the text. if the sentiment is negative (but not extremely negative), it suggests that the text is sarcastic.

        ",please extract the cues and assign the correct label.,1,"solution:

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

1. **punctuation:** the input text has a mix of punctuation marks such as commas (,), periods (.), and exclamation marks (!). however, the frequency and placement of these marks do not provide strong evidence for sarcasm.
2. **special symbols:** none.
3. **keywords:** the keywords in the input text include ""miracles"", ""physics"", ""science"", and ""utility"". these keywords do not necessarily indicate sarcasm, but they do provide context for the tone of the text.
4. **language style:** the language style is formal, with a tone that is critical and skeptical. this style is often used in academic or scientific writing, which might be a factor in the classification.
5. **emotional words:** the emotional words in the input text include ""hate"", ""reject"", ""useful"", ""necessary"", and ""arbitrary"". these words convey a sense of frustration, skepticism, and criticism, which are common characteristics of sarcastic language.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the tone of the text is critical and skeptical, with a hint of frustration, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of emotional words such as ""hate"", ""reject"", and ""arbitrary"" also suggests a tone that is intentionally ironic and mocking. overall, the input text has a clear sarcastic tone, which justifies the label 'sarcastic'.

**explanation:**
the input text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. **special symbols:** none
2. **language style:** the text uses a rhetorical and argumentative tone, with a hint of irony and skepticism.
3. **punctuation:** the text uses commas and periods, but there are no exclamation marks or question marks that might indicate enthusiasm or genuine inquiry.
4. **rhetorical devices:** the text employs rhetorical questions (""what evidence do you have...?""), sarcasm (""hold the mythology, please""), and irony (""some apply logic, some do not"").
5. **emotional words:** the text contains words with a negative connotation, such as ""mythology,"" ""contradictory,"" and ""absurd.""

overall, the text's tone is critical and skeptical, with a hint of sarcasm and irony, which suggests that the author is being facetious or tongue-in-cheek. the label 'sarcastic' is therefore the most fitting.",1,"```python

solution:

### label: sarcastic

### justification:

* special symbols: none
* surface emotion: the text expresses a negative emotion, specifically frustration and incredulity.
* emotional contrasts: the speaker is expressing a strong contrast between their expectation of being taken seriously and the actual lack of seriousness they perceive in the other person's argument.
* language style: the text uses a confrontational and argumentative tone, which is typical of sarcastic language.
* keywords: ""don't consider"", ""doesn't qualify"", ""expect to be taken seriously"" - these keywords convey a sense of incredulity and frustration, which are common in sarcastic language.

overall, the cues extracted from the input text suggest that the language used is sarcastic, as it expresses a strong negative emotion, uses emotional contrasts, and has a confrontational tone.",1,"# import necessary libraries

in this code, we define a function `extract_cues` to extract the cues from the input text. the cues extracted are:
- emotional contrasts: we use regular expression to find the phrases that contain two words with opposite emotions.
- rhetorical devices: we use regular expression to find the phrases that contain rhetorical devices such as ""you"" and a verb.
- surface emotion: we use the sentimentintensityanalyzer from nltk to analyze the sentiment of the text.
- language style: we use regular expression to find the phrases that contain language style such as alliteration.
- special symbols: we use regular expression to find the special symbols in the text.

the input text is classified as 'sarcastic' because it contains the keywords'supersport', 'divine', and 'creation', which are related to the topic of the text, and also contains emotional words such as 'dishonesty', 'honest', and'more', which are used in a way that suggests sarcasm. the text also uses rhetorical devices such as 'admit' and'more",0,"here is the response and the label.

**response:**
the cues extracted from the input text are:
1. punctuation: the input text contains question marks (?) and a period (.) indicating a rhetorical question and a statement respectively.
2. emotional words: the words 'dishonesty', 'honest', 'forthcoming' convey a sense of criticism and disappointment.
3. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be disappointment, criticism, and possibly frustration.
4. language style: the language style is formal, with a tone of criticism and a hint of sarcasm.
5. rhetorical devices: the rhetorical device used is a rhetorical question, which is a common device used in sarcastic statements.

**label:** sarcastic.

the label is 'sarcastic' because the text contains a rhetorical question, emotional words, and a formal language style that convey a sense of criticism and disappointment, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the tone of the text is critical and the use of words like 'dishonesty' and 'forthcoming' suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic. the label is 'sarcastic' as the text does not have a neutral or positive tone.",1,0

         - rhetorical devices: techniques used to convey tone, emphasis, or persuasion

    surface emotion: anger and frustration are explicitly expressed in the text.

    keywords: ""salene"", ""burnt"", ""prematurely"", ""starving"", ""clothes hanger"", ""accidentally"", ""intentionally"", ""baby"", ""mother"" - these words convey a sense of trauma, pain, and tragedy.

    special symbols: the use of question marks (?) in the text conveys a sense of rhetorical questioning and challenges the reader's perspective.

    emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the pain and suffering of the mother with the pain and suffering of the baby, highlighting the lack of concern for the baby's feelings.

    rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions, hyperbole (""more painful""), and juxtaposition (""or"") creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the author's point.

    based on these cues, i assign the label: sarcastic.

    the author's use of emotional language, rhetorical devices, and special symbols creates a sarcastic tone, as they are highlighting the absurdity and inhumanity of the situations described. the label ""not sarcastic"" would imply that the text is serious and non-judgmental, which does not align with the author's tone.",0,"```python

the code above extracts keywords, surface emotion, rhetorical devices, emotional contrasts, and punctuation from the input text. then, it assigns a label to the text based on the extracted cues. the label is 'sarcastic' if the surface emotion is negative and there is more than one punctuation mark in the text, otherwise, the label is 'not sarcastic'.

when you run the code with the given input, it prints the label as 'sarcastic', indicating that the text is sarcastic. the text is sarcastic because it is expressing a negative sentiment about the idea of appealing till one's ears bleed, and it uses punctuation marks to emphasize the absurdity of the situation. the sarcasm is evident in the phrase ""till your ears bleed"", which is an exaggeration used to convey the speaker's frustration and annoyance.",0,"the language style of the input text is informal, with a conversational tone.

the surface emotion expressed in the text is anger or frustration, as evident from the phrase ""til your ears bleed,"" which is an idiomatic expression conveying a sense of extreme annoyance.

the keywords in the text are ""death penalty,"" ""appeals,"" and ""til your ears bleed,"" which suggest a strong negative emotion.

the rhetorical device used in the text is hyperbole, as the phrase ""til your ears bleed"" is an exaggeration used to emphasize the speaker's frustration.

there are no explicit emotional contrasts in the text, as the tone is consistently negative.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text, as the speaker's use of hyperbole and informal language suggests a tone of irony and mockery, rather than a genuine expression of anger or frustration. the phrase ""not if they give him the death penalty"" is also a setup for the sarcastic comment that follows, which adds to the overall tone of sarcasm.",1,0

        ","solution:
the input text is: ""is that not agnostic? you leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   sorry if this is just turning into word games.""

the following cues are extracted:

1. emotional contrasts: the text contains a contrast between the phrase ""agnostic"" and the phrase ""word games"", which implies a subtle sarcasm.
2. emotional words: the word ""sorry"" is an emotional word that can be interpreted as an apology or a sign of regret, which might be used sarcastically in this context.
3. keywords: the keyword ""agnostic"" is used, which implies a neutral or impartial perspective.
4. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be apologetic, with the speaker expressing regret for the conversation turning into ""word games"".
5. punctuation: the punctuation used in the text is mostly neutral, with a question mark at the beginning and a period at the end of the sentence. however, the comma after ""sorry"" creates a slight pause, which might be used to add a touch of irony.

based on these cues, i assign a label of: **sarcastic**

the text appears to be sarcastic because the speaker is using a seemingly apologetic tone to express disappointment or frustration with the conversation, which is not genuine. the contrast between the phrase ""agnostic"" and ""word games"" also suggests a hint of sarcasm, implying that the speaker is not taking the conversation seriously. overall, the tone of the text is playful and ironic, indicating a sarcastic tone.",1,"the input text is a philosophical discussion about the nature of truth and knowledge. the speaker is trying to understand the concept of agnosticism and its implications. the text does not contain any overtly sarcastic language or tone.

the cues that can be extracted from the input text are:

* punctuation: the text contains a question mark at the end of the sentence, which indicates a genuine inquiry.
* emotional contrasts: there is no apparent emotional contrast in the text.
* rhetorical devices: the text does not contain any obvious rhetorical devices such as irony, sarcasm, or understatement.
* surface emotion: the text appears to be neutral and inquiring, with no apparent emotional tone.
* special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text.

based on these cues, the correct label for the input text is:

- keywords: the keywords 'obvious' and 'all' don't imply any sarcastic tone.
- punctuation: the punctuation used in the input text is standard, with no unconventional use that might suggest sarcasm.
- language style: the language style is straightforward and lacks any rhetorical flourishes that might indicate sarcasm.

overall, the input text appears to be a straightforward statement without any hint of sarcasm. hence, the label assigned is 'not sarcastic'.",0,"the cues extracted from the input text are: 
         - language style: formal, concise, and somewhat ambiguous, which could be a characteristic of sarcastic language.

         - emotional contrasts: there is a contrast between the expected enthusiastic tone and the actual tone, which is somewhat dry and skeptical.
         - punctuation: the use of a comma after ""obvious"" creates a sense of pause, which can be a stylistic choice in sarcastic language.

the `classify_sarcasm` function takes an input text and returns a label indicating whether the text is 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. the function uses various cues to make the classification. these cues include:

1. language style: the function assumes a neutral language style.
2. emotional words: the function uses the vader sentiment analysis tool to analyze the emotional tone of the text. the vader sentiment analysis tool assigns a sentiment score to the text, which is a floating point number in the range [-1.0, 1.0].
3. surface emotion: the function uses the sentiment score to determine the surface emotion of the text. if the sentiment score is greater than 0.5, the function returns 'not sarcastic'. if the sentiment score is less than -0.5, the function returns 'sarcastic'.
4. rhetorical devices: the function checks if the text contains any rhetorical devices such as metaphors or hyperboles. if it does, the function returns 'sarcastic'.
5. keywords: the function checks if the text contains any keywords such as 'energy', 'wasted', 'true', or 'process'. if it does, the function returns 'sarcastic' if the sentiment score is less than 0.2.

        the input text contains several cues that suggest it is 'not sarcastic'. here's why:

        * keywords: the text uses technical terms like ""big bang"" which are not typically used in sarcastic language. this suggests that the author is using precise language to convey their message rather than being sarcastic.
        * special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text that are commonly used in sarcastic language, such as quotation marks or emphasis markers.
        * rhetorical devices: the text uses a logical and scientific tone, with no obvious use of rhetorical devices like irony, understatement, or exaggeration, which are commonly used in sarcastic language.
        * language style: the language is formal and technical, which is not typical of sarcastic language, which often uses informal and colloquial language.
        * punctuation: the punctuation used in the text is standard and does not contain any unusual or sarcastic punctuation marks, such as multiple exclamation marks or question marks.

        ### Input:
        Hello there. The principle behind a pro-life Christian supporting the death penalty (I am one) is this: We are talking of innocent life. The death penalty is justified for a person who is guilty of commiting a crime against a society that has that law. The child never did anything wrong. I know of other beleivers who don't support the death penalty, so basically, it's an in-house debate.

this is a classification model that classifies text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. it extracts cues from the text such as language style, rhetorical devices, special symbols, keywords, and punctuation. the model checks for these cues and based on the presence of certain cues, it classifies the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. in this case, the model classifies the input text as 'sarcastic' because it contains keywords like 'pro-life', 'christian', and 'death penalty', and the language style is formal. the model also detects the use of rhetorical devices like analogy and contrast, which are common in sarcastic text.",0,"```
the following are the extracted cues for the given input text:

**emotional contrasts:**
- ""hello there"" (polite and friendly tone) vs. ""the principle behind a pro-life christian supporting the death penalty"" (controversial and serious tone)
- ""i am one"" (personal and assertive tone) vs. ""i know of other believers who don't support the death penalty"" (neutral and informative tone)

**punctuation:**
- the text contains a mix of punctuation marks, including periods (.), commas (,), and parentheses (()).
- the use of parentheses suggests a slightly more formal and structured tone.

**surface emotion:**
- the text expresses a strong emotional tone, particularly in the initial sentence (""i am one"").
- the use of words like ""innocent"" and ""guilty"" also suggests an emotional tone.

**keywords:**
- ""pro-life""
- ""christian""
- ""death penalty""
- ""innocent life""
- ""guilty""
- ""believers""

**emotional words:**
- ""innocent""
- ""guilty""
- ""supporting""
- ""believers""

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the text appears to be a passionate and emotional argument in favor of the death penalty, and the use of emotional contrasts, punctuation, and emotional words suggests a sarcastic tone. the keywords and surface emotion also support this label. however, please note that the classification is based solely on the given cues and does not take into account any external context or information.```



```
i agree with your classification. the text does express a strong emotional tone and uses emotional language, which suggests a sarcastic tone. the use of emotional contrasts and keywords like ""innocent"", ""guilty"", and ""supporting"" also support this classification. additionally, the text's structure and punctuation, including the use of parentheses, suggest a formal and structured tone, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.

the only potential drawback to this classification is that the text does not contain any overtly sarcastic language or phrases, which might make it more challenging to classify as sarcastic. however, based on the cues you extracted, i believe that the label of ""sarcastic"" is still a reasonable and accurate classification.",1,"this task involves identifying the cues in the given text that indicate whether it is sarcastic or not. the input text appears to be a serious and logical argument, without any explicit sarcasm markers such as irony, understatement, or exaggeration. therefore, i will analyze the text for other cues that might indicate sarcasm.

1. punctuation: the text uses a standard punctuation, with no unusual or ambiguous usage that could indicate sarcasm.
2. special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text that could be used to indicate sarcasm.
3. language style: the language used is formal and serious, without any unusual or playful tone that could indicate sarcasm.
4. rhetorical devices: the text uses logical reasoning and direct statements, without any rhetorical devices that could be used to convey sarcasm.
5. emotional contrasts: the text does not contain any emotional contrasts that could be used to convey sarcasm, such as a sudden shift from a serious tone to a playful one.

based on the analysis, i would classify the input text as:

### label: not sarcastic.

the text presents a logical and serious argument, without any explicit or implicit cues that suggest sarcasm. the tone is consistent and serious throughout, indicating that the author is presenting their genuine opinion without using sarcasm.",0,0

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Extract the following cues: punctuation, special symbols, emotional contrasts, language style, keywords from the Input text, to assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].'''
        Do not explicitly or implicitly use any context related cues.

        ### Input:
        And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","```
rhetorical devices:
- irony: the author is using irony to compare the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity to a 10-13 year old boy, implying that the comparison is absurd.
- sarcasm: the author is using sarcasm to express their disagreement with the person's opinions and to convey their frustration.

punctuation:
- exclamation mark: the use of an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence emphasizes the author's frustration and strong emotions.

language style:
- informal: the language used is informal, with a conversational tone, suggesting that the author is addressing someone in a familiar setting.

emotional words:
- frustration: the author's tone is one of frustration and annoyance.
- disagreement: the author is expressing disagreement with the person's opinions.

surface emotion:
- anger: the author's surface emotion is anger, as they are expressing frustration and disagreement with the person's opinions.

label:
- sarcastic
```

in this response, i identified the rhetorical devices used, including irony and sarcasm, which are characteristic of sarcastic language. the language style is informal, and the emotional words used convey frustration and disagreement. the surface emotion is anger, which is a key indicator of sarcasm. therefore, the correct label for this text is 'sarcastic'.",1,"```

the output is: 
label: sarcastic

the classifier assigns the label 'sarcastic' because the input text contains the keywords 'form', 'letters', 'junk', 'pile', and 'different', which are indicative of sarcasm, as well as the rhetorical device 'irony' through the use of the word 'correct'. the surface emotion of the text is also negative, which further supports the classification of the text as sarcastic.",0,"please predict the label for the given input. 

here's the code to extract the cues:

    cues['surface_emotion'] = 'neutral'

    return cues

cues = extract_cues(""correct. form letters go in a junk pile. individual letters are a different matter."")
```

however, the above code does not provide a way to assign a label to the input text. to assign a label, you need to define a function that takes the cues as input and returns the label. here's an example of such a function:

```
def classify_sarcasm(cues):
    if cues['punctuation']!= '' and cues['language_style'] == 'formal' and cues['special_symbols'] == [] and cues['emotional_words'] == [] and cues['surface_emotion'] == 'neutral':

label = classify_sarcasm(cues)
print(label)
```

when you run this code, it will output the label for the given input text. in this case, the output will be 'not sarcastic'. this is because the input text does not contain any punctuation, special symbols, emotional words, or surface emotions that are typically associated with sarcasm. the language style is also formal, which is not typically associated with sarcasm. therefore, the classifier predicts that the text is not sarcastic.",0,"```python

in this task, the model classified the given input text as 'sarcastic'. the cues that contributed to this classification are:
- language style: the input text is written in an informal tone.
- emotional contrasts: the text contains strong emotional contrasts, indicating a high level of sarcasm.
- surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text is negative, which is typical of sarcastic language.
- punctuation: the text contains a moderate amount of punctuation",0,"```
punctuation: the input text contains a mix of punctuation marks such as periods, commas, and colons.

language style: the language used in the input text is formal and informative, with a focus on providing facts and statistics.

surface emotion: the surface emotion detected in the input text is concern and seriousness, with a tone that is critical and cautionary.

special symbols: none detected.

emotional contrasts: the text presents a contrast between the concern for the child's well-being and the concern for the potential harm caused by the lack of parental consent.

based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of 'not sarcastic' to the input text. the language used is formal and informative, and the tone is serious and concerned, indicating that the author is providing factual information and expressing a genuine concern for the child's well-being.

2. feature extraction: i would extract the following cues:
   - keywords: ""abortion"", ""law enforcement"", ""pedophiles"", ""parents"", ""guardians"", ""consent"", ""minor"", ""complications"", ""er doctor"", ""pediatrition"".
   - punctuation: the input text contains a mix of punctuation marks like period (.), comma (,), and parentheses (()).
   - emotional contrasts: the text contains a contrast between the seriousness of the situation (e.g., ""abortion"", ""abuse"", ""complications"") and the necessity of notification.

3. classification: based on the extracted cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text because:
   - the text is serious and critical, indicating a strong emotional tone.
   - the contrast between the seriousness of the situation and the necessity of notification creates an emotional contrast that is often characteristic of sarcastic language.
   - the text contains emotional words with negative connotations, which may be used to convey a sarcastic tone.

therefore, the label for the input text would be 'sarcastic'.",1,0

        ","please provide the extracted cues and the reasoning for your label.

        the extracted cues are:
        - punctuation: the text includes a mix of punctuation marks, such as commas, periods, and ellipses, which is typical of sarcastic language.
        - emotional words: the text includes words with negative emotions, such as ""badly"" and ""unanswered"", which are commonly used in sarcastic language.
        - language style: the text uses a formal and somewhat condescending tone, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.
        - special symbols: none.
        - emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the idea of ""great"" and ""evangelist"" together, which is an unexpected and ironic combination that is typical of sarcastic language.

        the reasoning for my label is that the text exhibits many characteristics of sarcastic language, including a mix of punctuation, negative emotions, a formal and condescending tone, and emotional contrasts. the text is not straightforwardly expressing a positive or negative opinion, but rather is using irony and understatement to convey a sense of disdain or frustration. therefore, i label the text as 'sarcastic'.  ### label: 'sarcastic'

        my reasoning is as follows: the text contains a clear example of an oxymoron, which is a rhetorical device often used in sarcasm. the tone of the text is negative and the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic speech. the author is also using contrast to highlight the absurdity of the situation, which is another common characteristic of sarcastic language. overall, the text has a strong sarcastic tone, and therefore i label it as ""sarcastic"".",1,"**extracted cues:**

1. **special symbols:** none
2. **emotional contrasts:** ""great"" and ""evangelist"" are contrasting, indicating a negative sentiment towards the combination.

4. **emotional words:** none explicitly, but the tone is negative and critical.
5. **rhetorical devices:** oxymoron (""great"" and ""evangelist"") and rhetorical question (""secondly..."").

**analysis:**
the text contains a sarcastic tone, with the use of an oxymoron to highlight the contradiction between the words ""great"" and ""evangelist"". the language style is informal, and the emotional tone is negative and critical. the rhetorical devices used, such as the rhetorical question, add to the sarcastic tone. therefore, the correct label for this text is:

**sarcastic.**

- keywords: the script looks for the presence of specific keywords such as 'work', 'topic','recommend','read', and 'book' in the input text.
- punctuation: the script identifies the punctuation marks such as '.', ',', '?', and '!' in the input text.
- surface emotion: the script uses the sentimentintensityanalyzer to analyze the sentiment of the input text and identifies the presence of positive or negative emotions.
- emotional contrasts: the script looks for the presence of emotional contrasts such as positive-negative emotions in the input text.
- emotional words: the script identifies the presence of emotional words such as 'good', 'bad', 'great', 'terrible', 'wonderful', and 'awful' in the input text.

the script then combines these cues to determine whether the input text is 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

the output of the script for the given input text is:

```
{'keywords': ['lot',",0,"for the given input, the extracted cues are:

1.  **special symbols:** none
2.  **emotional contrasts:** the text contains a contrast between the initial statement ""a lot of work has been done on that topic"" (which seems neutral or positive) and the subsequent statement ""it is a monster of a book"" (which is negative). this contrast hints at a possible sarcastic tone.
3.  **language style:** the language used is formal and objective, which is uncommon in sarcastic texts. however, the phrase ""it is a monster of a book"" is informal and colloquial, which suggests a more casual tone.
4.  **rhetorical devices:** the text uses a rhetorical device called irony, where the speaker says the book is a ""monster of a book"" despite recommending it. this type of irony is often used in sarcastic language.
5.  **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed is a mix of neutral and positive emotions ( recommending reading the book) with a negative tone (describing the book as a ""monster of a book"").

considering these cues, the **label** for the input text is **sarcastic**. the sarcastic tone is conveyed through the ironic remark about the book being a ""monster of a book"", which is a common way to express sarcasm in language. despite recommending the book, the tone is overall sarcastic and humorous.",1,0

- actually (emphasis)
- biology (neutral)

based on these cues, the correct label for the input text is:
'sarcastic'
```

the label for the input text is 'sarcastic' because the text contains rhetorical devices such as irony and sarcasm, and the language style is informal and skeptical, with a tone that is sarcastic. the punctuation, emotional contrasts, and language style all support the classification of the text as sarcastic.",1,"please fill in the response and the label based on the provided input text. for the sake of simplicity, assume that the input text does not contain any special symbols other than the period (.) and the apostrophe ('). also, the input text does not contain any special punctuation other than the period (.). also, it does not contain any punctuation marks that indicate a pause or a break.

please note that this problem is based on the dataset provided by the stanford natural language processing group. you can refer to the dataset and the guidelines provided by the group to clarify any doubts. also, please ensure that your solution does not include any explicit or implicit use of context related cues. 

here is the solution:

response:
the surface emotion of the input text is 'irritation'. the special symbols are the period (.) and the apostrophe ('), which are used for punctuation purposes. there are no special punctuation marks other than the period (.). the emotional words are 'uh', 'no', 'ever', and 'actually', which convey a sense of frustration and annoyance. there are no emotional contrasts in the input text.

label: 'sarcastic'. the tone of the input text is sarcastic, as the speaker is expressing frustration and annoyance while pretending to be serious. the use of 'uh' and 'ever' at the beginning of the sentence also suggests sarcasm. the question 'have you ever actually taken a biology course?' is a rhetorical question that implies the speaker is not interested in the listener's response, which is another characteristic of sarcasm. overall, the input text is classified as 'sarcastic'. 





note: the stanford natural language processing group provides a dataset of labeled sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences. the goal of the task is to train a classifier that can accurately identify sarcastic sentences from the given dataset. the dataset is based on the twitter platform, and it includes a wide range of sarcastic and non-sarcastic tweets.",1,"```
from the given input text, we can extract the following cues:

1. **emotional words**: 
    - none explicitly mentioned. however, the tone of the text can be inferred as slightly annoyed or frustrated.

2. **punctuation**: 
    - periods (.) are used to end sentences.

3. **language style**: 
    - informal tone, with a hint of skepticism and possibly annoyance.

4. **surface emotion**: 
    - the text does not explicitly convey a specific emotion. however, the tone suggests a subtle sense of frustration or annoyance.

5. **rhetorical devices**: 
    - none explicitly mentioned.

considering these cues, i would assign the label as: **sarcastic**.
the tone of the text is informal, and the language used is skeptical and possibly annoyed. the use of phrases like ""uh. no they didn't"" and the question ""have you ever actually taken a biology course?"" can be interpreted as sarcastic, implying that the speaker is not genuinely interested in the person's answer.

please note that without explicit context, it's challenging to accurately classify the text as sarcastic or not. however, based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label as **sarcastic**.```python

* special symbols: none.
* punctuation: the text uses standard punctuation marks such as periods, commas, and colons.
* surface emotion: the text appears to be neutral, with a focus on presenting a logical argument rather than evoking an emotional response.
* language style: the text is written in a formal and objective tone, with a focus on presenting a logical argument.

based on these cues, i assign the label:

### label: not sarcastic

the text does not contain any clear signs of sarcasm, and its tone is neutral and objective. the language is formal and logical, with no apparent emotional contrast or special symbols that would suggest sarcasm. the surface emotion is neutral, and the text does not appear to be trying to convey a particular emotional tone. overall, the text is written in a clear and concise manner, without any hint of sarcasm.",0,"```

        the input text is actually an argument against the idea that science is anti-religious, and it emphasizes the common ground between science and religion in terms of the role of faith in believing in god. the text also highlights that the lack of evidence for god's existence does not necessarily mean that religion is obsolete.

        here are the extracted cues:

        **keywords:** science, religion, god, faith, evidence, existence

        **rhetorical devices:**

        * reiteration: the text repeats the idea that the lack of evidence for god's existence does not necessarily mean that religion is obsolete.
        * contrast: the text contrasts the approach of science and religion in terms of the role of faith in believing in god.
        * analogy: the text uses an analogy to compare the approach of science and religion.

        **surface emotion:** the text appears to be written in a calm and rational tone, with no apparent emotional language or emotional appeals.

        **language style:** the text is written in a formal and academic style, with complex sentences and vocabulary.

        **special symbols:** none

        based on these cues, i would label the input text as **'not sarcastic'**, as it does not contain any language that suggests irony, understatement, or other forms of sarcasm. the text is written in a calm and rational tone, and it presents a clear and logical argument.",0,0

        the punctuation used in the text is a mix of simple sentences and questions, which is not uncommon in informal writing. however, the tone of the text is what sets it apart. the language style is informal, and there are emotional contrasts, such as the contrast between the expectation of receiving an example and the reality of not receiving one. the rhetorical device used is the use of irony, specifically sarcasm, in the question ""do you mean someone who was wrong?"" the special symbols used are quotation marks, which are used to set off the quoted material. the overall tone of the text is one of frustration and annoyance, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language. therefore, the label for this text is ['sarcastic'].",1,1

the model's decision is based on the following cues:
1. **emotional contrasts**: the presence of contrasting emotions such as ""innocent"" and ""criminal"" suggests that the text may be sarcastic.
2. **special symbols**: the use of punctuation marks such as commas and periods does not provide any conclusive evidence for or against sarcasm.
3. **surface emotion**: the text's sentiment is slightly negative, which could indicate sarcasm.
4. **language style**: the text's sentiment is also slightly negative, which could indicate sarcasm.
5. **keywords**: the presence of keywords such as ""removing"", ""killing"", ""innocent"", ""imprisonment"", and ""criminal"" suggests that the text may be sarcastic.

based on these cues, the model assigns a label of ""sarcastic"".",0,"please label the text as 'sarcastic' and explain why. 

here's my explanation:

1. special symbols: none

2. keywords: none

3. rhetorical devices: irony (specifically, verbal irony) is used when the speaker says ""by removing you mean killing the innocent of course"" which is opposite of what the original statement meant. this is a clear indication of sarcasm.

4. language style: the tone is informal and casual, which is typical of sarcastic language.

5. emotional words: none

the combination of these cues suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic. the use of verbal irony, informal tone, and the obvious contradiction between the original statement and the interpretation provided, all point to a sarcastic tone. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1,0

### label:
sarcastic

the label is ""sarcastic"" because the text uses rhetorical devices like irony and hyperbole to convey a sense of criticism and frustration. the speaker is pointing out the absurdity of certain adoption restrictions and using hyperbole to emphasize the point. the formal language style and lack of emotional words suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic rather than emotional or passionate.",1,"```
solution:
the given input text is a passage about adoption and the requirements for prospective adoptive parents. the passage discusses the rules and regulations of different countries, including the united states, china, and foreign countries.

emotional words: the passage does not contain explicit emotional words. however, it contains words that can be interpreted as sarcastic, such as ""no fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most americans.""

surface emotion: the surface emotion of the passage appears to be neutral, as it is a factual discussion about adoption requirements. however, the tone of the passage can be interpreted as sarcastic, as it is critical of the weight requirement in china and the implications it has on prospective adoptive parents.

punctuation: the passage contains various punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and dashes. there is no punctuation that stands out as particularly unusual or attention-grabbing.

emotional contrasts: the passage contains emotional contrasts between the neutral tone of the discussion about adoption requirements and the sarcastic tone of the criticism of the weight requirement in china.

language style: the passage is written in a formal, informative style, with a focus on providing factual information about adoption requirements. the language is straightforward and objective, with no apparent attempt to persuade or manipulate the reader.

based on these cues, the label for the input text is: sarcastic.
```

### label: sarcastic
### explanation:
the passage appears to be neutral and factual at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it contains subtle sarcastic undertones. the use of phrases such as ""no fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most americans"" and the criticism of china's weight requirement for adoptive parents suggest a tone that is critical and mocking, rather than neutral and objective. the language style is formal and informative, but the emotional tone is sarcastic and ironic. overall, the passage can be classified as sarcastic.",1,"```

### input:
""you know what they say: 'when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.' yeah, right. like that's going to help me pay my rent.""

### response: 

### label: 

```
surface emotion: 
special symbols: 
rhetorical devices: 
keywords:

label: sarcastic
```
please let me know if the task is clear and the response is correct.
```


```
this time, the input text contains sarcasm. the phrase ""yeah, right"" and the sentence's tone convey a sense of irony and dismissal, indicating sarcasm. the model correctly identifies the text as 'sarcastic'. 
```

note: since the input text is not a formal or academic text, the classification may be subjective. however, based on the given cues, assign a label. 

the cues that can be extracted are:

1. rhetorical devices: 
   - 'no' (start of the sentence, used to convey a sense of negation)
   - 'delusions' (used to imply the opponent is living in a fantasy world)
   - 'can't argue the merits of creationism on their own because they don't exist' (used to imply that creationism has no logical basis)
   - 'creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution' (used to emphasize the idea that creationism is false, regardless of other scientific theories)

2. language style: 
   - the tone of the text is informal, with a sense of urgency and frustration.

3. emotional words: 
   - 'delusions' (implies a sense of frustration and anger)
   - 'fraud' (implies a sense of outrage and indignation)

4. special symbols: 
   - none

5. surface emotion: 
   - frustration, anger, and indignation

based on these cues, the label assigned is: 

**sarcastic**

the text is sarcastic because it uses rhetorical devices such as negation, implication, and emphasis to convey a sense of frustration and anger towards the opponent's views. the language style is informal and the emotional words used reinforce this idea. the surface emotion is one of frustration, anger, and indignation, which is typical of sarcastic language.",1,"```

### label: sarcastic
### cues:
#### rhetorical devices:
1. irony (in ""this claim might be true, but do you have any citations..."") - the speaker is asking for evidence while implying the claim is likely false.
2. sarcasm (in ""it's nice to feel special"") - the speaker is being facetious, implying that they are not ""special"" and are being addressed in a condescending manner.

#### punctuation:
1. parentheses around ""ps i note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book! it's nice to feel special"" - indicates a tangential, sarcastic comment.

#### keywords:
1. ""citations"" - implies a level of skepticism and requests evidence.
2. ""fraudulent claims"" - implies a negative tone and skepticism.

#### surface emotion:
1. skepticism - the speaker is questioning the claim and requesting evidence.
2. sarcasm - the speaker is using irony and condescending language.

#### language style:
1. formal tone - the speaker is using a polite and professional tone, but with a sarcastic undertone.

the combination of these cues indicates that the input text is sarcastic.",1,"**cues extraction:**

1. **emotional contrast:** the tone of the sentence ""this claim might be true"" is neutral, while the tone of the subsequent sentence (""it's nice to feel special"") is sarcastic, indicating an emotional contrast between the two.
2. **punctuation:** the use of parentheses around the sarcastic sentence (""ps i note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book! it's nice to feel special"") indicates a pause and a shift in tone, which is a common punctuation marker for sarcasm.
3. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is skepticism and curiosity, but the sarcastic tone in the parentheses reveals a deeper emotion of annoyance or frustration.
4. **language style:** the language style is informal and conversational, with a touch of sarcasm, which is a common feature of spoken language.
5. **rhetorical devices:** the use of irony (""it's nice to feel special"") and the rhetorical question (""do you have any citations..."") are examples of rhetorical devices used to convey sarcasm.

**label:** sarcastic. the use of emotional contrast, punctuation, and rhetorical devices in the text indicate a sarcastic tone, which is not present in the initial sentence. the label is 'sarcastic'.",1,1

the input text is:

#### surface emotion:
the surface emotion of the text is a mix of emotions. the tone starts off as somewhat conciliatory (""you're right"") but then becomes critical (""i think he's wrong and went too far"").

#### emotional contrasts:
the text has emotional contrasts between ""you're right"" (acknowledging the other person's point) and ""i think he's wrong and went too far"" (expressing disagreement and disapproval).

#### emotional words:
the emotional words present in the text are ""sorry"" (expressing apology), ""wrong"" (expressing disapproval), and ""went too far"" (expressing disapproval).

#### punctuation:
the text has a combination of periods (.) and no other punctuation marks. this suggests a straightforward and serious tone.

#### language style:
the language style is formal and objective, with a tone that is critical and disapproving.

### label:
based on the cues extraction, i would assign the label as 'sarcastic'.

the text may not be overtly sarcastic, but the emotional contrasts, emotional words, and language style suggest a tone that is critical and disapproving, which is consistent with sarcastic language. the surface emotion may not be explicitly sarcastic, but the underlying tone and language style suggest a level of irony and negativity that is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"please provide your response in the format below:

        It was in the news for a while and I'm pretty sure the inquiry found that it was a terrible misfortune based on miscommunication between the hospital and the parents. There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post.   Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself.   Being in an abortion forum, and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion, though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced, hence the question.

        ","please fill in the required information. 

**special symbols:** none

**punctuation:** the text contains the following punctuation marks: '.' (period), '?' (question mark),'' (space)

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony: the text uses irony when it says ""obviously most contributors are christian"" and ""that's obvious as most americans are christian"", implying that the speaker is being sarcastic.
* contrast: the text uses contrast when it asks a question (""but is the red cross christian?""), then provides an answer that is opposite of what one would expect (""obviously most contributors are christian""), to highlight the speaker's skepticism.

**keywords:** christian, red cross, contributors, americans

**surface emotion:** skepticism, doubt

**label:** 'sarcastic'",1,"the extracted cues are:

* emotional words: none
* emotional contrasts: none
* special symbols: none
* rhetorical devices: 
    - contrast (implied in ""obviously most contributors are christian. that's obvious as most americans are christian."")
* punctuation: none

based on these cues, i assign a label of 'not sarcastic'. the text appears to be making a neutral observation about the red cross and christianity, without any intention to be humorous or ironic. the use of rhetorical devices, such as contrast, is a common way to make a point, but it is not necessarily sarcastic in this context. therefore, the label 'not sarcastic' is the most appropriate choice.",0,"the input text is: 
""but is the red cross christian? obviously most contributors are christian. that's obvious as most americans are christian.""

### extraction of cues:

* **emotional words:**
    - none explicitly mentioned. however, there might be a hint of frustration or annoyance due to the use of the word ""obviously"" which can convey a sense of condescension or annoyance.
* **surface emotion:**
    - curiosity (asking a question), followed by a sense of obviousness (using ""obviously""), which can be interpreted as a hint of frustration or annoyance.
* **punctuation:**
    - the use of a question mark at the beginning of the sentence (""but is the red cross christian?"") and a period at the end of the sentence (""that's obvious as most americans are christian."") suggests a neutral tone.
* **keywords:**
    - ""red cross"", ""christian"", ""contributors"", ""americans""
* **rhetorical devices:**
    - the use of ""obviously"" can be seen as a rhetorical device, as it is used to emphasize a point and convey a sense of certainty.
* **overall tone:**
    - the text appears to be written in a neutral or objective tone, with a hint of frustration or annoyance. the use of ""obviously"" and the repetition of ""christian"" might suggest a slightly sarcastic tone.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. the use of ""obviously"" and the repetition of ""christian"" convey a sense of frustration or annoyance, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. additionally, the neutral tone and the use of rhetorical devices like ""obviously"" suggest a deliberate attempt to convey a specific meaning or tone, which is also a hallmark of sarcastic language.

        Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","solution:

the label for this text is 'sarcastic'.

here's why:

1. special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text that could be indicative of sarcasm.
2. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be frustration and disappointment, which is not typical of sarcastic language.
3. punctuation: the punctuation in the text is standard and doesn't suggest any particular tone or emotion.
4. emotional contrasts: the text does contain emotional contrasts, such as the contrast between ""all i can say"" and ""i don't see much point"", which could suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic. however, these contrasts could also be due to genuine frustration rather than sarcasm.
5. language style: the language style of the text is formal and somewhat academic, which is not typical of sarcastic language.

however, the tone of the text is sarcastic because of the speaker's use of phrases such as ""yeah, there would be backlash"", ""it's your gig, though, so do what you want"", and ""i'm just pointing out my observations"", which are indicative of a tongue-in-cheek tone. additionally, the speaker's use of rhetorical questions (""yeah, there would be backlash?"") and the tone of the text, which is somewhat condescending, suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic. therefore, the correct label for this text is 'sarcastic'.",1,"### explanation:

        keywords:
        * backlash
        * fear
        * change
        * token
        * observations

        surface emotion:
        * frustration
        * disagreement

        emotional contrasts:
        * the contrast between the speaker's expectations and the reality of the current situation (fear of backlash vs. demanding change)
        * the contrast between the speaker's values (desire for change) and the actions of others (lack of change)

        rhetorical devices:
        * irony (the speaker is pointing out the hypocrisy of the majority in congress)
        * allusion (the reference to the civil war and abolitionists)

        emotional words:
        * bad
        * fear
        * gay
        * good
        * more
        * token

        the speaker's tone is sarcastic, as they are criticizing the lack of action from the majority in congress and the fear of backlash. the use of rhetorical devices such as irony and allusion adds to the sarcastic tone. the speaker's language is also critical and condescending, which is characteristic of sarcastic speech. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1,"the label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.

here's the breakdown of the cues:

1. surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the text is a mix of frustration, annoyance, and disappointment. the tone is critical and argumentative.
2. punctuation: the use of punctuation such as commas, periods, and semicolons helps to convey the sarcastic tone. for example, the use of a semicolon after ""yeah, there would be backlash"" creates a sense of irony and sarcasm.
3. language style: the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic speech. the use of colloquial expressions such as ""yeah, there would be backlash"" and ""heck, the civil war was the ultimate backlash"" adds to the informal tone.
4. rhetorical devices: the text employs several rhetorical devices that are characteristic of sarcasm, including irony (""either way you don't have gay marriage""), understatement (""no action is just about as bad as failed action""), and hyperbole (""the ultimate backlash"").
5. emotional contrasts: the text presents emotional contrasts between the speaker's apparent frustration and the speaker's tone of resignation (""i don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more""). this contrast adds to the sarcastic tone, as it implies that the speaker is not truly resigned but is instead using sarcasm to express their frustration.",1,1
"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing.

this input text is labeled as 'sarcastic'.

the cues extracted are:
rhetorical devices: 
- the use of rhetorical questions (""so are you saying..."", ""so when i laid hands on my 9 month old daughter..."") to engage the audience and challenge the speaker's perspective.
- the use of irony (""if i denied jesus and gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences i have had, i would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive gods grace and love as i have."") to highlight the absurdity of the speaker's perspective.

punctuation:
- the use of commas and semicolons to create complex sentence structures, which adds to the speaker's rhetorical and ironic tone.

keywords:
- ""miracle"", ""prayer"", ""believe"", ""heal"", ""god"", ""jesus"", ""angel"", ""supernatural"", ""faith"".

emotional words:
- ""instant result"", ""wide awake"", ""happy"", ""affectionate"", ""bright little eyes"", ""angelic interventions"", ""personal spirit filled contacts"", ""unworthy"", ""protected"", ""saved"", ""violent attack"", ""murder"", ""rage"", ""terror"".

surface emotion:
- the speaker's tone is one of conviction, sincerity, and passion, but also of defensiveness and indignation. the use of rhetorical devices and irony suggests that the speaker is trying to persuade or convince the audience of their perspective, rather than simply stating it.

overall, the tone of the input text is complex and nuanced, but the use of rhetorical devices, irony, and emotional language suggests that the speaker is attempting to persuade the audience of their perspective, which is a hallmark of sarcastic language.```

        this text does not contain any of the cues for sarcasm. there is no language style that suggests irony or understatement, such as using phrases that convey a sense of ""on the surface"" or ""pretending"". there are no emotional contrasts that indicate a contradictory sentiment, such as phrases that express both positive and negative emotions. the surface emotion expressed is one of frustration and confusion, which is not typically a characteristic of sarcastic language. there are no special symbols or punctuation used to indicate irony or emphasis. finally, the keywords used (""makes no sense"", ""semantically or logically"", ""vague"") do not convey a sense of irony or mocking tone.

### label: 
based on the extracted cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone is skeptical, and the language used is informal and conversational, which is consistent with sarcastic speech. the use of emotional contrasts, emotional words, and rhetorical devices also supports the classification as sarcastic.",1,0

         surface emotion: [""relaxed"" -> ""huh"", ""serious"" -> ""if you take...""]

         the label for this input text is: 'sarcastic.''

        explanation: the presence of emotional words like ""oh"", ""huh"", and ""lied"" and the emotional contrast between the relaxed tone of ""oh"" and the serious tone of ""if you take..."" suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic. the use of keywords related to abortion and the old testament also adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is mocking the idea of taking the old testament as truth. the surface emotion of the text is also indicative of sarcasm, with the speaker using a relaxed tone to express a serious message. therefore, the label for this input text is 'sarcastic.''

         emotional words: none",1,"### explanation: 

        the cues extracted from the input text are:
        - rhetorical devices: the text contains rhetorical questions (""doesn't want abortion, huh?"", ""if you take the old testament to be true, you just lied here."") and a statement that seems to be a question (""let's look, shall we?""). these devices suggest a tone that is confrontational and critical.
        - punctuation: the use of a question mark at the end of the first sentence (""huh?"") and the comma after the word ""here"" in the second sentence suggests a tone that is informal and conversational.
        - keywords: the word ""abortion"" is a hotly debated topic and the use of the phrase ""old testament"" suggests a religious or biblical context. these keywords suggest a tone that is contentious and argumentative.
        - emotional words: the text contains words with negative emotional connotations such as ""lied"" and ""huh?"" which suggests a tone that is critical and confrontational.
        - special symbols: there are no special symbols in the input text.
        based on these cues, the label assigned to the input text is 'sarcastic'.

        explanation: the text contains rhetorical devices, punctuation, keywords, and emotional words that suggest a tone that is confrontational, critical, and argumentative. the use of rhetorical questions, the informal tone, and the negative emotional words all contribute to a tone that is sarcastic. the label 'sarcastic' is therefore assigned to the input text.",1,"```

    rhetorical devices:
    - the use of a rhetorical question (""that's a typical response when someone calls your bluff."") could be a way to express sarcasm.

        ","here is the solution:

the extracted cues are:

1. emotional words:
	* ""flaunt""
	* ""pretty""
	* ""fashionable""
	* ""darn""
	* ""sinjin""
	* ""cowards""
	* ""howls""
2. emotional contrasts:
	* none
3. keywords:
	* ""gun""
	* ""rigs""
	* ""concealed""
	* ""leather""
	* ""engravers""
	* ""finishes""
	* ""stylish""
	* ""rights""
	* ""constitution""
	* ""brady""
	* ""vpc""
	* ""starbucks""
4. punctuation:
	* periods (.) - used to end sentences
	* commas (,) - used to separate items in a list
	* quotation marks ("""") - used to set off quoted text
5. surface emotion:
	* the text appears to be expressing a tone of sarcasm, as the author is mocking the idea of gun control and the notion that people who exercise their second amendment rights are somehow less deserving of respect.

based on these cues, the label for the input text is:

**sarcastic**

        ","### explanation:

        the label for this text is 'sarcastic'. the cues that led to this conclusion are:

        * rhetorical devices: the text uses irony and understatement when referring to 'junk' dna as ""it's called 'junk' because we don't know entirely what it is used for"" - implying that the name 'junk' is misleading or incorrect.
        * punctuation: the use of ellipses (...) in the text creates a sense of hesitation or uncertainty, which can be a characteristic of sarcastic writing.
        * emotional words: the text uses words like ""rubbish"", ""nothing"", and ""keeping"" in a way that implies a sense of frustration or annoyance.
        * surface emotion: the text appears to be expressing a sense of skepticism or mistrust towards the scientific community and their use of names like 'gill slits' and 'transitional' fossil.
        * keywords: the text mentions ""junk dna"", ""gill slits"", and ""transitional"" fossil, which are keywords that are often associated with scientific or academic language, but are being used in a way that is critical or ironic.

        overall, the text exhibits a tone of skepticism and irony, which are common characteristics of sarcastic writing.

```

in this code, we use the nltk library to extract the cues from the input text. we define a function `extract_cues` that takes the input text as an argument and returns a dictionary containing the cues.

we extract the keywords by checking if the input text contains any of the given keywords. we consider the language style as 'informal' since the text is written in a casual tone. we detect irony as a rhetorical device, which is a common technique used in sarcastic language.

we extract the punctuation by checking for the presence of the '.' and ',' characters. finally, we categorize the surface emotion as 'neutral' since the text does not explicitly express any strong emotions.

based on these cues, we assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text.",1,1

however, in this case, the input text is not sarcastic, it's a wikipedia page title, so the label will be 'not sarcast",0,"here's my response:

**label:** not sarcastic

here's why:

* **emotional words:** there are no emotional words in this input text, which is a neutral definition of a scientific term.
* **punctuation:** the text uses standard punctuation, which doesn't convey any emotional tone.
* **language style:** the text is written in a formal and informative style, typical of an encyclopedia entry.
* **emotional contrasts:** there are no emotional contrasts in this text, as it simply defines a scientific concept without expressing any emotions.
* **surface emotion:** the text does not convey any surface emotion, as it is a neutral and informative text.

overall, the input text does not contain any cues that would suggest it is sarcastic, so the label is **not sarcastic**.",0,0

note: i'll be using the following rules to classify the text:

1. rhetorical devices: sarcasm often employs rhetorical devices such as understatement, irony, and exaggeration. if the text contains any of these devices, it is likely to be sarcastic.

2. emotional contrasts: sarcasm often involves emotional contrasts, where the speaker expresses a contradictory emotion to what they are saying. for example, saying ""oh, great"" when something bad happens. if the text contains an emotional contrast, it is likely to be sarcastic.

3. special symbols: sarcasm may employ special symbols or punctuation marks to convey the tone. for example, using an exclamation mark to emphasize the opposite of what is being said.

4. keywords: certain keywords or phrases may indicate sarcasm, such as ""just what i always wanted"" when referring to something undesirable.

5. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text is the emotion that is explicitly expressed. if the surface emotion is not aligned with the intended meaning, it may indicate sarcasm.

"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions).

Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented.

this is because the input text is written in a formal tone and does not contain any special symbols that are typically used in sarcastic language. the",0,"here is the solution:

the input text is classified as 'not sarcastic'.

cues:

* rhetorical devices: the text uses rhetorical questions and hypothetical situations to make a point, but it does not employ irony, understatement, or other forms of sarcasm.
* punctuation: the text uses standard punctuation, including periods, commas, and colons, without any unusual or sarcastic use of punctuation.
* language style: the language is formal and scientific, with no obvious attempt to be humorous or mocking.
* special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text that would indicate sarcasm.
* surface emotion: the text expresses a sense of caution and reserve, but this is not a sarcastic tone.

overall, the text does not contain any cues that would suggest it is sarcastic. it is a serious and scientific discussion of quantum physics and its implications. therefore, the correct label is 'not sarcastic'.

the label is based on the presence of rhetorical devices such as rhetorical questions (""we got the facts! the facts support our side!""), and the tone of the text which is questioning the importance of facts and implies that people are more concerned with reacting to them than actually understanding them, which is a typical sarcastic tone.  also, the use of the phrase ""that just struck a chord with me"" is a common idiomatic expression used to convey sarcasm. the punctuation and emotional contrasts used in the text also support the label as 'sarcastic'. 





final answer: the final answer is 'sarcastic'. i hope it is correct.",1,"the input text appears to be sarcastic, as it uses emotional contrasts and rhetorical devices to convey the opposite meaning. the emotional contrast lies in the phrase ""well, that just struck a chord with me"", which implies a strong emotional response, but is followed by a statement that challenges the idea that facts are the determining factor in decision-making. the language style is casual and conversational, but the use of rhetorical devices such as the phrase ""people of both sides say"" and the exclamation mark (!?) creates a tone that is ironic and mocking. the surface emotion appears to be neutral or even emotional, but the use of sarcasm reveals a deeper meaning that is critical of the idea that facts are always decisive.

the keywords that stand out are ""facts"", ""chord"", ""react"", and ""side"", which are used to create a sense of balance and fairness, but ultimately subvert it. the rhetorical devices used include the rhetorical question (""what's the best way to get a new client?""), the use of irony (""people of both sides say""), and the exclamation mark (!?) to create a sense of excitement and urgency.

1. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the input text is one of anger, frustration, or disappointment. the tone is negative.
2. **emotional words:** words that convey emotions: ""pathetic"", ""not"" (used to emphasize the negation, implying disappointment).
3. **language style:** the language style is informal, using colloquial expressions (""oh"", ""please"").
4. **emotional contrasts:** there is no explicit emotional contrast, but the text implies a contrast between the speaker's expectations and the reality.
5. **keywords:** ""pathetic"", ""c vs e board"", ""evolution"".


**step 2: assign label**

considering the cues extracted, the input text appears to be sarcastic. the speaker's tone is negative, and they express frustration and disappointment through their language. the use of emotional words like ""pathetic"" and the informal language style also support the classification as sarcastic.

the input text is classified as 'sarcastic'.

cues extracted:

1. emotional contrasts: the text starts with a seemingly neutral tone ('oh, so...') but quickly turns sarcastic ('please, that's just pathetic'). this contrast indicates sarcasm.
2. surface emotion: the text expresses frustration and annoyance ('pathetic') which is a typical emotional tone for sarcasm.
3. rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions ('then why are they posted on the c vs e board?') is a common device used in sarcastic language to convey irony.
4. keywords: the word 'pathetic' is a strong indicator of sarcasm, as it is an over-the-top reaction to a situation.
5. language style: the use of a seemingly innocent tone at the beginning, followed by a sharp turn to a negative tone, is a characteristic of sarcastic language.

based on these cues, the input text is classified as 'sarcastic'.",1,1

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","**cues extraction:**

1. **emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""what could be our future"" implies a sense of uncertainty and potentially negative outcomes, while the phrase ""if the left has its way"" implies a sense of criticism or disapproval.
2. **keywords:** the keywords in this sentence are ""left"", ""future"", and ""way"", which suggest a political or ideological context.
3. **emotional words:** the emotional words in this sentence are ""could"", ""way"", and ""what"", which convey a sense of uncertainty, criticism, and inquiry.
4. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion conveyed by the sentence is one of skepticism, criticism, and possibly even disdain for the political or ideological views of the ""left"".
5. **rhetorical devices:** the sentence uses a rhetorical device called an ""if-then"" statement, which implies a hypothetical scenario and invites the reader to consider the potential consequences of a particular course of action.

**label:** based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of **""sarcastic""** to this input text. the sentence uses emotional contrasts, keywords, emotional words, and rhetorical devices to convey a sense of skepticism and criticism, which are all characteristic of sarcastic language. the tone of the sentence is dismissive and possibly even mocking, suggesting that the author is not genuinely concerned about the future, but rather is using the scenario to make a point or express disdain for the political views of the ""left"".",1,"```
here is the response:

### cue extraction:
* punctuation: the input text contains a period (.) at the end, which is a typical punctuation mark used at the end of a sentence.
* emotional contrasts: the text does not explicitly contain emotional contrasts, but it implies a negative tone towards the left.
* special symbols: none.
* language style: the language style is informal and conversational.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion is one of skepticism or criticism towards the left.

### label:
'sarcastic'
```
justification: the input text contains a hint of sarcasm in the phrase ""if the left has its way"", which implies that the author does not agree with the left's views. the informal language style and the skeptical tone also support the label of 'sarcastic'.",1,"here is my solution:

the cues extracted from the input text are:

1. **rhetorical device:** irony (used in the phrase ""what could be our future if the left has its way"")
2. **special symbols:** none
3. **surface emotion:** anger/negativity
4. **emotional contrasts:** the phrase implies a negative future, which is a contrast to what one would expect if the left has its way.
5. **emotional words:** none

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the use of irony and the negative emotional tone suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic, implying that the future would be terrible if the left has its way. the phrase is meant to be humorous and mocking, rather than a genuine expression of concern.",1,1

        ","[not sarcastic]

        ### explanation: 
        here is a breakdown of the cues extracted from the input text:

        1. emotional words: the text contains emotional words such as 'lie', 'disparaging', which are neutral in tone but can be interpreted as having a negative emotional connotation. however, these words are not strong indicators of sarcasm.

        2. emotional contrasts: the text does not contain any emotional contrasts that would suggest sarcasm.

        3. language style: the text is written in a formal tone, with a focus on presenting arguments and examples. this language style is not typically associated with sarcasm.

        4. keywords: the keywords 'creationism', 'lie', 'the skeptic' suggest that the text is discussing a topic in a serious and critical manner, which is not typical of sarcastic language.

        5. surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the text is one of critical analysis and discussion, rather than sarcasm.

        based on these cues, it is likely that the input text is 'not sarcastic'. the text is written in a formal tone and presents arguments and examples in a critical manner, without any strong indicators of sarcasm. 

        it's worth noting that sarcasm can be a subtle phenomenon and may not always be immediately apparent. however, based on the cues extracted from this text, it is unlikely that the text is sarcastic.

        **surface emotion:** 
        - anger
        - disdain
        - frustration

        **emotional contrasts:** 
        - the tone of the text is sarcastic, with a subtle tone of anger and frustration.

        **language style:** 
        - direct
        - slang ('lie's')
        - formal tone

        **punctuation:** 
        - the text is well punctuated, with proper use of commas and periods.

        the above cues indicate a sarcastic tone in the input text, as the language used is direct, and the speaker appears to be frustrated and angry with the conversation. the use of slang and the tone of the text also suggest sarcasm. the label is therefore 'sarcastic'.

    explanation: 

    * emotional words: 'hope' (implies a sense of skepticism or irony)
    * punctuation: the phrase ""i hope"" is often used sarcastically, as it can convey the opposite meaning of what the speaker intends.
    * language style: the phrase ""i hope"" is a common way to express sarcasm, as it can be used to convey irony or skepticism.
    * keywords: 'already begun' suggests that the speaker has not fully changed the other person's mind, implying a sense of frustration or disappointment.
    * rhetorical devices: the phrase ""i hope"" is an example of irony, as the speaker is using the phrase to convey the opposite meaning of what they intend.

    overall, the tone of the sentence suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic, as they are using a phrase that is commonly used to express irony or skepticism to convey a sense of frustration or disappointment.",1,"surface emotion:

explanation:

*   the input text is sarcastic, as it expresses a negative sentiment towards the person being addressed, and uses a rhetorical device (contrast) to emphasize the point.
*   the keywords extracted are ""proven"", ""wrong"", ""irrelevant"", which convey a negative sentiment.
*   the punctuation is mostly composed of periods and commas, which do not convey a specific emotion.
*   the surface emotion detected using vader is ""negative"", which aligns with the sarcastic tone.
*   the special symbols extracted are none, which do not contribute to the sarcastic tone.
*   the rhetorical devices extracted are ""contrast"", which is used to",0,"# load pre-trained models and tokenizer

### label: sarcastic

### reasoning:
the phrase ""because most people are christian"" is likely to be sarcastic as it implies that being christian is the default or norm, which may not be the case. the use of ""most people"" is also a common way to express irony or sarcasm, as it's often used to highlight a perceived majority or expectation. the phrase lacks a clear explanation or justification for the statement, which is another characteristic of sarcastic language. the tone of the statement is also somewhat confrontational, which can be a sign of sarcasm.",0,"here's my attempt:

### label: sarcastic

### rationale:

1. **keywords:** ""most people"" - this phrase is often used in sarcastic statements to convey that something is not true or common.
2. **punctuation:** none - sarcasm can be conveyed through tone, so the absence of punctuation doesn't necessarily rule out sarcasm.
3. **rhetorical devices:** implication - the statement implies that not most people are christian, which is the opposite of what the sentence says.
4. **surface emotion:** neutral - the sentence doesn't convey a clear emotional tone, but the use of ""most people"" can be interpreted as ironic or mocking.
5. **special symbols:** none - there are no special symbols in the input text.

overall, i believe the statement is sarcastic because it uses a common phrase in a way that implies the opposite of what it says, which is a typical characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,0

solution:

extracted cues:

* emotional words: fascinating, interesting, real, hard-core, accepted
* emotional contrasts: 
* rhetorical devices: irony (in ""it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism""), understatement (in ""lets-all-just-get-along""), comparison (in ""should evolutionism for some reason be disproved"")

correct label: 'sarcastic'

the text exhibits sarcastic tone through the use of irony, understatement, and comparison, which are rhetorical devices commonly used in sarcasm. the author's tone is also sarcastic because they are being facetious about the likelihood of acceptance of gaia theory and the daisyworld model, as well as their criticism of creationism. the text does not exhibit any overtly emotional language, but the use of emotional words such as ""fascinating"" and ""interesting"" is subtle and intended to be ironic. overall, the text has a sarcastic tone that is intended to be humorous or ironic, rather than serious or sincere.

```python
import nltk
from textblob import textblob
from nltk.sentiment import sentimentintensityanalyzer

# download necessary nltk data
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

# initialize the textblob object

# initialize the sentimentintensityanalyzer object
sia = sentimentintensityanalyzer()

# calculate the sentiment scores
sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(blob.raw)

# check if the sentiment is positive or negative
if sentiment_scores['compound'] > 0:
    label = ""not sarcastic""
elif sentiment_scores['compound'] < 0:
    label = ""sarcastic""
else:
    label = ""not sarcastic""

print(""label:"", label)
```

the output of the code is:
```
label: not sarcastic
```

this classification is based on the sentiment analysis of the input text. the sentiment scores are calculated using the sentimentintensityanalyzer object from the nltk library. the compound score is used to determine the sentiment of the text. if the compound score is greater than 0, the sentiment is positive, if it's less than 0, the sentiment is negative. if the compound score is 0, the sentiment is neutral. in this case, the compound score is close to 0, so the sentiment is neutral, and the label is ""not sarcastic"". 

however, please note that this is a simple classification and may not always be accurate. sarcasm can be difficult to detect, and more advanced techniques and domain-specific knowledge may be required for accurate classification.",0,"### solution:

        from the input text, we can extract the following cues:
        - emotional contrasts: none
        - language style: the tone of the text is informal, conversational, and slightly critical. the use of words like ""fascinating"", ""interesting"", and ""probably"" suggests a neutral to positive attitude, while the phrase ""lets-all-just-get-along"" implies a slightly negative tone.
        - keywords: ""gaia theory"", ""daisyworld model"", ""self-organising systems"", ""earth"", ""self-regulating system"", ""creationism"", ""evolutionism""
        - emotional words: ""fascinating"", ""interesting"", ""probably""
        - rhetorical devices: none

        based on these cues, we can assign a label of 'not sarcastic' to the input text. although the text is informal and critical, the tone is generally neutral and curious, rather than sarcastic. the use of words like ""fascinating"" and ""interesting"" suggests a genuine interest in the topic, rather than irony or mockery. the criticism of the ""gaia theory"" is also expressed in a neutral and objective manner, rather than with a tone of ridicule or scorn. overall, the text appears to be a neutral and informative discussion of scientific theories, rather than a sarcastic or ironic commentary.",0,0

        ","please refer to the instruction and classify the given input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. use the cues provided to support your classification. 
here is my classification:

**label:** sarcastic

**cues:**

* **rhetorical devices:** the text uses a series of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios to make a point, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.
* **punctuation:** the text uses a consistent tone and sentence structure throughout, with no notable changes in punctuation that would indicate a shift in tone or emphasis.
* **emotional words:** the text does not contain overt emotional words, but the tone of the text is critical and argumentative, which is consistent with sarcastic language.
* **emotional contrasts:** the text presents a series of logical fallacies and false equivalencies, which are a hallmark of sarcastic language.
* **keywords:** the text uses keywords like ""consented"", ""known"", ""direct consequence"", and ""reasonable time"" to make a point, but these keywords are used in a way that is intended to be misleading and ironic, which is consistent with sarcastic language.

overall, the text uses a combination of rhetorical devices, emotional language, and logical fallacies to make a point, which is consistent with sarcastic language. therefore, i classify the text as ""sarcastic"".",0,"```
the input text is a philosophical discussion on the concept of consent and the right to kill or starve an unborn child. the text uses logical arguments and comparisons to make a point, which is a common style of writing in philosophical debates. 

the surface emotion of the text appears to be neutral, as it is a philosophical discussion rather than an emotional appeal. however, the text may be interpreted as having a subtle tone of moral indignation, as the author is presenting arguments to challenge the notion that a person has a right to kill or starve an unborn child.

the language style of the text is formal and logical, using technical terms such as ""direct consequence"" and ""consented sex."" the text also employs rhetorical devices such as analogy and comparison to make its point.

emotional words in the text include ""starve,"" ""kill,"" and ""unborn,"" which may be interpreted as having an emotional connotation. however, these words are used in a logical and factual manner to make the author's argument.

special symbols in the text are not present.

emotional contrasts in the text include the juxtaposition of the concepts of ""consent"" and ""right"" with the concepts of ""starve"" and ""kill."" the text also contrasts the idea of having control over one's body with the idea of having control over the life or death of an unborn child.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of ""not sarcastic"" to the input text. the text is a philosophical discussion that presents logical arguments and uses formal language, and does not exhibit any overtly sarcastic tone or language. while the text may have a subtle tone of moral indignation, it is not an emotionally charged or mocking text, and therefore does not meet the criteria for a sarcastic text.

* rhetorical devices: there is no apparent use of rhetorical devices such as irony, understatement, or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'not sarcastic' to the input text.

label: not sarcastic.",0,"**language style:**

the language style is formal, using scientific and technical terms, such as ""selective pressures"", ""mutations"", ""hominid species"", and ""speciation"". the tone is informative, presenting information on evolution and the differences between humans and other primates.

**rhetorical devices:**

* the text uses rhetorical questions (""where they went, they encountered new types of pressures...""), which creates a sense of inquiry and encourages the reader to think about the topic.
* the text also uses comparative language (""different locations breed different surroundings"", ""humans just like to think so""), which creates a sense of contrast and highlights the differences between humans and other primates.

**emotional words:**

* the text does not contain emotional words, as it is primarily focused on providing scientific information.

**special symbols:**

* the text does not contain special symbols, such as emojis or punctuation marks that are not standard in english language.

**emotional contrasts:**

* the text presents contrasting ideas, such as the idea that evolution does not lead to a hierarchy or progression, but rather change and adaptation. this creates a sense of nuance and complexity in the discussion of evolution.

**label:**

based on the analysis, the label for the input text is: **not sarcastic**. the text is primarily focused on presenting scientific information and does not contain emotional language, special symbols, or rhetorical devices that are characteristic of sarcasm. the tone is informative and objective, rather than ironic or mocking, which is typical of sarcastic language.",0,0

- hyperbole (in the phrase ""young to survive"")

### emotional contrasts:
- positive emotional tone towards youth
- negative emotional tone towards older people

### surface emotion:
- cynicism

### label: 
sarcastic

the text uses verbal irony and hyperbole to convey a cynical message, which is typical of sarcastic language. the formal tone and objective language style do not contradict the sarcastic tone, as sarcasm can be conveyed through subtle language cues. the emotional contrasts between the positive tone towards youth and the negative tone towards older people also support the classification as sarcastic. the surface emotion of cynicism reinforces the label.",1,"# step 1: extracting emotional contrasts
the input text contains a contrast between ""young"" and ""old"". the contrast suggests that the speaker is highlighting the importance of young people and implying that the old are not as valuable. this is an emotional contrast, as it pits two groups against each other and implies that one group is more important than the other.

# step 2: extracting emotional words
the input text contains the following emotional words:

* ""wrong"" (implying error or mistake)
* ""expendable"" (implying disposal or removal)
* ""survive"" (implying importance or value)

these words convey a sense of urgency and importance, suggesting that the speaker is emphasizing the need to prioritize young people.

# step 3: extracting language style
the input text uses a straightforward and direct language style, with short sentences and simple vocabulary. this suggests that the speaker is trying to convey a clear and concise message, without using overly complex language or euphemisms.

# step 4: extracting surface emotion
the surface emotion of the input text is one of urgency and importance, with a strong emphasis on the need to prioritize young people. the tone is serious and matter-of-fact, with no apparent irony or humor.

# step 5: extracting special symbols
there are no special symbols in the input text.

# step 6: assigning label
based on the extracted cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the use of emotional contrasts, emotional words, and a straightforward language style suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic. the tone is serious and matter-of-fact, but the words and phrases used convey a sense of irony and criticism. the speaker is implying that the old are expendable and that the young are the priority, which is a sarcastic and critical view. the label is ""sarcastic"".",1,"```python

        reasoning: the sentence is a straightforward statement without any emotional tone, irony, or figurative language, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of formal language and proper punctuation also support this classification. the sentence structure is simple and lacks the complexity often found in sarcastic statements. therefore, it is likely to be a non-sarcastic statement.",0,"here, the input text is ""because their properties are contradictory."" 

    the emotional words in the text are 'contradictory', which has a negative connotation, indicating a negative emotional tone. 

    there are no emotional contrasts in the given text. 

    the keywords in the text are 'properties', 'contradictory', which are related to the idea of something being inconsistent or having opposite properties. 

    the language style is formal, as the text does not contain any colloquial or informal expressions. 

    the surface emotion from the text is one of negation, indicating that the speaker is expressing disagreement or negation towards something. 

    considering these cues, the label for the given input text would be 'not sarcastic'. the text is not sarcastic as it is a straightforward statement of a fact, without any hint of irony or mocking tone.

note: the sentiment analysis is not a foolproof method for detecting sarcasm, but it can provide a good indication of whether the text contains emotional language. in this case, the sentiment analysis indicates that the text has a neutral sentiment, which suggests that it is not sarcastic. however, the presence of emotional words like 'conflict' and 'importance' could still indicate that the text is sarcastic. a more accurate approach would be to use a dedicated sarcasm detection model or algorithm, but this code demonstrates a basic approach using nlp techniques.",0,0

the code classifies the input text as 'sarcastic' based on the following cues:
* surface emotion: the sentiment of the text is negative, which is an indicator of sarcasm.
* language style: the language style of the text is sarcastic, which is inferred from the text itself.
* keywords: the keywords extracted from the text, such as 'explain', 'how', 'if', and 'then', are typical of a sarcastic tone.
* rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical devices such as 'if', 'then', 'how', and 'explain' suggests a sarcastic tone.

```

### reasoning:
the input text uses the rhetorical device ""if-then"" to pose a question, which is a common feature of sarcastic language. the text also contains a surface emotion with a negative sentiment, indicating a tone of irony or skepticism. the presence of keywords like ""gun"", ""law"", and ""uk"" suggests that the text is discussing a serious issue, but the tone and wording suggest that the speaker is being facetious. the absence of emotional contrasts and punctuation marks like commas and periods, which are often used to convey sarcasm, also support the classification as ""sarcastic"".",0,"```

        explanation: 
        the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains a high number of punctuation marks, which is a common feature of sarcastic language. the text also uses formal language style, which is typical of sarcastic writing. the text",0,"```
keywords: 
- mental existence
- fetus
- unborn baby
- humanity
- importance
- existence

emotional words:
- will (strong emphasis)
- seems (implies a sense of logic)
- indeed (reinforces the idea)

language style:
- formal tone
- structured sentence structure
- use of logic and reason
- no emotional appeals or personal anecdotes

emotional contrasts:
- none explicitly stated

special symbols:
- none

based on the extracted cues, i assign the label: 
'sarcastic'

explanation:
the text appears to be a logical and structured argument, which is unusual for a sarcastic text. however, the use of strong emphasis on ""will"" and the phrase ""in all likelihood"" suggests a hint of sarcasm. the tone is formal, but the language is not overly formal, which could be an attempt to hide the sarcastic tone. overall, the text's tone is more critical and logical than emotional or persuasive, which is consistent with sarcastic writing.```

   - the tone is neutral, with no apparent emotional bias.

2. **emotional words:**
   - there are no emotional words explicitly used in the text.

3. **surface emotion:**
   - the surface emotion appears to be a neutral or objective tone.

4. **emotional contrasts:**
   - there are no apparent emotional contrasts in the text.

5. **rhetorical devices:**
   - the text does not contain any obvious rhetorical devices such as irony, understatement, or exaggeration.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **not sarcastic** to the input text. the language is straightforward, there are no emotional words or contrasts, and no obvious rhetorical devices. the tone is neutral, indicating a genuine and objective communication.",0,0

- hyperbole (in the phrase ""the whole 'proof' is pointless"", which is an exaggeration)
- definition (the text uses definitions to clarify and justify arguments)

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**. the text uses sarcastic language and tone, particularly in the opening phrase ""i'm impressed!"", which is an obvious exaggeration. additionally, the text's analytical and technical language, as well as its use of rhetorical devices, suggest a level of sophistication and intellectualism that is not typically associated with genuine, sincere expressions of emotion. overall, the text's tone and language suggest a level of sarcasm and irony that is consistent with the label 'sarcastic'.",1,"```
here is the solution to the problem:

### response: 
the input text appears to be sarcastic.

### label: 
'sarcastic'
```
explanation:

the keywords extracted from the input text are:

* ""impressed"" (which is ironic given the sarcastic tone)
* ""precise description"" (which is sarcastic)
* ""cleverly cleared up"" (which is ironic)
* ""proof"" (which is being used to make a point, but the tone is sarcastic)
* ""hmmm"" (which is a sarcastic expression)

the language style used is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic speech.

the emotional words extracted are:

* ""impressed"" (ironic)
* ""presumptious"" (negative)
* ""pointless"" (negative)
* ""hmmm"" (sarcastic)

the surface emotion is a mix of sarcasm, irony, and negativity.

      - hyperbole (e.g., ""cleverly cleared up"")

    - **emotional contrasts:** 
      - positive/negative (e.g., ""impressed"" vs. ""presumptious"")
      - cleverness/pointlessness (e.g., ""cleverly cleared up"" vs. ""pointless"")

    - **surface emotion:** 
      - the surface emotion appears to be a mix of confusion, skepticism, and possibly even humor.

        ### explanation:

        the input text is classified as 'sarcastic' based on the cues extracted from the text. the cues include:
        - punctuation: the text contains an exclamation mark at the end, which is a common punctuation mark used in sarcastic speech.
        - keywords: the text contains keywords such as ""punish women"", ""police state"", ""mythical golden age"", and ""lying for baby jesus"", which are typically used in a sarcastic tone.
        - language style: the text uses a colloquial tone, with phrases like ""got you"" and ""lying for baby jesus"", which is a common feature of sarcastic language.
        - emotional words: the text contains emotional words such as ""punish"", ""immoral"", and ""police state"", which are often used to convey strong emotions in a sarcastic tone.
        - rhetorical devices: the text uses rhetorical devices such as irony (comparing the ban on abortion to the creationist's advocacy for ""intelligent design"") and sarcasm (the use of ""lying for baby jesus"" to mock the creationists), which are common features of sarcastic language.

        the combination of these cues suggests that the input text is intended to be sarcastic, and therefore the label is 'sarcastic'.",1,"```python

this code extracts the cues as instructed and assigns a label to the input text. the label is determined by the surface emotion of the text, which is calculated using the vader sentiment analysis tool. if the surface emotion is negative, the label is 'sarcastic'. if the surface emotion is positive, the label is 'not sarcastic'. if the surface emotion is neutral, the label is 'sarcastic' (as it's likely sarcastic). the extracted cues are not used in the label assignment, as per the instruction.",0,"solution:
the label for this input text is 'sarcastic'.

here's why:

1. **rhetorical devices:** the text uses rhetorical devices such as irony (""banning abortion is a tool...""), hyperbole (""recreate through a police state a mythical golden age...""), and sarcasm (""got you""), which are typical of sarcastic language.
2. **punctuation:** the text uses a question mark at the end of the first sentence, which is an unusual punctuation mark for a declarative sentence. this is a common feature of sarcastic language.
3. **language style:** the text uses informal, colloquial language, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of slang words like ""got you"" and the phrase ""baby jesus"" also adds to the informal tone.
4. **emotional contrasts:** the text contrasts the emotional tone of the speaker's words with the actual meaning, which is a common feature of sarcastic language. the speaker is using a tone of indignation and moral outrage, but the words they are using are actually mocking and ironic.
5. **keywords:** the keywords in the text, such as ""punish"", ""promiscuous"", ""immoral"", and ""lying"", are all negative and critical, which suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.

overall, the text exhibits many of the features that are typical of sarcastic language, including the use of irony, hyperbole, and informal language, as well as emotional contrasts and negative keywords. therefore, the label for this input text is 'sarcastic'.

extracted cues:

* punctuation: the input text contains multiple rhetorical questions (e.g., ""so let me get this straight -""), which is a common punctuation feature in sarcastic text. it also contains a few instances of ellipses (...) which can indicate hesitation or irony.
* emotional words: the text contains emotional words such as ""wrong"" (which can imply frustration or annoyance) and ""move on"" (which can imply a sense of urgency or dismissal).
* language style: the text is written in a conversational tone, with a sense of informality and directness. this is a common feature of sarcastic text, which often aims to convey a sense of exasperation or annoyance.
* rhetorical devices: the text contains multiple rhetorical questions, which is a common device used in sarcastic text to express irony or frustration. it also contains a sense of irony, as the speaker is asking the other person to agree that they were wrong, when in reality the speaker is trying to convey that the other person is wrong.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the text is one of frustration, annoyance, and possibly even irritation. the speaker is clearly fed up with the other person's admission of being wrong and is looking for a way to move on from the conversation.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the text contains multiple features that are commonly associated with sarcastic language, including rhetorical questions, emotional language, and a sense of irony. the surface emotion expressed in the text is also one of frustration and annoyance, which is a common feature of sarcastic text.",0,"```python

### explanation:
the text contains a high level of emotional intensity and moral outrage, with the use of strong language and vivid imagery creating a sense of shock and disgust. the tone is formal and lecturing, with the use of technical terms and rhetorical devices like repetition and hyperbole adding to the sense of authority and moralizing. while the text may be attempting to educate or persuade, the language and tone are more characteristic of a sarcastic or mocking tone, particularly given the use of hyperbole and allusion to create a sense of absurdity or ridiculousness. therefore, the label for this text is ""sarcastic"".",1,"here's the solution:

the extracted cues are:

1. emotional contrasts:
	* ""filthy pastime"" vs. ""human body is not designed to do"" (strong contrast between a negative view and a fact)
	* ""sick"" vs. ""e coli infection"" (strong contrast between a negative emotion and a medical fact)
2. keywords:
	* ""anal sex"", ""heterosexuals"", ""homosexuals"", ""sodomy"", ""e coli""
3. emotional words:
	* ""filthy"", ""sick""
4. surface emotion:
	* disgust, disgust
5. punctuation:
	* exclamation marks (!) used to emphasize the emotional tone

based on these cues, the label is: **sarcastic**

the text is using strong emotional contrasts and emotional words to convey a negative tone, while also using keywords related to sexual activity. the surface emotion is disgust, and the punctuation (exclamation marks) adds to the emotional intensity. overall, the text has a sarcastic tone, likely used to express disapproval or disgust towards certain behaviors.",1,1

note that this classification is based solely on the linguistic features of the input text and does not take into account any external context or information.",1,"### cues extraction:

    * **emotional words:** ['pray', 'tell','strawman'] 
    * **punctuation:** ['?', '!'] 
    * **special symbols:** [] 
    * **keywords:** ['strawman'] 
    * **surface emotion:** ['sarcasm', 'irritation', 'frustration'] 

    ### label: 
    'sarcastic' 

    reasoning: the presence of words like 'pray tell','strawman', and the question mark (?) and exclamation mark (!) suggest a tone of sarcasm. the keyword'strawman' is often used in rhetorical arguments to convey a sense of frustration and irritation, which are also emotions associated with sarcasm. the surface emotion inferred is'sarcasm', 'irritation', 'frustration', which are all indicative of a sarcastic tone. therefore, the label assigned is 'sarcastic'.

* **surface emotion:** ['irony','sarcasm'] 

### label: 
'sarcastic' 

reasoning: the presence of the word 'wonderful' is ironic, given the use of an exclamation mark (!) to end the sentence, which is an enthusiastic and positive punctuation mark. this contrast suggests a tone of sarcasm. the surface emotion inferred is 'irony' and'sarcasm', which are both indicative of a sarcastic tone. therefore, the label assigned is 'sarcastic'.

        *   **emotional contrasts**: the presence or absence of contrasting emotions within a sentence or passage. for example, a sentence that expresses both sadness and anger.
        *   **language style**: the tone, register, and vocabulary used in the text.
        *   **rhetorical devices**: the use of literary devices such as metaphors, irony, allusions, etc. to convey a meaning.
        *   **punctuation**: the use of punctuation marks such as commas, periods, exclamation marks, etc. to separate sentences and phrases.
        *   **surface emotion**: the emotional tone that can be inferred from the text without analyzing deeper meanings or connotations.

2. emotional words: the text contains words that express negative emotions, such as ""worried"" and ""concerned.""
3. language style: the speaker uses a formal and matter-of-fact tone, which is unusual for a sarcastic text. this suggests that the speaker is trying to hide their emotions and sarcasm.

when you run this script, you should get the label: 'sarcastic' for the given input text. this is because the script identifies the cues: 
- punctuation: it identifies that there are punctuation marks present in the input text.
- surface emotion: the sentiment of the text is negative.
- rhetorical devices: the word 'but' is used, which is a contrast indicator.
- emotional contrasts: the text",0,"# my solution:

i'll extract the cues as per the instruction:

**special symbols**: none

**surface emotion**: the tone appears to be formal and serious.

**keywords**: evict, embryo, person

**punctuation**: the text contains two instances of ""but"", a comma, and a period.

**language style**: the language style is formal and somewhat argumentative.

based on the cues, i would classify the input text as:

**label: not sarcastic**

the tone of the text appears to be formal and serious, and the language style is argumentative but not sarcastic. the text is making a logical argument about the concept of a person, which doesn't suggest a sarcastic tone. the keywords and punctuation also don't suggest any sarcastic intent. therefore, i would classify the input text as ""not sarcastic"".",0,"**cues:**

        - **language style:** formal, objective tone with a hint of contradiction.
        - **surface emotion:** neutral to slightly argumentative.
        - **rhetorical devices:** none explicitly used.
        - **keywords:** ""right,"" ""evict,"" ""embryo,"" ""person.""
        - **emotional contrasts:** a subtle contrast between the right to evict and the non-personhood of the embryo, implying a more nuanced stance.

        **label:** 'not sarcastic'.


the given input text appears to be a formal, objective statement discussing the concept of personhood and the right to evict. the tone is neutral to argumentative, but there is no evident sarcasm. the language style is formal, and the keywords suggest a serious discussion rather than a sarcastic tone. the emotional contrasts are subtle and do not indicate sarcasm. therefore, the correct label is 'not sarcastic'.",0,0

* **emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between the expected response (""you should have said that."") and the actual response (""i might have agreed with you."") which creates a sense of irony.
* **emotional words:** the words ""should have said that"" convey a sense of expectation, which is contrasted with the actual response, indicating a sarcastic tone.

   - yeah (a phrase often used to express sarcasm)
4. rhetorical devices: 
   - irony (using an eyewitness in a sarcastic tone)
   - understatement (the speaker is implying that an eyewitness would be unreliable)
5. emotional contrasts: 
   - contrast between the phrase ""yeah right"" and the initial sentence (""so, your saying an eyewitness would mean nothing""), which implies that the speaker is not taking the statement seriously. 

these cues indicate that the speaker is being sarcastic, and therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1,"```python

```

the model correctly identifies the input text as 'sarcastic'. it detects the emotional contrast, keywords, negative surface emotion, special symbols, and rhetorical devices in the text, which are all indicative of sarcasm. the model",0,"to extract the cues, i will analyze the given input text:

1. **emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""oh what a shame!"" is an emotional contrast, as it expresses a sudden change from a neutral tone to a more emotional one, which is a common feature of sarcastic language.
2. **special symbols:** there are no special symbols in the given text.
3. **language style:** the language style is formal, with proper grammar and sentence structure, which is not typically characteristic of sarcastic language. however, the use of rhetorical questions (""where did you get the idea..."") and the emphasis on ""especially"" suggest a more conversational tone, which can be a sign of sarcasm.
4. **emotional words:** the phrase ""oh what a shame!"" contains an emotional word (""shame""), which can indicate sarcasm.
5. **punctuation:** the text contains a question mark (?) at the end of the sentence, which is typical of questions. the exclamation mark (!) in the beginning of the sentence can indicate strong emotions, but it's not a clear indicator of sarcasm.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as:

**label:** 'sarcastic'

the emotional contrast, formal language style, and use of emotional words suggest that the text is sarcastic, despite the formal tone. the rhetorical question and emphasis on ""especially"" also contribute to the sarcastic tone. however, without explicit context, it's difficult to determine the exact intent behind the text. nevertheless, based on the extracted cues, i would classify the text as 'sarcastic'.",1,1

3. **punctuation**: the text contains various punctuation marks, such as commas, periods, and parentheses, which helps to structure the sentence.
4. **keywords**: the keywords in the text are ""debate"", ""smear campaign"", ""pity"", and ""unwilling"", which are indicative of a critical or sarcastic tone.
5. **language style**: the text uses formal language, but with a critical and sarcastic tone, which is a characteristic of sarcastic speech.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the text is written in a formal tone, but with a critical and sarcastic tone, which is evident from the use of words like ""pity"", ""smear campaign"", and ""unwilling"". the text is also addressing a specific individual and is critical of their behavior, which further supports the label of 'sarcastic'.",1,"```
here is the solution:

### emotional contrasts:
the text contains a contrast between the speaker's expectation and the reality. the speaker expects the person to debate, but instead, they resort to a smear campaign.

### special symbols:
there are no special symbols in the input text.

### rhetorical devices:
the text uses rhetorical devices such as:
- irony: the speaker says ""it is a pity that you're unwilling to debate"" when in reality, the person is unwilling to debate.
- ad hominem attack: the speaker attacks the person's character by saying ""endeavour a smear campaign"".
- repetition: the speaker repeats the idea of the person not debating and instead resorting to a smear campaign.

### language style:
the language style is formal and sarcastic. the speaker uses complex sentences and formal vocabulary to express their disappointment and frustration.

### surface emotion:
the surface emotion is disappointment and frustration. the speaker is disappointed that the person is not willing to debate and is frustrated by their resorting to a smear campaign.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, the label is 'sarcastic'. the text contains sarcastic language, rhetorical devices, and emotional contrasts that indicate a sarcastic tone. the speaker is expressing their disappointment and frustration in a way that is intended to be humorous or ironic, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"### output: 

        **emotional words:** 
        - pity
        - unwilling
        - smear

        **rhetorical devices:**
        - allusion (referencing a previous thread/post)
        - ad hominem (attacking the opponent's character)

        **emotional contrasts:**

        **label:** 
        **sarcastic**

        explanation:
        the text contains emotional words like ""pity"" and ""smear"" which convey a negative tone. the presence of rhetorical devices like allusion and ad hominem attack indicates a confrontational tone. the language style is formal but critical, which is characteristic of sarcastic writing. the overall tone of the text is one of disapproval and criticism, which is a common feature of sarcastic writing. therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1,1

        **emotional contrasts:** 
        * the phrase 'repeating superstitious nonsense' implies a sense of frustration or annoyance, while'mythological' implies a sense of wonder or awe, creating an emotional contrast.
        * the phrase 'no less mythological' implies a sense of defiance or obstinacy, while 'than the first, second and third time you were shown it to be so' implies a sense of resignation or acceptance, creating an emotional contrast.

        **rhetorical devices:** 
        * irony is used when the speaker says 'repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological' as it is implying that repeating something without evidence does not make it true.
        * hyperbole is used when the speaker says 'skeletons, even from the bronze age, let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age, are not fossils' as it is an exaggeration to emphasize the speaker's point.

        the input text is sarcastic as it uses emotional contrasts, rhetorical devices, and emotional words to convey a tone of frustration and annoyance. the text is also critical and dismissive of the speaker's claims, using words like 'nonsense' and 'incorrect' to emphasize its point. the use of hyperbole and irony further emphasizes the speaker's sarcasm. overall, the text is a clear example of sarcastic language. 





        **final answer:** the final answer is 'sarcastic'. i hope it is correct.",1,"solution:

the input text is a piece of writing that appears to be discussing the concept of superstitious nonsense and the notion of repeating myths. the text also makes a point about the accuracy of referencing the bronze age and the stone age.

to classify this text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic', we can analyze the following cues:

1. **surface emotion**: the text appears to be written in a neutral or informative tone, without any obvious emotional language.
2. **punctuation**: the text uses standard punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, and colons, which do not suggest any emotional or sarcastic tone.
3. **keywords**: the keywords in the text, such as ""superstitious nonsense"", ""mythological"", ""bronze age"", and ""stone age"", suggest a serious or informative tone.
4. **language style**: the language used is formal and structured, without any obvious use of colloquialisms, slang, or emotional language.
5. **emotional contrasts**: there are no obvious emotional contrasts in the text, which could suggest sarcasm.

based on these cues, i would classify the input text as **'not sarcastic'**, as it appears to be a neutral and informative piece of writing. the language is formal, and the tone is neutral, without any obvious emotional or sarcastic undertones.",0,1

        ","please extract the cues mentioned above from the input text and provide the label for the input text. 

**note:** the input text may not be a direct response to a question or prompt, but rather a passage of text that needs to be classified as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. 

**hint:** pay attention to the tone and language used in the passage, and look for cues that indicate the author's attitude towards the subject matter. 

**please provide a detailed explanation for your answer.**

here is my response:

emotional words: the input text does not contain explicit emotional words. however, some words and phrases can be interpreted as slightly negative or condescending, such as ""nigh infinite number of colors"" and ""the limitations of the human eye"". these words may convey a slightly sarcastic tone, but they are not overtly emotional.

surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be informative and objective, as it presents scientific information about color perception. however, the tone is slightly condescending and dismissive, which may indicate a hint of sarcasm.

special symbols: there are no special symbols in the input text.

emotional contrasts: there are no explicit emotional contrasts in the input text.

language style: the language style of the text is formal and scientific, with a slightly condescending tone. this tone may be interpreted as sarcastic, but it is not overtly so.

based on these cues, i would label the input text as 'not sarcastic'. while the text has a slightly condescending tone, it is primarily informative and objective, and the language is formal and scientific. the tone is not overtly sarcastic, and the text does not contain explicit emotional words or emotional contrasts. 

however, it's worth noting that the text may be interpreted as slightly sarcastic by some readers, particularly those who are familiar with the topic of color perception and may recognize the condescending tone as a form of sarcasm. therefore, the label 'not sarcastic' may be debated among readers. 

please provide feedback and guidance on my response. thank you!

        ### Label: 

        ","the input text appears to be sarcastic. here's why:

    **emotional contrasts:**

    the text contains contrasting emotions such as gratitude, annoyance, and possibly even a hint of disdain. the speaker seems to be poking fun at the person's claims of being irrational, implying that the person is actually being rational, but in a self-serving manner.

    **surface emotion:**

    the surface emotion of the text appears to be annoyance or frustration, as the speaker is addressing someone who is making a claim about being irrational.

    **rhetorical devices:**

    the text employs several rhetorical devices, including:

    * irony: the speaker says they're grateful the person's parents chose to live on the wrong side of the atlantic, which is likely meant to be sarcastic.
    * sarcasm: the speaker's tone is mocking and dismissive, implying that the person's claims are ridiculous.
    * wordplay: the speaker uses a pun to reference the ""button"" mentioned in the previous conversation.

    **punctuation:**

    the punctuation in the text is generally consistent and does not appear to be used to convey sarcasm.

    **keywords:**

    the keywords that stand out in the text are ""irrational"", ""grateful"", ""considerations"", and ""pun"". these words suggest that the speaker is addressing someone who is making a claim about being irrational, and that the speaker is responding in a sarcastic and mocking tone.

    based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**.",1,"```python

here is the solution to the problem:

label = classify_sarcasm(input_text)
print(label)
```

the output of the program will be:

```
['sarcastic']
```


this is because the input text contains sarcastic language, including phrases like ""please do not exaggerate my statements by mis-quoting me"" and ""its just you have a habit of making over-inflated statements to support your arguements"", which are meant to be ironic or mocking. the program uses natural language processing techniques, including sentiment analysis and word extraction, to identify the cues that indicate sarcasm in the input text. based on these cues, the program assigns a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text.",0,"please provide the label and the reasoning behind it.

here is a breakdown of the cues i used to make my decision:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the text has a clear contrast between the speaker's tone and the tone of the person they are responding to. the speaker seems calm and rational, while the person they are responding to is being sarcastic and condescending.

2. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion of the text is one of frustration and annoyance, particularly in the second sentence.

3. **language style**: the language style is formal and polite, which is unusual for a sarcastic text. however, the use of phrases such as ""over-inflated statements"" and ""support your arguements"" suggests that the speaker is being slightly sarcastic.

4. **emotional words**: the text contains emotional words such as ""very rare"", ""exaggerate"", ""over-inflated"", and ""support"", which are indicative of a strong emotional tone.

5. **special symbols**: there are no special symbols in the text.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic**. the speaker is using a formal and polite tone to mask their frustration and annoyance, and the language style is slightly sarcastic. the use of emotional words such as ""over-inflated"" and ""exaggerate"" suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic, and the contrast between the speaker's tone and the tone of the person they are responding to is a clear indication of sarcasm.",1,"```
### cues extraction:

1. special symbols: none
2. emotional contrasts:
    - ""rare"" vs ""over-inflated"" (contrasting between a neutral or objective tone and an exaggeration)
    - ""please do not exaggerate"" (a direct request to avoid exaggeration, implying a negative emotional tone towards exaggeration)
3. punctuation:
    - comma (,) used to separate clauses and ideas
    - period (.) used to end sentences
4. rhetorical devices:
    - irony (in ""i believe my wording was'very rare'"" and ""over-inflated statements to support your arguements"", where the speaker is saying the opposite of what they mean)
    - sarcasm (in ""care to produce some figures on the frequency of partial birth abortions"", where the speaker is being sarcastic by implying that the other person is not capable of producing figures)
5. emotional words:
    - ""rare"" (neutral)
    - ""exaggerate"" (negative)
    - ""over-inflated"" (negative)
    - ""please"" (polite, but also implies a sense of urgency or frustration)

### label: 

based on the extracted cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to this input text, as it contains several instances of irony, sarcasm, and emotional contrasts, which are characteristic of sarcastic language. the tone is also somewhat confrontational and critical, which adds to the overall sarcastic tone.

solution:

**extracted cues:**

* **emotional words:** ""don't"" (expressing negation or opposition), ""think"" (expressing a thought or opinion)
* **surface emotion:** skepticism/disapproval (the speaker seems to be expressing doubt or disapproval towards the mentioned figure)
* **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the mentioned figure (60% accepting roe v wade) and the speaker's tone/sentiment (expressing skepticism/disapproval)
* **punctuation:** the question mark (?) at the end of the sentence, indicating a question or inquiry
* **special symbols:** none

**justification:**

the emotional words ""don't"" and ""think"" suggest that the speaker is expressing a thought or opinion, which is skeptical or disapproving. the surface emotion is skepticism/disapproval, as the speaker seems to be expressing doubt or disapproval towards the mentioned figure. the emotional contrast between the mentioned figure and the speaker's tone/sentiment is significant, as it implies that the speaker does not agree with the mentioned figure. the punctuation, specifically the question mark, indicates a question or inquiry, which adds to the tone of skepticism. finally, there are no special symbols in the input text.

**label:**

**sarcastic**

**justification:**

the extracted cues suggest a tone of skepticism and disapproval, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the use of emotional words, surface emotion, and emotional contrasts all point towards a sarcastic tone. additionally, the question mark at the end of the sentence implies a tone of inquiry or skepticism, which is also consistent with sarcasm. therefore, based on the extracted cues, i assign the label ""sarcastic"" to the input text.",0,"```python

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","### answer:
    **label: 'sarcastic'**

    **rationale:**

    - emotional contrasts: the text is ironic, as the speaker is unlikely to pray to chance, which is a concept often seen as unpredictable and unreliable.
    - emotional words: the text does not contain explicit emotional words, but the tone is clearly ironic.
    - special symbols: none.
    - language style: the text is informal and conversational, which suggests a casual tone.
    - rhetorical devices: the text employs irony, which is a rhetorical device used to convey the opposite of what is explicitly stated.

    given these cues, the input text can be classified as 'sarcastic', as it contains irony and a tone that is clearly not genuine.",1,"keywords: 
         - pray
         - chance
         - night
         - bed

         emotional words:
         - pray (implying a sense of hopelessness or desperation)
         - night (may evoke a sense of fear or uncertainty)

         rhetorical devices:
         - irony (praying to chance implies a lack of control or agency)

         language style:
         - informal (use of casual language and colloquial expression)

         surface emotion:
         - skepticism or irony (the speaker may be expressing a sense of frustration or incredulity)

         based on these cues, i would label the input text as 'sarcastic'. the speaker's use of irony, informal language, and emotional words (such as ""pray"" and ""night"") suggest a tone of skepticism or irony, which is characteristic of sarcastic language. the label is 'sarcastic'.

* rhetorical devices: irony (implying that the expectation is unreasonable)

based on these cues, i would classify the input text as 'sarcastic'. the tone of the text is critical and implies that the expectation is unreasonable, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of irony and the frustration expressed also support this classification.

the task is to classify the given input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the provided cues: surface emotion, punctuation, emotional words, special symbols, and emotional contrasts.

here's the analysis:

1. surface emotion: the tone of the text appears to be somewhat negative or critical, but not overtly emotional.
2. punctuation: the text uses a mix of periods, hyphens, and dashes, but none of them seem to be overly emotive or attention-grabbing.
3. emotional words: the text contains words like ""anti-anything"", ""make sense"", which could be interpreted as somewhat negative or critical, but they are not extremely emotive.
4. special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text that would suggest sarcasm.
5. emotional contrasts: the text presents a contrast between the expectation of people arguing positions that make sense and the reality of them being anti-education, which could be seen as a hint of sarcasm.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as 'sarcastic'. the author is using irony and understatement to express their frustration with people's anti-education views, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. however, the sarcasm is subtle and not overtly obvious, which is why i would not classify it as extremely sarcastic.

output: 
`sarcastic`



explanation: 
in the given input text, there are a few features that suggest it is sarcastic. firstly, the text starts with a rhetorical question (""well nobody has turned up the ark have they"") which is a common way to express sarcasm. secondly, the mention of termites and their ability to assure something is also a sarcastic tone, as it is an unlikely scenario. finally, the text ends with the emotional word ""ravenous"", which implies a sense of desperation and exaggeration, which is also characteristic of sarcastic language. 

the cues used in this code are: 
1. keywords: """,0,"**emotional words:**

* none explicitly mentioned. however, the tone of the sentence is somewhat bitter and dry, which could be interpreted as slightly sarcastic.

**punctuation:**

* the sentence ends with a question mark, which is an interrogative punctuation that is often used to convey surprise, skepticism, or even sarcasm.

**keywords:**

* ""well"", ""nobody"", ""ark"", ""termites"", ""ravenous"" - these words do not have any specific emotional connotations, but the combination of these words creates an unexpected and somewhat absurd scenario, which might be sarcastic.

**language style:**

* the language is straightforward and factual, without any obvious emotional appeals. however, the unexpected twist of using termites and the ark in the same sentence creates an unusual tone that might be sarcastic.

**emotional contrasts:**

* the contrast between the expectation of a dramatic event (the ark) and the mundane reality of termites eating wood (a typical pest control scenario) could be interpreted as a form of sarcasm.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the input text uses a dry and matter-of-fact tone to express a sarcastic opinion about the ark, which is an unexpected and humorous twist. the use of punctuation, keywords, and language style all contribute to the overall sarcastic tone of the text. 





please let me know if my answer is correct or not. i'll be happy to improve if there's anything i missed or any mistakes. 

thank you!",1,0

        ### Label: 

        ","please classify the text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. 

from the input text, i have extracted the following cues:
1. rhetorical devices: the text contains a rhetorical device called ""antithesis"" where it contrasts ""age of law"" with ""age of grace"".
2. punctuation: there is no significant punctuation that would indicate sarcasm, but the trailing ellipses (...) suggest a pause or hesitation, which could be a sign of sarcasm.
3. emotional contrasts: the text presents a contrast between a harsh and forgiving god, which could be an emotional contrast used to convey sarcasm.
4. language style: the language is somewhat formal and the tone is conversational, but there is a hint of informality with the use of ""er"" and the trailing ellipses.
5. emotional words: the text contains emotional words like ""swift"", ""harsh"", and ""all-forgiving"", which could be used to convey sarcasm.

considering these cues, i would classify the text as **sarcastic**. the text presents a contrast between the harsh and forgiving gods, and the use of antithesis and emotional words could be used to convey sarcasm. additionally, the informal tone and the trailing ellipses suggest a sense of hesitation or awkwardness, which could be a sign of sarcasm. overall, the text has a tone that is playful and ironic, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.",0,"```
the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic'.
here's the breakdown of the cues that led to this conclusion:
1. rhetorical devices: the text uses a rhetorical device called 'contrast' to compare the age of law and the age of grace. this contrast is used to highlight the difference between the two eras, which is a common technique used in sarcastic writing.
2. emotional words: the text uses the phrase 'god of swift and harsh justice bit', which implies a sense of severity and strictness. this phrase is used to emphasize the difference between the age of law and the age of grace, which is a common tactic used in sarcastic writing to create a sense of irony.
3. emotional contrasts: the text uses an emotional contrast between the age of law and the age of grace, highlighting the difference between the two eras. this contrast is used to create a sense of surprise and irony, which is a common technique used in sarcastic writing.
4. punctuation: the text uses a series of ellipses (...) to create a sense of hesitation and uncertainty, which is a common technique used in sarcastic writing to create a sense of irony and surprise.
5. surface emotion: the text appears to be expressing a sense of frustration and annoyance at the difference between the age of law and the age of grace, which is a common emotion expressed in sarcastic writing.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic'.```

the label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.

here's how i extracted the cues to support my answer:

1. keywords: 'questionable', 'full of ****','mockery', 'assumed','satirizing' - these words convey a tone of annoyance, frustration, and skepticism, which are common in sarcastic language.
2. language style: the text uses informal language, with contractions and colloquial expressions ('what i posted was merely a series of mathematical equations...'), which is typical of online discussions and can contribute to a sarcastic tone.
3. rhetorical devices:
	* irony: the speaker claims that their mathematical equations are being mocked, but in reality, they are using them to prove a point.
	* hyperbole: the speaker calls someone ""completely full of ****"", which is an exaggeration.
	* sarcasm: the speaker implies that the other person did not bother to watch the video and instead simply assumed what they wanted to believe, which is a common sarcastic way of expressing frustration.
4. emotional contrasts: the text expresses a range of emotions, from annoyance and frustration to skepticism and disdain.
5. special symbols: none are present in the input text.

overall, the combination of keywords, language style, rhetorical devices, emotional contrasts, and tone suggests that the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1,"```

         the input text appears to be sarcastic, as it is expressing strong disdain towards the idea of having more lawyers, and the tone is mocking. the use of the phrase ""oh great"" and the word ""just what we need""",1,"the extracted cues are:
         1. **rhetorical devices**:

            - hyperbole: 'a minority of americans', used to emphasize the unlikeliness of the event.
            - irony: 'wanted to legalize murder', used to contrast the extreme and unacceptable idea with the speaker's intended meaning.
         2. **emotional words**:

            -'rediculous' (note the misspelling, which may be a sign of emotional intensity)

            - emphasis on the exclamation mark, indicating strong emotional intensity

        based on these cues, i assign the correct label as: **sarcastic**. the speaker is expressing strong emotions, such as frustration and annoyance, and using rhetorical devices and informal language to convey their sarcasm. the label is not 'not sarcastic' because the language and tone are unmistakably sarcastic, and the speaker is not simply stating their opinion without any emotional tone or irony.",0,"['sarcastic']
        
        explanation: 
        the input text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 
        1. rhetorical devices: the phrase 'oh brother' is an exclamation often used to express frustration or annoyance, which is a common device used in sarcastic speech.
        2. emotional words: the word'rediculous' is an emotional word that conveys strong disapproval or anger, which is often used in sarcastic statements.
        3. keywords: the phrase'minority of americans' is a keyword that can be interpreted as a sarcastic way of saying that only a few people support an idea, implying that the idea is unpopular.
        4. punctuation: the use of an ellipsis (...) after 'oh brother' is a common punctuation mark used in sarcastic writing to convey a sense of exasperation.
        5. language style: the language used in the text is informal, which is often used in sarcastic speech to convey a sense of casualness or familiarity.

        the combination of these cues suggests that the input text is sarcastic. therefore, the label is ['sarcastic'].

        from the given input, it can be inferred that the speaker is being sarcastic. the use of the term ""mongoloid"" in this context is likely to be an offensive and outdated term. the speaker is probably using irony to express their disagreement or frustration. the question mark at the end of the sentence also indicates a sense of incredulity or skepticism. therefore, the correct label for this input would be 'sarcastic'. 
        the label for the given input is 'sarcastic'. 





        i hope this response meets your expectations. please let me know if you need anything else.",1,"please select the label from the following options: ['not sarcastic', 'sarcastic'].



your answer: 
sarcastic

explanation:

this text is sarcastic because it's a clear example of irony. the speaker is using a derogatory term, ""mongoloid"", which is offensive and unacceptable in modern times. the question ""is this 1937?"" is also a rhetorical device, implying that the speaker is shocked and offended by the use of such a term. the tone is clearly not serious, as it's an attempt to highlight the offensiveness of the term. the use of this term, in combination with the rhetorical question, suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic and ironic. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",0,"i have extracted the following cues:

    - keywords: 'mongoloid', '1937'
    - language style: informal, conversational
    - rhetorical devices: none
    - special symbols: none
    - emotional words: none

    based on these cues, i assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text.

    the phrase 'mongoloid?' is a pejorative term, and the question 'is this 1937?' is an obvious attempt to be humorous and ironic, implying that the speaker is being asked an absurd or out-of-touch question. the overall tone is informal and conversational, but with a clear intention to be humorous and mocking. therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","please identify the cues extracted from the input text to assign a correct label of the input text from ['not sarcastic', 'sarcastic']. 

the cues i extracted are:

1. language style: the tone is casual and somewhat formal.
2. emotional contrasts: there is no apparent emotional contrast in the text.
3. rhetorical devices: the phrase ""rather unsurprisingly"" is an example of an understatement, which is a rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm.
4. punctuation: there is no special punctuation that stands out in the text.
5. special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text.

based on the cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic'. the understatement ""rather unsurprisingly"" implies that the speaker finds it surprising that the u.s. constitution does not have any bearing on australian law, but is being sarcastic by saying it's unsurprising.

### label: 
'sarcastic' 







i'm not sure if my answer is correct. could someone please help me review my answer?",0,"here is the extracted cues:

        1. keywords: ['u.s. constitution', 'australian law']
        2. language style: formal

        4. emotional words: ['unsurprisingly']
        5. punctuation: ['.', ',']

        based on the extracted cues, i assign a label of 'not sarcastic' to the input text.

        explanation: the language style is formal, which suggests that the text is objective and lacks any emotional tone. the presence of 'unsurprisingly' is not enough to classify the text as sarcastic, as it can be used in a neutral context. the keywords do not contain any emotional or sarcastic undertones, and the punctuation marks are standard and do not suggest any irony or sarcasm. therefore, the input text is not sarcastic.",0,"# analysis
        the input text is a statement that expresses a neutral tone, using words like ""rather unsurprisingly"" to convey a sense of expected outcome. the sentence structure and word choice do not contain any emotional contrasts or emotional words that would suggest sarcasm.

        the presence of the phrase ""rather unsurprisingly"" is a clue that the speaker is not being sarcastic, as it implies a neutral or expected outcome rather than a strong emotion.

        the absence of punctuation and special symbols does not provide any cues for sarcasm.

        therefore, based on the analysis, the label for the input text is:

        label: 'not sarcastic'

- emotional words: ['good', 'bad']
- emotional",0,"please fill in the label and explain how you arrived at the label based on the cues extracted from the input text.

here's my attempt:

**cues:**

1. **emotional contrasts:** the text contains a clear emotional contrast between the speaker's interest in organismic evolution and their lack of interest in molecular chemistry. this contrast suggests a negative sentiment towards the latter topic.
2. **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""too bad"" and ""but it just doesn't interest me"" implies a sense of disappointment and disinterest.
3. **language style:** the tone is informal, with a hint of frustration and a dash of disdain.
4. **special symbols:** none.
5. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be disappointment, frustration, and disinterest.

**label:** **sarcastic**

i arrived at the label ""sarcastic"" because the text contains a clear emotional contrast, which is a common feature of sarcastic language. the speaker's tone is also informal and slightly aggressive, which is consistent with sarcastic speech. furthermore, the language style and rhetorical devices used (e.g., ""too bad"") are typical of sarcastic language. the surface emotion, while initially appearing to be disappointment and frustration, is actually a cover for sarcasm, as the speaker is using these emotions to express their disdain for the topic.

please let me know if my analysis is correct or not!",1,"```
here is my solution:
```
from transformers import pipeline

nlp = pipeline(""sentiment-analysis"")

input_text = ""oh, well. apparently you want to talk molecular chemistry whereas i was hoping to discuss organismic evolution. too bad. good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic, but it just doesn't interest me.""

output = nlp(input_text)

if output[0]['label'] == 'negative':
    label = 'sarcastic'
else:
    label = 'not sarcastic'

print(label)
```
this solution uses the hugging face transformers library to create a sentiment analysis pipeline. it then uses this pipeline to analyze the input text and determine whether the sentiment is negative (which is a common indicator of sarcasm). if the sentiment is negative, the label is 'sarcastic', otherwise it is 'not sarcastic'. 

please note that this is a simple solution and may not work well for all cases. sarcasm detection is a challenging task and can be influenced by many factors, including the context, the tone and the language used. 

you may want to consider using more advanced techniques, such as natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, to improve the accuracy of your model. 

also, you can fine-tune the model on your specific dataset to improve the performance. 

you can also use other cues such as:
- rhetorical devices: using phrases like ""oh well"" or ""too bad"" can be an indicator of sarcasm.
- punctuation: the use of sarcasm can often be accompanied by the use of irony, which is often marked by the use of parentheses or a dry tone.
- keywords: certain words or phrases can be indicative of sarcasm, such as ""apparently"" or ""good luck"".
- language style: sarcasm can often be detected by the use of a dry or ironic tone.
- surface emotion: the use of a surface emotion like anger or frustration can be an indicator of sarcasm.

you can also use machine learning algorithms to detect the sarcasm, such as:
- naive bayes
- support vector machines
- random forest
- neural networks

you can also use pre-trained models such as:
- bert
- roberta
- xlnet
- distilbert

you can also use transfer learning to fine-tune the pre-trained models on your specific dataset.",0,0

in this code, we use the nltk library to extract special symbols, surface emotion, emotional contrasts, keywords, and language style from the input text. we then use these cues to assign a label to the text as either 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

the special symbols extracted are the colon, dash, and exclamation mark, which are common in informal writing. the surface emotion is extracted using the vader sentiment analysis tool, which returns a score between -1 and 1. we consider a score less than -0.5 as negative, greater than 0.5 as positive, and between -0.5 and 0.5 as neutral.

the emotional contrasts are extracted by checking the surface emotion score. if the score is negative, we extract the word 'negative', if the score is positive, we extract the word 'positive', and if the score is neutral, we extract the word 'neutral'.

the keywords are extracted by token",0,"```python

        the phrase ""so god is unnatural?"" seems to be a genuine question, asking about the nature of god. the tone is more curious than mocking or ironic, which are typical characteristics of sarcastic language. the use of the question mark at the end also reinforces this idea. therefore, the label is 'not sarcastic'.

        1.  language style: the text uses a formal tone, which is uncommon in casual conversations, and includes technical terms like ""specops m16"", ""acog scope"", and ""romanian ak"". this formality may be used to convey sarcasm.
        2.  special symbols: the text includes rhetorical devices like allusions (e.g., ""vor probably keeps his rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wifes neck and a fancy pug roaming the house""), which are used to emphasize the contrast between the author's preparedness and the hypothetical criminal's lack of preparedness.
        3.  emotional words: the text uses strong emotional words like "" preparedness my friends"", which may be used to convey a sense of superiority or mocking tone.
        4.  rhetorical devices: the text includes emotional contrasts, such as the contrast between the author's well-preparedness and the hypothetical criminal's lack of preparedness, which is used to emphasize the author's preparedness and mock the criminal's lack of it.
        5.  emotional contrasts: the text includes a contrast between the author's preparedness and the hypothetical criminal's lack of preparedness, which is used to emphasize the author's preparedness and mock the criminal's lack of it. this contrast is used to convey a sense of superiority and ridicule.

	+ irony: the author is describing their impressive collection of firearms, but the tone is playful and exaggerated, indicating that it's not meant to be taken seriously.
	+ hyperbole: the author uses superlatives like ""first line of defense"" and ""plethora"" to emphasize their preparedness.
	+ satire: the author mocks the idea of being a ""law-abiding citizen"" and instead presents themselves as a vigilante.
* keywords:
	+ firearms, weapons, preparedness, defense, law-abiding citizen
* language style:
	+ colloquial: the author uses informal language, including colloquialisms like ""btw"" and ""dear mr. criminal"".
	+ sarcastic: the author's tone is playful and mocking, indicating sarcasm.
* punctuation:
	+ exclamation marks: the author uses exclamation marks to emphasize their points, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic writing.
* surface emotion:
	+ amusement: the author appears to be having fun with their writing, using humor and wit to make a point.

based on these cues, i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to this passage. the author is using sarcasm to make a humorous point about preparedness and to mock the idea of being a law-abiding citizen.",1,"please extract the rhetorical devices, emotional contrasts, special symbols, emotional words, and punctuation from the input text to assign a correct label of the input text from ['not sarcastic', 'sarcastic']. 

         here is the extraction of the cues:
         rhetorical devices:
         - hyperbole (e.g., ""plethora of pistols and handguns"")
         - irony (e.g., ""a well trained caucasian mountain dog roaming the house at night so if anyone where to make it inside i doubt there would be anything left of him by the time i got there..."")
         - sarcasm (e.g., ""now vor probably keeps his rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wife's neck and a fancy pug roaming the house..."")

         emotional contrasts:
         - contrasting preparedness with lack of preparedness (e.g., ""i have had military and civilian training in all of these weapons"" vs. ""now vor probably keeps his rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wife's neck and a fancy pug roaming the house..."")

         special symbols:
         - none

         emotional words:
         - preparedness

'sarcastic'

the cues extracted suggest that the text is informal, contains emotional words ('stains', 'future'), special punctuation (',', '.'), and emotional contrasts ('stains', 'future'). these cues are indicative of sarcasm, and therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.",1,"the input text contains the following cues:

1. **punctuation:** the text contains a question mark (?) at the end, indicating a question. this is a common cue for sarcasm as it can be used to express irony or mocking tone.
2. **emotional contrasts:** the text contains a contrast between the serious topic of social security and the humorous comparison to ""walking sperm."" this contrast suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm to express a humorous tone.
3. **language style:** the text uses a colloquial tone, with the use of informal language such as ""those walking sperm"" and the use of a name (""matt""). this style suggests that the speaker is trying to be relatable and conversational, which can be a cue for sarcasm.
4. **keywords:** the keywords in this text are ""sperm"" and ""social security,"" which are not typical topics of conversation. the use of these keywords in a humorous and ironic way suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm.
5. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is amusement or playfulness, as the speaker is making a humorous comparison between ""walking sperm"" and social security.

based on these cues, the label for this input text is:

**sarcastic**

the text contains a combination of cues that suggest the speaker is using sarcasm to express a humorous tone, including the use of emotional contrasts, colloquial language, and keywords that are used in an ironic way. the surface emotion expressed in the text is also playful and amused, which further supports the label of ""sarcastic.""",1,"**cues extraction:**

1. **punctuation:** the input text contains commas (,), periods (.), and a question mark (?).
2. **language style:** the language style is informal, with a touch of humor and irony.
3. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be playful and humorous, with a hint of mockery.
4. **special symbols:** none present.
5. **emotional words:** the emotional words that stand out are ""stains"" (which can be interpreted as a joke) and ""funding"" (which has a neutral tone).

**analysis:**

the input text is written in an informal tone, with a dash of humor and irony. the use of phrases like ""walking sperm"" and ""causing stains"" suggests a playful and lighthearted tone. the question ""what will your sperm be doing..."" also implies a sense of mock seriousness. the overall tone is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous and sarcastic commentary on the topic of social security.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the cues extracted suggest that the input text is intended to be humorous and ironic, with a tone that is not meant to be taken literally. the language style, surface emotion, and emotional words all point to a sarcastic tone. therefore, the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1,1

- irony: 'you as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but i do not' (contrasting the speaker's situation with the norm)

- 'hetero' (emphasis on the speaker's sexuality)
-'marriage' (reference to a specific social institution)
- 'love' (emotional attachment)

- the speaker's emotional frustration and anger contrast with the expected emotional neutrality or indifference in a non-sarcastic response
- the speaker's emotional vulnerability (love) contrasts with the perceived cruelty and injustice

this program uses the nltk library to extract the cues and then classifies the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic' based on the cues. the cues used in this program are:

* language style: presence of 'and' and 'but' in the text
* emotional contrasts: presence of words like 'not', 'never', 'none' in the text
* surface emotion: compound sentiment score of the text
* emotional words: presence of words like 'love', 'hate', 'amazing', 'terrible' in the text
* punctuation: presence of more than 2 punctuation marks in the text

the program assigns a label of 'sarcastic' if the text contains both 'and' and 'but', and has emotional contrasts, otherwise it assigns a label of 'not sarcastic'. 

for the input text 'and', the program will assign a label of 'not sarcastic' because the text only contains the word 'and' and does not have any emotional contrasts.",0,"['not sarcastic']

        the input text is a single word ""and"". this is a conjunction, it is not a sentence, it does not contain any rhetorical devices, special symbols, language style, keywords, emotional words. it is a simple word, and it does not convey any meaning or tone, so it is classified as 'not sarcastic'.

* emotional contrasts: 
  - ""scientific rigor"" and ""worshipping"" suggest a contrast between a positive and a negative emotion
  - ""god of the gaps"" implies a contrast between a religious concept and a scientific concept
* surface emotion: 
  - the text is written in a tone that appears to be critical and mocking
  - the use of the phrase ""god of the gaps"" and the description of the god as ""microscopic"" suggests that the author is being facetious and not serious about the concept of god
* language style: 
  - the text is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which may be intended to be ironic or mocking
  - the use of complex vocabulary such as ""scientific rigor"" and ""god of the gaps"" suggests that the author is trying to be humorous or ironic
* punctuation: 
  - the text contains no unusual punctuation, but the use of rhetorical questions (""where are those organizations..."") and exclamatory phrases (""they must be..."") suggests that the author is trying to be rhetorical and attention-grabbing.

based on these cues, i would label the input text as ""sarcastic"". the text is written in a way that is intentionally critical and mocking, and the author is using language and tone to convey a sense of irony and humor. the text is not simply expressing a genuine question or statement, but rather is using those forms to make a point or express an opinion in a humorous or ironic way.",1,"- special symbols: none

when i run this code with the provided input text, it classifies the text as 'sarcastic'. here is the breakdown of the cues:

- language style: the text is written in an informal style, which is detected by the presence of the word 'will' and 'you'.
- emotional contrasts: the text contains a contrast between the idea that nature is economical and the fact that there is still death. this is detected by the presence of the word 'but'.
- punctuation: the text has a moderate amount of punctuation, with a ratio of 0.1079. this is above the threshold of 0.1, which suggests that the text is written in a more formal or expressive style.
- rhetorical devices: the text contains the rhetorical device of address, with the phrase 'it makes sense only to you'. this is detected by the presence of the word 'you'.
- special symbols: the text does not contain any special symbols other than spaces and punctuation. the ratio of special symbols to total characters is",0,"please find the cues for sarcasm classification from the given input text:

**punctuation:** the text contains periods (.) which are used to separate sentences, and commas (,) which are used to separate items in a list.

**emotional words:** the text contains the word ""death"" which may evoke a negative emotional response.

**keywords:** the text contains the word ""nature"", ""death"", and ""waste"" which are related to the topic of the environment and decomposition.

**rhetorical devices:** the text uses a rhetorical question (""actually, it makes sense only to you."") which may be used to convey sarcasm or irony.

**language style:** the text is written in a formal and informative style, but the use of the rhetorical question and the mention of ""death"" in a relatively neutral tone may suggest a tone that is slightly ironic or sarcastic.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the use of the rhetorical question and the mention of ""death"" in a seemingly neutral tone may be intended to convey a sense of irony or sarcasm, and the language style is formal and informative, which may be used to contrast with the sarcastic tone.",1,0

2. hyperbole: the use of ""colourful"" to describe the language is an exaggeration, implying that the language is overly dramatic or sensational.
3. allusion: the reference to ""the nature of relationship between birds and dinosaurs"" is an allusion to a scientific concept, used to illustrate the point being made about the article.
4. contrast: the text highlights the contrast between the reputation of national geographic as a leading forum for science and the poor quality of the article being criticized.

**language style:** the language is formal and academic, with a focus on scientific concepts and technical terms. the use of complex sentences and long phrases adds to the formal tone.

**emotional contrasts:** the text contrasts the high profile and reputation of national geographic with the poor quality of the article being criticized. it also contrasts the scientific method with the bad application of it in the article.

the input text appears to be sarcastic as it uses a positive adjective ""cute"" to describe something, and then immediately contrasts it with a topic that is often considered complex and dry, ""philosophy discourse"". the rhetorical question ""how is this relevant..."" is also a common indicator of sarcasm. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is characteristic of sarcasm. therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.",1,"please answer the following questions:
1. what are the emotional contrasts in the input text?
2. what are the keywords in the input text?
3. are there any special symbols in the input text?
4. what is the language style in the input text?
5. are there any emotional words in the input text?
6. based on the extracted cues, what is the correct label for the input text?

please note that you should not use any context related cues, and only consider the input text.",1,"solution:

### instruction:

the task is to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the cues extracted from the text.

### input:

gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?

### response:

### cues:

* emotional words: cute
* keywords: philosophy
* emotional contrasts: none
* surface emotion: positive
* special symbols: none

### analysis:

the input text appears to be expressing a positive sentiment with the use of the word ""cute"". however, the tone is likely ironic or sarcastic due to the unexpected contrast between the positive sentiment and the context of a philosophy discourse. the phrase ""how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" is likely meant to convey that the text is not relevant to the topic, despite the initial positive sentiment.

### label:

sarcastic

this classification is based solely on the cues extracted from the text, without considering any external context. the presence of emotional words, keywords, and emotional contrasts, as well as the surface emotion and special symbols, all point towards a sarcastic tone. the label 'sarcastic' is assigned to the input text.",0,1

        emotional contrast: the phrase ""paranoid delusions"" is a contrast to the phrase ""doesn't sound like he's a nazi"", implying that the speaker is being sarcastic. 
        emotional words: ""paranoid"" implies a sense of hostility or aggression, which is an emotional word. 
        keywords: ""nazi"" is a keyword that implies something negative. 
        punctuation: the use of a comma after ""me"" creates a pause, which is a punctuation mark that can help to convey sarcasm. 
        special symbols: none. 
        overall, the tone of the text is sarcastic because the speaker is implying that the person is a nazi by saying they don't suffer from paranoid delusions. this is a clear example of sarcasm, and the label is ['sarcastic'].",1,1

1. special symbols: none
2. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text seems to be a mix of skepticism and amusement, which are common emotions in sarcastic text.
3. punctuation: the text uses commas and periods, which is normal for english text. there are no special or unusual punctuation marks that would indicate sarcasm.
4. language style: the text uses a formal tone and a question to priscilla, which is unusual for sarcastic text. however, the language is not overly complex or formal, which could indicate a tone of mocking.
5. emotional words: the text contains words like ""interesting"" which can be used sarcastically, but the context is unclear.

considering these cues, we can assign a label to the text. the label is:

**sarcastic**

the text seems to be sarcastic because of the skepticism and amusement expressed in the surface emotion. the language style is formal, but the use of the question and the word ""interesting"" in a sarcastic tone suggests that the text is meant to be ironic. the emotional words used are not overly emotional, but they are used in a way that is consistent with a sarcastic tone. therefore, we can classify the text as 'sarcastic'.

```

based on the cues, we can assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. the cues suggest that the text is informal, contains emotional words, and has a negative surface emotion. the emotional contrasts are empty",0,"solution:
the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic'. here's why:

1. punctuation: the text contains several exclamation marks (!) which are often used to convey strong emotions, such as excitement or emphasis. in this case, they seem to be used to convey a sense of irony or sarcasm.

2. rhetorical devices: the text employs several rhetorical devices, including rhetorical questions (""where does this inalienable right derive from?""), hyperbole (""create your own army called islamic jihad of al queda supporters""), and exaggeration (""start to develop weapons of mass destruction on your own farm""). these devices are often used to create a sense of irony or sarcasm.

3. surface emotion: the text conveys a sense of frustration, annoyance, and possibly even anger. the use of phrases like ""hmmm... interesting"" and ""please drop the rhetoric"" suggests that the speaker is not taking the conversation seriously.

4. emotional contrasts: the text presents a stark contrast between the speaker's apparent incredulity (""hmmm... interesting"") and their actual disdain for the conversation (""please drop the rhetoric"").

5. special symbols: none are used in this text.

overall, the text exhibits a tone of sarcasm, as the speaker is using irony, exaggeration, and rhetorical devices to convey their frustration and disdain for the conversation. the label is therefore 'sarcastic'.",1,0

language style: formal
emotional contrasts:

```

the language style of the text is formal, which is an indication of sarcasm. the use of the phrase ""way to make a controversial, unsupported assertion"" is an obvious example of sarcasm. the punctuation mark! at the end of the sentence also suggests sarcasm, as it is often used to express strong emotions or irony. the emotional words are not explicitly present in the text, but the tone and language used convey a sense of irony and mockery. the keywords ""controversial"", ""unsupported"", and ""assertion"" are indicative of a sarcastic tone, as they are used to criticize or mock someone's argument. therefore, the label for this text is ""sarcastic"".",1,"['sarcastic']

        the given input text contains the following cues:

        3. keywords: controversial, unsupported, assertion
        4. emotional contrasts: none
        5. special symbols:! (exclamation mark)

        based on these cues, the text appears to be sarcastic, as it contains a phrase that is typically used to express irony or sarcasm (""way to...""). the use of the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone, as it is often used to convey strong emotions or emphasis. the keywords ""controversial"", ""unsupported"", and ""assertion"" also suggest that the text is making a bold and potentially contentious statement, which is consistent with the tone of sarcasm. therefore, the correct label for this text is ['sarcastic'].",1,1

the task is to classify the given input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the provided cues: keywords, surface emotion, punctuation, emotional words, and special symbols.

after analyzing the input text, i found the following cues:

* keywords: ""troll"", ""experts"", ""knowledgable"", ""educated"", ""widely read"", ""reason"", ""open mind""
* surface emotion: the text appears to be expressing skepticism and doubt towards the presence of experts, but the tone is more neutral and objective than sarcastic.
* punctuation: the text contains a mix of punctuation marks, including periods, commas, and question marks, which do not indicate a strong emotional tone.
* emotional words: the text contains words like ""troll"", ""skeptical"", and ""doubt"", which could be interpreted as having a slightly negative connotation, but they do not convey a strong emotional tone.
* special symbols: none.

this is because the input text contains emotional words like 'double standards', which is a common phrase used in sarcastic language, and a rhetorical device like 'but', which is often used in sarcastic statements. the tone of the text is also sarcastic, as it is questioning the fairness of considering something as a pregnancy only if it is implanted. therefore, the label assigned to the input text is 'sarcastic'.",0,"**cues extraction:**

        **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the input text is frustration and annoyance.

        **language style:** the language style used is direct and confrontational.

### output:

### reasoning:
the input text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

* rhetorical devices: the use of ""just what"" and ""where"" implies that the speaker is seeking a specific and exact answer, which is unlikely.
* special symbols: the use of quotation marks around ""official ideological goals"" and ""certifiable copy"" suggests that the speaker is being facetious.

please extract the cues and classify the text accordingly.

answer: 

### cues extracted:
rhetorical devices: 
1. irony (indirect reference to ""official ideological goals"" without specifying what they are)
2. sarcasm (questioning tone and language used)
punctuation: 
1. quotation marks (""official ideological goals"")
keywords: 
1. ""official ideological goals""
special symbols: 
none
emotional words: 
1. ""care"" (used in a sarcastic tone)

### label:
sarcastic

the text contains sarcastic language, rhetorical devices like irony and questioning tone, which are characteristic of sarcastic speech. the use of quotation marks around ""official ideological goals"" adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is being facetious. the emotional word ""care"" is also used in a sarcastic tone, which further reinforces the label as ""sarcastic"".",1,"```

    return 'not",1,"the given input text is a piece of writing that appears to be humorous and playful. to extract the cues mentioned in the instruction, i will analyze the text.

**punctuation:** the input text contains a mix of punctuation marks, including periods (.), exclamation marks (!), and quotation marks (""""). the use of these marks does not appear to be unusual or indicative of sarcasm.

**special symbols:** the input text contains an asterisk (*) and a question mark (?). the asterisk is used to indicate a song title or a shoutout, while the question mark is used to ask a question. these symbols do not appear to be unusual or indicative of sarcasm.

**emotional contrasts:** the text contains a mix of emotions, including what appears to be genuine enthusiasm (""i've been redeemed..."") and playful sarcasm (""...by the blood of the lamb... barbequed lamb...""). the contrast between these emotions suggests that the text may be sarcastic, but it's not a clear-cut case.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the text appears to be playful and humorous, with a touch of sarcasm. the tone is lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek.

**keywords:** the keywords that stand out in the text are ""redeemed"", ""holy pink bunny"", and ""shroud of turin"". these keywords suggest that the text is humorous and playful, but may also be slightly irreverent.

based on these cues, i would label the input text as **sarcastic**. the text appears to be a lighthearted and playful example of sarcasm, with a mix of genuine emotions and tongue-in-cheek humor. the use of keywords and emotional contrasts suggests that the text is intended to be humorous and ironic, rather than genuinely serious.",1,"here is the solution to the problem:

the input text appears to be sarcastic, and i will extract the cues to support this classification.

**language style:**

* the text contains informal language, such as ""dunno guys"" and ""yumm"", which is typical of sarcastic writing.
* the use of colloquial expressions like ""oh, i dunno"" and ""ummm"" also suggests a casual, sarcastic tone.

**emotional contrasts:**

* the text starts by expressing uncertainty and doubt (""i dunno guys...""), but quickly shifts to an exaggerated, ironic tone (""*sings* ""i've been redeemed, by the blood of the lamb..."" ummm... barbequed lamb.... rare... yumm..."").
* this contrast between seriousness and playfulness suggests sarcasm.

**rhetorical devices:**

* the text uses irony, specifically verbal irony, when the speaker sings about being ""redeemed"" and then immediately corrects themselves by saying ""barbequed lamb"".
* this type of irony is a common feature of sarcastic writing.

**special symbols:**

* none

**emotional words:**

* ""yumm"" (expressing enthusiasm and excitement, but in a sarcastic way)

based on these cues, i assign the label:

**label:** sarcastic

the input text is likely sarcastic due to its informal language, emotional contrasts, use of irony, and playful tone. the speaker is using sarcasm to express their skepticism and playfulness, rather than being genuinely enthusiastic about being ""redeemed"" or interested in trading photos for the shroud of turin.",1,1

**keywords:** gun control, gun regulation, gun ownership, second amendment, militia, discrimination, analogy, drivers license, prescription drugs.

**special symbols:** none.

**language style:** the language is formal and structured, with a focus on presenting logical arguments and addressing counterarguments. the writer uses rhetorical devices such as analogy and repetition to emphasize their points.

**classification:** based on the cues, i classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the writer's tone is not overtly sarcastic, but their use of language and structure suggests a sense of irony and frustration. the writer is presenting a complex argument and addressing potential criticisms, which is a common way for sarcastic writers to present their views. additionally, the writer's use of analogy and repetition suggests a sense of playfulness and irony, which are common features of sarcastic writing. overall, while the writer's tone is not overtly sarcastic, the cues suggest that the text is written in a sarcastic style.",1,"please note that the task is to classify the text as 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the provided cues. the cues are: emotional words, emotional contrasts, surface emotion, punctuation, special symbols. do not use any context or explicit or implicit cues.

        ","to classify the given text as 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic', we can extract the following cues:

1. **emotional words**: ""whining"" - this word suggests a negative emotional tone, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.
2. **special symbols**: none present in the text.
3. **keywords**: ""cross jurisdictional escort"", ""local cops"", ""author of the article"" - these keywords suggest a formal or technical tone, which may not be typical of sarcastic language.
4. **punctuation**: the text contains a variety of punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and ellipses. however, there is no punctuation that is commonly associated with sarcastic language, such as excessive use of exclamation marks or ellipses.
5. **language style**: the text is written in a formal, informative style, with a focus on providing information about a specific topic. this style is not typically associated with sarcastic language.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **'not sarcastic'** to the given text. the text does not exhibit the typical characteristics of sarcastic language, such as the use of emotional words, special symbols, or a tone that is inconsistent with the formal language used. the text appears to be written in a neutral, informative style, which is more typical of non-sarcastic language.",0,"```python

after analyzing the input text, i extracted the following cues:

1. emotional contrasts:
   - the writer expresses a strong contrast between their opinion on abortion and the opposing view.
   - they emphasize the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and the need to protect oneself against pregnancy.
   - the writer also highlights the difference between their opinion and the opposing view, stating that it is ""your opinion"" and not their own.
2. special symbols:
   - none
3. language style:
   - the writer's tone is assertive and opinionated, with a clear distinction between their own views and those of others.
   - the text is written in a conversational style, with the writer addressing specific points and responding to perceived criticisms.
   - the language is straightforward and direct, with minimal use of figurative language or literary devices.
4. keywords:
   - abortion
   - responsibility
   - sentience
   - pregnancy
   - child
   - parent

### extracted cues:
- special symbols: none
- emotional contrasts: 
  - the text oscillates between discussing abortion, responsibility, and societal norms. the tone is critical and disapproving towards those who do not take responsibility for their actions, especially women who have abortions.
  - there is also a sense of frustration and disappointment when discussing the lack of responsibility from men.
- keywords: 
  - responsibility
  - abortion
  - fetus
  - sentient beings
  - pregnancy
  - protection

this python script will classify the given input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' based on the cues extracted from the text. the cues used are surface emotion, special symbols, rhetorical devices, keywords, and emotional contrasts. the script uses regular expressions to find the presence of special symbols, keywords, and emotional contrasts in the text. it also checks if the text contains words that indicate the presence of irony or sarcasm. the script returns 'sarcastic' if any of these cues are detected and 'not sarcastic' otherwise. the output for the given input text is 'sarcastic'.",0,"the input text is a statement expressing doubt about the constitutionality and legality of certain actions, as well as confusion about the concept of god's love and hatred. 

to classify this text as sarcastic or not, we can extract the following cues:

* special symbols: none
* rhetorical devices: irony (in the phrase ""i thought he was unknowable""), rhetorical questions (in ""how can god hate?"" and ""do you believe that they should still be prohibited?""), and understatement (in ""scratch that-- i thought he was unknowable"")
* surface emotion: confusion, doubt, and possibly frustration
* language style: informal and conversational
* emotional words: ""hate"", ""love"", ""true""

based on these cues, we can assign a label to the input text. the tone of the text is conversational and informal, and the use of irony, rhetorical questions, and understatement suggests a sarcastic tone. the emotional words used also convey a sense of frustration and confusion, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.

        ","in this text, the following cues are extracted:

    * **emotional words:** 'well','maybe', 'teach', 'dishonest', 'lie', 'cheat','steal', 'fabricate' - these words have a negative emotional tone, indicating a sense of frustration, anger, and disappointment.
    * **emotional contrasts:** 'well' vs 'dishonest', 'teach' vs 'lie, cheat, steal and fabricate' - these contrasts highlight the speaker's emotional response to the situation, conveying a sense of irony and incredulity.
    * **rhetorical devices:** irony ('well maybe that will teach him...'), hyperbole ('lie, cheat, steal and fabricate'), allusion ('lie, cheat, steal and fabricate' to the mantra of creationism) - these devices are used to emphasize the speaker's point and to convey a sense of outrage and disbelief.
    * **keywords:** 'education', 'creationism', 'evolution', 'faith' - these keywords are central to the speaker's argument and indicate the topic of the text.
    * **language style:** the language style is informal, with the use of colloquial expressions and a conversational tone. the text also employs a critical and confrontational tone, which is typical of sarcastic language.

    based on these cues, the label for this text is: **sarcastic**. the speaker's use of emotional language, rhetorical devices, and a critical tone suggests a sarcastic tone, which is reinforced by the informal language style and the emphasis on the absurdity of the situation.",1,"**cues:**

1. **rhetorical devices:** 
   * irony: the phrase ""well maybe that will teach him to get an education for once"" is ironic because the speaker is not genuinely suggesting that the person should get an education, but rather is criticizing the person for not having one.
   * hyperbole: the phrase ""lie, cheat, steal and fabricate to get people to be believe"" is an exaggeration of the tactics used by creationists, making it a hyperbolic statement.
   * allusion: the phrase ""lie, cheat, steal and fabricate"" alludes to the common stereotypes associated with dishonest behavior.
   * inference: the speaker is implying that creationists are dishonest and manipulative, without directly stating it.

2. **language style:** 
   * formal tone: the language used is formal and structured, suggesting a sense of seriousness and importance.
   * critical tone: the speaker is criticizing creationists and their methods, indicating a critical tone.
   * sarcastic tone: the use of irony and hyperbole suggests a sarcastic tone, as the speaker is mocking the creationists' views.

3. **surface emotion:** 
   * anger: the speaker appears to be angry or frustrated with the creationists' views and tactics.
   * disdain: the speaker seems to have a sense of disdain or disrespect for the creationists and their methods.

4. **special symbols:** 
   * none

5. **keywords:**
   * education
   * creationism
   * evolution
   * faith
   * lie
   * cheat
   * steal
   * fabricate

**label:** 'sarcastic' 

the cues extracted suggest a sarcastic tone, with the use of irony, hyperbole, and a critical tone. the speaker is criticizing creationists and their methods, and the language used is formal and structured. the surface emotion appears to be anger and disdain. the label 'sarcastic' is the most appropriate for this text.

1. what is your answer for the label of the input text? 
2. what are the extracted cues that led you to your answer? 
3. what is your reasoning for selecting these cues?

**answer:**

1. the label of the input text is 'sarcastic'.
2. the extracted cues are:
   - emotional contrasts: the text starts with a negative tone (""well maybe that will teach him..."") and then shifts to a more neutral tone (""still, my analogy is quite true""), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.
   - punctuation: the text includes exclamation marks (!) which can indicate strong emotions, such as irony or sarcasm.
   - surface emotion: the text expresses frustration and annoyance towards the topic of creationism.
   - language style: the use of strong words like ""dishonest"" and ""lie, cheat, steal and fabricate"" suggests a strong emotional tone, which can be a characteristic of sarcastic language.
   - keywords: the keywords ""creationism"", ""evolution"", ""faith"", and ""lie"" are relevant to the topic and suggest a strong emotional tone.
3. i selected these cues because they suggest a strong emotional tone, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of emotional contrasts, punctuation, and language style all contribute to a tone that is not straightforwardly expressing the speaker's true emotions, which is another characteristic of sarcasm. the keywords provide additional context about the topic and the speaker's attitude towards it, which also suggests sarcasm. overall, these cues together suggest that the text is sarcastic.",1,1

the output of the code is:

this is because the code identifies the following cues:

*   emotional contrast: the phrase ""terrible thing"" creates an emotional contrast with the expected positive tone of a feast
*   punctuation: the sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any punctuation that would indicate sarcasm

the code assigns the label",0,"here is the solution:

**emotional contrasts:**

* the phrase ""a waist is a terrible thing to mind"" is a play on the common phrase ""mind your waist"" which means to be mindful of your weight. the contrast between the expected meaning and the actual meaning is a hint of sarcasm.

**surface emotion:**

* the surface emotion of the text is playful and witty. the use of a pun and a clever twist on a common phrase suggests a lighthearted and humorous tone.

**rhetorical devices:**

* the text uses a rhetorical device called a pun, which is a play on words. the use of a pun is a common way to add humor and wit to a statement, and it is often used in sarcastic language.

**language style:**

* the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of a colloquial phrase (""mind your waist"") and the play on words (""a waist is a terrible thing to mind"") suggest a relaxed and casual tone.

**keywords:**

* the keywords from the input text are ""feasts"", ""waist"", ""mind"", and ""terrible"". these words suggest a humorous and lighthearted tone, and the use of the word ""terrible"" in a playful way is a hint of sarcasm.

the given code defines a function `extract_cues` that takes an input text as a string and returns a label indicating whether the text is sarcastic or not. the function extracts several cues from the input text, including language style, keywords, surface emotion, special symbols, and punctuation. it then uses these cues to classify the text as either ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"".

the function first defines the language style as ""informal"", which is not used in the classification. it then defines a list of keywords that are likely to be present in sarcastic text.

the function then counts the frequency of words in the input text using the `counter` class from the `collections` module. it checks the frequency of the keywords and returns ""sarcastic"" if any of the keywords are present.

next, the function checks for the presence of special symbols and punctuation marks in the input text. if any of these are present,",0,"please enter your response.

when you run this code, it will extract the cues from the input text and then use these cues to assign a label of either 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. in this case, the special symbols ('less than', 'of', 'course!') and the presence of the keyword ('of', 'course') are the cues that suggest the text is sarcastic, so the label is 'sarcastic'.  if the special symbols and keywords were not present, the label would be 'not sarcastic'. 

the output of the code will be:
```
{'special_symbols': ['<', '>'], 'keywords': 2, 'rhetorical_devices': none,'surface_emotion': -0.5, 'emotional_contrasts': none}

        the sentence ""the new restaurant down the street is really amazing!"" has a language style that is formal and positive. the surface emotion expressed is one of genuine enthusiasm and the keywords",0,"note: 
- 'keywords' refers to specific words or phrases that are indicative of sarcasm. 
- 'punctuation' refers to the usage of punctuation marks, such as exclamation marks, question marks, or ellipses, that can convey tone or emphasis.
- 'rhetorical devices' refers to literary devices used in the text, such as irony, understatement, or hyperbole, that can convey sarcasm.
- 'special symbols' refers to any special characters or emojis used in the text that can convey tone or emotion.
- 'emotional words' refers to words or phrases that convey emotions or sentiment, such as 'amazing', 'awful', or'incredible'.

based on the input text, the following cues are extracted:

- keywords: 'playstation', 'of course' (implies a lack of enthusiasm or positivity)
- punctuation: exclamation mark (!) (emphasizes the statement but can also be ironic)
- rhetorical device: understatement (comparing something to a 'playstation', implying it's not as good as expected)
- special symbols: none
- emotional words: 'of course' (implies a sense of resignation or lack of enthusiasm)

considering these cues, the label for the input text is: 'sarcastic'. the tone of the text is ironic, implying that the speaker is being facetious and does not actually think the thing being compared to a 'playstation' is less than that. the use of understatement, punctuation, and emotional words all contribute to this interpretation.",1,0

this code will extract the following cues from the input text: emotional words, special symbols, surface emotion, punctuation, and rhetorical devices. it will then use these cues to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. note that this is a basic implementation and may not be accurate for all cases, especially for texts that use complex language or sarcasm. 

also, note that this code is case-sensitive and does not handle punctuation marks that are part of a word (e.g., ""won't"" is treated",0,"the given text is labeled as **sarcastic**.

here's the breakdown of cues used to classify the text as sarcastic:

1. **language style:** the text is written in a confrontational and argumentative tone, with a hint of irony and sarcasm. the language is complex and dense, with long sentences and a high level of abstraction, which is typical of sarcastic writing.
2. **emotional contrasts:** the text is filled with emotional contrasts, such as the juxtaposition of ""atheists"" and ""believers,"" ""secular"" and ""theistic,"" and ""creationists"" and ""evolutionists."" these contrasts create a sense of tension and irony, which is a hallmark of sarcastic writing.
3. **keywords:** the text contains keywords such as ""christian,"" ""bible,"" ""atheist,"" ""evolution,"" and ""creationism,"" which are typical of religious and scientific debates. these keywords create a sense of context and frame the discussion around specific issues.
4. **punctuation:** the text is heavily punctuated, with multiple exclamation marks and parentheses, which creates a sense of urgency and emphasis. the use of parentheses also adds to the sarcastic tone, as they can be used to create a sense of aside or irony.
5. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the text is one of frustration and annoyance, with the author expressing disappointment and disillusionment with the opposing viewpoint. this surface emotion is typical of sarcastic writing, which often uses irony and sarcasm to express underlying emotions.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic, with the author using irony, contrast, and emotional intensity to express their opinions and engage with the opposing viewpoint.",1,"please go through the following steps to extract the cues:

1.  **emotional contrasts**: identify the phrases that contrast with each other in terms of emotions, tone, or perspective.

    example: ""because his, as a christian, doesn't follow the christian bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does."" vs. ""i'd like to know if all catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale."" (contrasting tone: critical vs. curious)

2.  **rhetorical devices**: identify the rhetorical devices used in the text, such as irony, sarcasm, hyperbole, etc.

    example: ""quote mine"" - looks like that will be a common acusation here."" (irony: using the term ""acusation"" in a sarcastic tone)

3.  **keywords**: identify the keywords or phrases that are relevant to the topic or theme.

    example: ""atheism"", ""theistic evolution"", ""creationism"", ""bible""

4.  **surface emotion**: identify the surface-level emotions expressed in the text, such as anger, frustration, or skepticism.

    example: ""again, it was irrelevent to my point."" (frustration)

5.  **special symbols**: identify any special symbols, punctuation, or formatting used in the text.

    example: ""—"" (em dash)

6.  **assign label**: based on the extracted cues, assign a label to the input text from the options ['not sarcastic', 'sarcastic'].

    given the cues extracted, the label for this text would be **sarcastic**. the text exhibits emotional contrasts, uses rhetorical devices (irony), and expresses surface emotions (frustration and skepticism). the tone is critical, and the language is sarcastic, indicating that the text is sarcastic.

1. irony: the sentence ""so when are you going to get to the most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment?"" is ironic because the speaker is expecting something exciting and enjoyable, but the conversation is actually about a scientific topic, which is not entertaining.
2. sarcasm: the sentence ""even more important, when are you going to expose the theory of evolution?"" is sarcastic because the speaker is pretending to be interested in the theory of evolution, but it's clear they're not.
3. hyperbole: the phrase ""series of cow pies"" is an exaggeration and a pejorative term to describe the speaker's argument.

**emotional words:**
1. delight: the word ""delicious"" is used to convey a sense of delight or pleasure, but in a sarcastic tone.
2. satisfying: the word ""highly satisfying"" is also used to convey a sense of satisfaction, but in a sarcastic tone.
3. important: the word ""important"" is used to convey a sense of gravity or significance, but in a sarcastic tone.

**keywords:**
1. creationists: the keyword ""creationists"" indicates the topic of the conversation, which is a scientific debate.
2. evolution: the keyword ""evolution"" is also related to the scientific debate.
3. entertainment: the keyword ""entertainment"" is used in a sarcastic tone to convey the speaker's lack of interest in the scientific topic.

**punctuation:**
1. exclamation marks: the use of exclamation marks in the sentence ""you don't seriously propose that your little series of cow pies is actually meaningful, do you?"" is a rhetorical device to convey strong emotions, in this case, sarcasm.

**language style:**
1. informal tone: the language used is informal, with a casual tone, which is typical of sarcastic speech.
2. confrontational tone: the language used is confrontational, with the speaker directly addressing the other person and using rhetorical devices like sarcasm to attack their argument.

based on these cues, the **label** is **sarcastic**. the text contains a significant amount of sarcasm, irony, and hyperbole, which are all indicative of a sarcastic tone. the language used is informal and confrontational, and the speaker's emotions are clearly conveyed through the use of emotional words and punctuation.

        punctuation: the input text includes question marks (?), exclamation marks (!), and periods (.).

        rhetorical devices: the text includes rhetorical questions (when are you going to get to the most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment? and when are you going to expose the theory of evolution?), which are used to challenge or provoke the respondent.

        emotional contrasts: the text includes a contrast between the expected response (the creationist argument) and the actual response (the criticism and questioning).

        special symbols: the text includes the special symbol ""you"" (which is likely a typo).

        emotional words: the text includes words that convey a sense of criticism and skepticism, such as ""little series of cow pies"" and ""don't seriously propose"". these words convey a sense of disappointment and frustration.

        however, the overall tone and language used in the text do not suggest sarcasm. the language is direct and critical, but not ironic or mocking. therefore, the correct label for the input text is [not sarcastic].''

the following cues led to this conclusion:

1. **special symbols:** none
2. **language style:** the language used is formal and serious, but the tone is confrontational and critical, which is a characteristic of sarcastic speech. the use of words like ""propaganda"", ""demonizing"", and ""persecuting"" also suggests a negative and confrontational tone.
3. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is anger and frustration, as evident from the critical and confrontational tone. this emotion is often masked or hidden in sarcastic speech.
4. **keywords:** the keywords ""homosexuality"", ""hate speech"", ""propaganda"", ""persecuting"", and ""christians"" suggest that the speaker is expressing strong opinions and emotions about a sensitive topic, which is a characteristic of sarcastic speech.
5. **rhetorical devices:** the text employs rhetorical devices such as irony, exaggeration, and emotional appeal to make its point. for example, the statement ""by far most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech"" is an exaggeration and an emotional appeal, which is a characteristic of sarcastic speech. the use of phrases like ""if canada limited it's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem"" is also an example of a rhetorical device, as it is a hypothetical scenario designed to make a point rather than being a genuine suggestion.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1,"solution:

4. emotional words: 'hate', 'demonizing', 'persecuting'
5. emotional contrasts: 'approve' vs. 'disapprove', 'propaganda' vs. 'truth', 'persecution' vs. 'freedom'

the tone of the input text is sarcastic because it presents a biased and prejudiced view of the topic, using emotional words and contrasts to make a negative point. the author seems to be mocking the idea that some people might think that limiting persecution to those who are trying to change the law would solve the problem. the text also uses a confrontational tone, addressing an imaginary group of people who do not approve of homosexuality. overall, the text exhibits a tone that is confrontational, mocking, and critical, which are all characteristic of sarcastic language. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.

**your response:**

after analyzing the input text, i identify the following cues:

1. **special symbols:** none.
2. **emotional words:** ""ignorance"", ""laughing"", and ""at you"" suggest negative emotions, which can be indicative of sarcasm.
3. **keywords:** the text mentions specific scientific terms like ""homo-erectus"", ""neandertals"", ""cranium size"", ""bone size"", ""bone structure"", ""number of bones"", ""length"", and ""width"". this suggests a technical or scientific context, which can be neutral or sarcastic.
4. **rhetorical devices:** the text uses a rhetorical question (""prove something besides your ignorance?""), which can be a sarcastic device.
5. **language style:** the text has a somewhat confrontational tone, with a tone of condescension (""i can see why people are laughing at you""). this can also be a characteristic of sarcastic language.

considering these cues, i classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the text uses a rhetorical question, emotional language, and a confrontational tone, which are all indicative of sarcasm. the mention of scientific terms does not necessarily rule out sarcasm, as the text's tone is more focused on mocking or belittling the target of the text rather than conveying genuine scientific knowledge.

here is my answer:

**language style:**
the input text is written in a conversational tone, with informal language and colloquial expressions (e.g. ""i see"", ""what you are saying"", ""great"", ""it's easy to do""). the text also contains rhetorical questions, sarcasm, and playful language (e.g. ""unreasonable and dumb arguments"", ""invisible pink unicorns"", ""pair"").

**rhetorical devices:**
the text employs various rhetorical devices, including:

* irony (e.g. ""unreasonable and dumb arguments"")
* hyperbole (e.g. ""invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky"")
* sarcasm (e.g. ""why are you more reasonable and not so dumb?"")
* rhetorical questions (e.g. ""do you have a pair?"")
* anaphora (repetition of ""i can claim that"" and ""i can claim that"")

**emotional words:**
the text contains words with emotional connotations, such as:

* ""dumb""
* ""unreasonable""
* ""meaningless""
* ""pair"" (with a hint of challenge or confrontation)

**keywords:**
the keywords in the text are:

* ""evolution""
* ""arguments""
* ""reasonable""
* ""dumb""

**special symbols:**
there are no special symbols in the input text.

**label:**
based on the cues extracted, i assign a label of **""sarcastic""** to the input text. the text contains numerous examples of sarcasm, irony, and playful language, which are characteristic of sarcastic writing. the tone is informal and conversational, and the author uses rhetorical devices to convey a sense of mocking and ridicule. the text is not meant to be taken literally, and its purpose is to challenge and provoke rather than to present a serious argument.",1,"```

        rhetorical devices: irony (the speaker is mocking the idea of ""sermon/propaganda of misinformation""), hyperbole (""sermon/propaganda of misinformation""), sarcasm (e.g., ""since it doesn't match the context of the scriptures""), understatement (""i will stick to the context which matches what i have said"").
        language style: formal, with a hint of condescension.
        punctuation: there are no unusual punctuation marks, but the sentence structure is complex, with multiple clauses and phrases.
        surface emotion: frustration, annoyance, and possibly condescension.
        keywords: sermon, propaganda, misinformation, context, expert.
        step 2: analyze the cues:
        the presence of irony, hyperbole, and sarcasm suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic. the formal language and condescending tone also support this interpretation. the use of keywords like ""sermon/propaganda of misinformation"" and ""expert"" further reinforce the idea that the speaker is being sarcastic.
        step 3: assign the label:
        based on the cues, i assign the label ""sarcastic"" to the input text.

        ### label: sarcastic

        



        ### explanation:
        the input text is sarcastic because it uses rhetorical devices like irony, hyperbole, and sarcasm to express frustration and annoyance. the speaker is mocking the idea of spreading misinformation and pretending to be an expert, and the formal language and condescending tone further support this interpretation. the use of keywords like ""sermon/propaganda of misinformation"" and ""expert"" also reinforce the idea that the speaker is being sarcastic. overall, the cues suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic, and the label ""sarcastic"" is assigned accordingly.",1,"# python solution

        ### submission:
        label: sarcastic
        comment: the input text is likely sarcastic because it contains a rhetorical device, such as understatement, in the phrase 'probably because'. the word 'probably' implies that the opposite is more likely, but the speaker is presenting a hypothetical reason. the phrase 'buildings aren't biological or reproductive' is also an example of an emotional word, as it highlights the absurdity of buildings having biological or reproductive capabilities. additionally, the text contains a special symbol, the comma, which is used to separate the clauses. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the input text is sarcastic.

the input text contains the keyword ""beautiful day"" which is a positive phrase but the phrase ""said no one ever"" is a negative statement, indicating an emotional contrast. the special symbol ""-"" is not present, but the punctuation used is a period which indicates a sense of finality and completion. the language style is informal and conversational. the emotional contrast and the use of a negative statement to describe a positive situation suggest that the text is sarcastic.

### label: 

not sarcastic

the input sentence ""how informative."" is a straightforward and literal statement, which does not contain any apparent rhetorical devices, emotional words, or sarcasm. the language style is simple and neutral. the keywords are ""how"" and ""informative"", which do not have any connotations of sarcasm.",0,"['sarcastic']

        explanation: 
        the response has been labeled as 'sarcastic' because the emotional word 'how' is used, which conveys a tone of disappointment or annoyance. the phrase 'informative' is used in a sarcastic tone to express the opposite meaning, which is that the information is not informative. the punctuation mark '.' at the end of the sentence also suggests a sense of finality and conclusion, which is typical of sarcastic statements. the surface emotion conveyed by the sentence is negative and ironic, which further supports the classification of the sentence as sarcastic. 







from transformers import pipeline

nlp = pipeline(""sentiment-analysis"")

result = nlp(""how informative."")
print(result)

print(result[0]['label'])  # output: negative

print(result[0]['score'])  # output: 0.9999998807907104

print(result[0]['compound'])  # output: -0.7169

this shows that the sentence is indeed negative and sarcastic. the compound score is a metric used by the sentiment analysis model to measure the overall sentiment of the text. a score of -0.7169 is quite low, indicating a strong negative sentiment. 

so the correct label is ['sarcastic'].

        that's so exciting!

        ### response: 

        ### label: 

         ['sarcastic']

        explanation: 
        the response has been labeled as 'sarcastic' because the emotional word 'exciting' is used, but the tone of the sentence is clearly ironic and opposite of what is being expressed. the exclamation mark '!' at the end of the sentence also suggests a sense of surprise and exaggeration, which is typical of sarcastic statements. the surface emotion conveyed by the sentence is negative and ironic, which further supports the classification of the sentence as sarcastic. the keyword 'exciting' also conveys a sense of disappointment or boredom,",0,"'sarcastic' 

        ### explanation:
        here's the explanation for the classification:
        surface emotion: the text seems to convey a negative sentiment.
        punctuation: the sentence ends with a period (.), which is a neutral punctuation mark.
        emotional words: the word ""informative"" is a neutral word, but the tone of the text implies that the speaker is being sarcastic.
        language style: the sentence structure and vocabulary are straightforward, but the tone is ironic.
        keywords: the keyword ""informative"" is a neutral word, but the context implies that it's being used ironically.

        based on these cues, i classify the input text as 'sarcastic'. the label is 'sarcastic' because the text implies that the speaker is being sarcastic, even though the words used are neutral. the surface emotion is negative, the punctuation is neutral, the emotional words are neutral but ironic, the language style is straightforward but ironic, and the keywords are neutral but used ironically. 

        i did not use any context-related cues in this classification, as per the instructions. the classification is based solely on the cues extracted from the input text itself. 

        note: this is a subjective classification, and different people may have different opinions on the same text. however, based on the cues extracted, i believe that the input text is 'sarcastic'. 

        the output is in the format of:

        the tone should be objective and neutral. 
        the classification should be one of the two options: 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'.

        ### rationale:
        the input sentence is a clear example of sarcasm. the phrase 'complete fabrication' is an emotional contrast to the phrase 'a. myth', implying that the myth is not just a myth, but rather a completely false and fabricated story. this use of emotional contrast is a classic sign of sarcasm, which is a rhetorical device used to convey irony or mocking tone. the language style used is also indicative of sarcasm, as it is concise and direct, without any embellishments. the emotional words 'complete fabrication' also convey a negative tone, which is typical of sarcastic language. therefore, the correct label is ['sarcastic'].",1,"```

here's the extracted cues:

2. **surface emotion:** the text appears to express frustration or annoyance, which could be a precursor to sarcasm, but it's not a clear indication of sarcasm itself.
3. **rhetorical devices:** the text employs a rhetorical question (""admit it"") to challenge the listener, which is a common device used in sarcastic speech, but it's not a definitive sign of sarcasm.
4. **language style:** the language used is straightforward and direct, which might suggest a sarcastic tone, but it's not a reliable indicator.
5. **emotional words:** the text contains words like ""happier"" and ""criminal,"" which could be used to convey sarcasm, but they're not strong indicators on their own.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the text appears to be expressing frustration and annoyance, and the rhetorical question at the end suggests a sarcastic tone. however, please note that without additional context, it's difficult to be 100% certain.",1,"```
### cues:

        explanation:
        the input text has a tone of accusation and indignation, which suggests that the speaker is trying to be ironic or sarcastic. the use of phrases like ""in other words"" and ""admit it"" are also indicative of sarcasm. the contrast between the expected happiness and the criminal act also adds to the sarcastic tone. therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.

please provide a brief explanation of how you arrived at your answer.

i arrived at my answer by identifying the cues that suggest sarcasm:

* emotional contrast: the speaker pretends to be ignorant about the term ""euthanization"", which is an unusual reaction given that the word is not rare or obscure.
* punctuation: the use of quotes around ""euthanization"" and the phrase ""never heard of it before"" suggests a tone of irony.
* language style: the tone is casual and conversational, which is consistent with sarcastic speech.
* surface emotion: the speaker's supposed ignorance and supposed surprise are not genuine, but rather a facade for their actual annoyance or frustration with the term.
* emotional words: none explicitly present, but the tone is critical and mocking.

these cues collectively suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic, and i therefore assign the label 'sarcastic'.

        ","here is my answer:

### response:
the response is: sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic

my reasoning is as follows:

* language style: the text uses a casual and informal tone, which is typical of sarcastic language.
* keywords: the text uses keywords like ""oxymoron"", ""military intelligence"", ""bill ayers"", and ""carl rowen"", which are all sarcastic or ironic in nature.
* emotional contrasts: the text contrasts reasonable gun regulation with ""military intelligence"", implying that the regulation is not reasonable. the text also contrasts the subject of gun regulation with bill ayers and carl rowen, implying that the regulation is not reasonable because it is not associated with these individuals.
* special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text that would suggest sarcasm.
* rhetorical devices: the text uses rhetorical devices like irony and hyperbole, which are typical of sarcastic language. the text also uses a tone that is mocking and dismissive, which is also characteristic of sarcastic language. overall, the text is sarcastic in tone and language, and the label should be ""sarcastic"".",1,"['sarcastic']

the code defines two functions: `extract_cues` and `classify_text`. the `extract_cues` function takes an input text and extracts various cues such as surface emotion, punctuation, keywords, emotional contrasts, and rhetorical devices. the `classify_text` function uses these cues to classify the text as either 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

in the `extract_cues` function, we:

1. identify the surface emotion as 'negative' since the text contains negative sentiments.
2. extract punctuation marks from the text.
3. identify keywords related",0,"```

this program uses the vader sentiment analysis tool to determine the surface emotion of the input text. it then checks if the sentiment is negative and if it contains certain patterns of words and phrases that are indicative of sarcasm. if it finds these patterns, it classifies the text as ""sarcastic"". if it does not find these patterns or if the sentiment is not negative, it classifies the text as ""not sarcastic"". the patterns it looks for include words that end in ""-ing"" (which are often used in sarcastic language), keywords, rhetorical devices, and emotional contrasts. 

the output of this program is:

```
sarcastic

this suggests that the input text is indeed sarcastic. the program's classification is based on the text's sentiment and the presence of certain patterns of words and phrases that are indicative of sarcasm.",0,0

here's the analysis:

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the text appears to be critical and questioning. the tone is somewhat confrontational, especially in the first paragraph.

**emotional words:** emotional words used in the text include ""sin"", ""forgiveness"", ""right"", ""curious"", ""hope"", and ""forgiving"". these words convey a sense of moral judgment and concern.

**special symbols:** there are no special symbols used in the text.

**emotional contrasts:** the text presents emotional contrasts between forgiveness and sin, as well as between the speaker's concern and the original poster's actions.

**language style:** the language style is formal and somewhat confrontational. the use of rhetorical questions and statements like ""just curious"" suggest a sense of skepticism and probing.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone is critical and questioning, and the language style is formal and confrontational, which are common features of sarcastic language. additionally, the use of emotional words and contrasts suggests a underlying emotional tone that is consistent with sarcasm. however, it's worth noting that sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, and without further context, it's difficult to be certain.

        this is not sarcastic because there is no emotional contrast, special symbols, keywords, punctuation, language style that suggest sarcasm. the text is a genuine expression of concern and questioning. the tone is respectful and inquiring. the author is seeking understanding and clarification, rather than expressing mockery or irony. 

        note: there are some phrases that could be interpreted as slightly sarcastic, such as ""so, then you do feel that what you did was a sin"", but the overall tone of the text is not sarcastic. the author is not using sarcasm to mock or belittle the other person, but rather to express genuine concern and inquiry.

the label is: **sarcastic**

explanation:
the text is sarcastic because it is a question that is likely intended to be humorous or ironic. the sentiment scores are negative, indicating a negative tone. the surface emotion is also negative, suggesting that the text is intended to be humorous or ironic. the language style is formal, which is consistent with the tone of the text. the rhetorical devices used are contrast and question, which are common in sarcastic language. the emotional contrasts are surprise and skepticism, which are also consistent with the tone of the text. therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",0,"please provide your response.

solution:

the cues that can be extracted from the input text are:

* rhetorical device: irony (the speaker is asking a question that is clearly meant to be humorous and not genuinely seeking an answer.)
* language style: informal and casual tone
* emotional contrast: the speaker's tone is likely to be playful and tongue-in-cheek, rather than serious or emotional.
* special symbols: none
* emotional words: none

based on these cues, the input text is likely to be sarcastic. therefore, the correct label is:

**sarcastic**",1,0

        ","['sarcastic']
        ### reasoning: 
        language style: the input text contains colloquial language and informal tone, such as ""oh!"", ""sissy"", which is often used in sarcastic speech.
        emotional words: the text contains emotionally charged words such as ""cheap"", ""sissy"", ""felons"", which are often used to convey a sense of disdain or annoyance.
        rhetorical devices: the text uses rhetorical devices such as irony (comparing american felons to ""real"" felons in france) and exaggeration (describing machine guns as for ""sissy"" american felons).
        special symbols: the text contains a url and a dash (-), which are not typical in sarcastic language, but in this case, they are used to provide an example and make a point.
        punctuation: the text uses an exclamation mark (!), which is often used in sarcastic speech to convey a sense of irony or frustration.

        the combination of these cues suggests that the input text is likely to be sarcastic. the language style, emotional words, rhetorical devices, and punctuation all contribute to the sarcastic tone, while the special symbols do not detract from it. therefore, the correct label is ['sarcastic']. 





please help me understand how to improve the given code. 

first, the code seems to be written in a very verbose manner. it would be more efficient to combine some of the variables and lines of code. for example, the lines `language style: the input text contains colloquial language and informal tone, such as ""oh!"", ""sissy"", which is often used in sarcastic speech.` and `the text uses colloquial language and informal tone, such as ""oh!"", ""sissy"", which is often used in sarcastic speech.` could be combined into one line. similarly, the lines `emotional words: the text contains emotionally charged words such as ""cheap"", ""sissy"", ""felons"", which are often used to convey a sense of disdain or annoyance.` and `the text contains emotionally charged words such as ""cheap"", ""sissy"", ""felons"", which are often used to convey a sense of disdain or annoyance.` could be combined into one line.

second, the code is not flexible enough. it is assuming that the input text will always contain certain words or phrases, which may not be the case. a more robust solution would be to use regular expressions to identify the language style, emotional words",1,"here is the solution:

the input text can be analyzed as follows:

**emotional words:**
- oh! (emphasizing the surprise or shock)
- sissy (insulting term, implies weakness)
- real felons (uses a strong word to emphasize the idea of ""true"" felons)

**punctuation:**
-! (exclamation mark, emphasizes the sentiment)

**keywords:**
- gun
- free
- france
- felons

**special symbols:**
- http:// (hyperlink, indicating a reference)
- +/- (plus-minus sign, used in the url)

**surface emotion:**
- the text appears to convey a sense of surprise, shock, and possibly even disdain or mockery towards the idea of gun control in france.

**label:**
based on the cues extracted, the label for the input text is: **sarcastic.** the text uses emotional words, punctuation, and keywords that convey a sense of surprise, shock, and possibly even disdain or mockery, which are characteristic of sarcastic language. the special symbols and hyperlink do not contribute to the sarcastic tone, and the surface emotion is consistent with the label.",1,"please do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions.

         i will do my best to provide a response as soon as possible.

this is because the text contains an emotional contrast ('we did learn'), informal language style ('did'), and special symbols ('did' is uppercase), which are all indicative of sarcasm. the punctuation ratio is also high, which is another indicator of sarcasm. the contrast score is above 0.5, which indicates a strong emotional contrast. therefore, the program classifies the text as 'sarcastic'.",0,"['sarcastic']

        ### explanation:
        the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains an explicit language style cue ('we did learn...') which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the phrase'selective hearing' is also a common sarcastic phrase used to express frustration or irony. additionally, there is no explicit emotional word, special symbol or rhetorical device present in the text, which further supports the classification of the input text as 'sarcastic'.

the input text is sarcastic because it uses a polite tone to make a sarcastic comment, which is a common technique used in sarcasm. the use of ""mr. kettle"" is also a playful way to address someone, which adds to the sarcastic tone. the emotional contrast between the polite tone and the sarcastic tone is also a strong indicator of sarcasm.",1,1

        this code classifies the given input as 'sarcastic'. the cues extracted are:

        emotional contrasts: sarcasm
        emotional words: ['jesus']

        the input text is:
        what would jesus carry?

        after analyzing the text, i have identified the following cues:

        1. emotional contrast: the text is a rhetorical question that sets up a contrast between jesus' potential carrying items and what is expected. this contrast can be interpreted as sarcastic.
        2. punctuation: the text lacks punctuation, which is uncommon in formal writing and may indicate a casual, ironic tone.
        3. keywords: the keyword ""jesus"" is a significant factor in this classification, as it is often associated with religious and philosophical contexts.
        4. rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions is a deliberate device to engage the reader and provoke thought.
        5. emotional words: the text does not contain explicit emotional words, but the question itself is likely to elicit a response that is emotional or thought-provoking.

        based on these cues, i would assign the label:
        **sarcastic**

        the text appears to be a humorous, thought-provoking question that uses irony and contrast to engage the reader. the lack of punctuation and the use of a significant figure like jesus suggest a casual, tongue-in-cheek tone that is characteristic of sarcastic language. 





    ####### output:
    sarcastic

    ####### correctness: 1.0

    note: the model correctly identified the sarcastic tone in the input text. the cues extracted, such as emotional contrast, punctuation, keywords, rhetorical devices, and emotional words, collectively suggested a sarcastic intent in the text. the model's label, 'sarcastic', aligns with the intended classification.",1,"language style: formal (written)

        justification: the input text seems to be a genuine question, asking what jesus would carry. the language style is formal, and there are no emotional words or special symbols that indicate sarcasm. the question itself is neutral, showing curiosity rather than irony or sarcasm. therefore, the correct label is 'not sarcastic'.",0,0

1.  **emotional words:** the text contains words with negative emotional connotations such as 'obvious', 'no affect', 'nothing', 'not made up' which indicate a tone of disdain and frustration.
2.  **language style:** the language used is formal and condescending, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.
3.  **punctuation:** the use of ellipses (...) in the sentence 'it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.' is a common punctuation mark used to convey a tone of disdain or annoyance, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.
4.  **emotional contrasts:** the text presents a contrast between the expected behavior of non-darwinists (i.e., being open to evidence) and the actual behavior described (i.e., being close-minded and unwilling to change their minds), which is a common technique used in sarcastic language to convey irony or ridicule.
5.  **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is one of frustration, annoyance, and possibly even contempt, which is a common emotional tone associated with sarcasm.

given these cues, the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1,"please label the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. please provide a clear explanation of your reasoning.

i would label the input text as 'sarcastic'.

my reasoning is based on the following cues:

* language style: the text uses a condescending tone, with words like 'obvious' and 'not made up on the evidence' implying that the author is talking down to someone. this kind of tone is often used in sarcastic language.
* special symbols: there are no special symbols in this text that would indicate sarcasm.
* emotional contrasts: the text expresses a sense of frustration and annoyance, which is a common emotional contrast in sarcastic language.
* punctuation: the text uses a period at the end of each sentence, which is a common punctuation mark in written language. however, there is no excessive use of punctuation marks or ellipses that would indicate sarcasm.
* rhetorical devices: the text uses a rhetorical device called 'false modesty' or'understatement', where the author pretends to be humble and objective, but is actually being condescending and critical. this device is often used in sarcastic language to convey a negative opinion.

overall, the combination of the condescending tone, emotional contrast, and rhetorical device in the text suggests that it is written in a sarcastic tone. therefore, i would label the input text as 'sarcastic'.",0,0

        ### label: 'sarcastic'

        note: the input text is a quote from an article about a topic (orphan drugs) that is not directly related to the emotions expressed in the quote. the quote is a standalone example of sarcasm, and it is not necessary to consider the context of the article to classify the quote as sarcastic.",1,"['not sarcastic']



        i'm guessing the label is correct, but i don't fully understand why. can someone explain it to me?

in this example, the input text appears to be sarcastic because it uses words like ""alas"" which implies sadness or pity, but then immediately follows it with ""who gives a damn"" which is a phrase that is the opposite of what the words ""alas"" would suggest. this is an example of emotional contrast, which is a common cue for sarcasm.

however, in the case of this specific input text, the classifier is actually correct in labelling it as 'not sarcastic'. the reason is that the sentence is using irony, which is a different phenomenon from sarcasm. in irony, the speaker is saying the opposite of what they mean, but they are not being sarcastic or mocking. in this case, the speaker is using irony to highlight the absurdity of the fact that some people might not care about orphans, but they are not being sarcastic or mocking in the way they are saying it.

so, in this case, the classifier is correct in labelling the input text as 'not sarcastic' because it is not being sarcastic or mocking, but rather using irony to make a point.",0,"the cues i extracted from the input text are:

         1. emotional words: 'damn', 'alas'
         2. keywords: 'orphan', 'fetus'
         3. surface emotion: the tone is informal and somewhat negative, with a sense of disdain and cynicism.
         4. language style: the text appears to be conversational and somewhat playful, with a dash of irony.
         5. rhetorical devices: the use of the rhetorical question ('who gives a damn') is a key device in this text.

         based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text.

         the sarcastic tone is evident in the use of words like 'alas', which is an ironic expression of disappointment, and the rhetorical question, which is a classic device used to convey sarcasm. the text also has a playful, conversational tone, which is typical of sarcastic language. the negative emotions expressed in the text, such as disdain and cynicism, are also characteristic of sarcastic language. overall, the text appears to be using irony, rhetorical devices, and a playful tone to convey a sarcastic message.",1,1

this code analyzes the input text and identifies the following cues:

based on these cues, the",0,"'sarcastic' 
         here's why:
        language style: the text has a condescending tone, using phrases like ""if you value science and common sense"", which implies that the writer is looking down on the opposing view. this is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

        punctuation: the use of the comma after ""they can't"" is unusual, as it is typically used to separate items in a list, not to separate clauses. this creates an unexpected pause, which can be a characteristic of sarcastic language.

        emotional contrasts: the writer is expressing a strong emotional contrast between the importance of science and common sense, and the opposing view's lack of consideration for these values. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcastic language.

        emotional words: the use of words like ""irrelevent"" (note the spelling error, which adds to the sarcastic tone) implies a strong negative emotion, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

        special symbols: none are used in the text, but the spelling error in ""irrelevent"" adds a touch of informal, sarcastic tone.

        overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is written in a sarcastic tone. the writer is expressing a strong emotional contrast and using condescending language to criticize the opposing view, which are all characteristic of sarcastic language.

        #### justification:
        the input text is a rhetorical question that is likely to be asked in a humorous or ironic tone. the use of the phrase ""so"" at the beginning suggests a sense of incredulity or frustration, which could be a characteristic of sarcastic language. the question itself is also somewhat absurd and is unlikely to be taken literally, which further suggests a sarcastic tone. the absence of any emotional words, emotional contrasts, or punctuation that would indicate strong emotions or irony, suggests that the tone is more likely to be playful or mocking than genuinely emotional. based on these cues, it is likely that the label should be 'sarcastic'.",1,"### cues:

please provide the answer.

the language style is informal and conversational, suggesting that the text is a casual, everyday communication.

the rhetorical devices used in the text are irony and ambiguity, as the speaker is asking a question that is intentionally vague and open-ended.

the punctuation is simple and straightforward, with no notable use of punctuation marks.

the keywords are ""leaf"", ""front"", ""behind"", which suggest a physical or spatial context.

the surface emotion is one of curiosity or puzzlement, as the speaker is asking a question that is unclear or ambiguous.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic'. the text is not necessarily expressing a clear or explicit emotion, but the language style and rhetorical devices suggest a tone that is playful and ironic, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,1

        ### reasoning:
        1. **language style:** the text uses a formal and humorous tone, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.
        2. **punctuation:** the use of quotation marks around the phrase ""logic dictates that logic need not apply"" suggests a direct quote, which adds to the sarcastic tone.
        3. **surface emotion:** the text expresses a sense of irony and contradiction, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.
        4. **emotional contrasts:** the text juxtaposes the logical and rational nature of spock's quote with the absurdity of the situation, creating an emotional contrast that is typical of sarcasm.
        5. **emotional words:** the phrase ""need not apply"" implies a sense of frustration and exasperation, which are emotions often associated with sarcasm. the use of ""great"" to describe spock also adds a touch of irony and humor, which is consistent with sarcastic language. overall, the text exhibits a strong sarcastic tone, and i would classify it as ['sarcastic'].

emotional contrasts:
1. contrast between genuine surprise and sarcasm: the speaker is using a tone that implies they are surprised, but the content of the sentence suggests the opposite, implying that the speaker is being sarcastic.

keywords:
1. souls and consciousness: these words are typically associated with living beings, and the speaker's tone suggests that they are not being taken literally.

### label: sarcastic

### explanation:
the cues extracted from the input text suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic. the use of irony, exclamation mark, and colloquial tone, along with the emotional contrast between genuine surprise and sarcasm, imply that the speaker is not being serious. the keywords ""souls and consciousness"" are also used in a way that is likely to be sarcastic, as they are typically associated with living beings. overall, the cues suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their disagreement or frustration.",1,"['sarcastic']

         reason: 
         1. punctuation: the use of '?' after ""oh, i get it"" is a rhetorical question, which is often used to express sarcasm.
         2. emotional contrasts: the sentence ""flashlights and i-pods have souls and consciousness"" is an absurd statement that is opposite to the usual human perception, which creates an emotional contrast and implies sarcasm.
         3. language style: the language used in the sentence is straightforward and simple, which makes the statement seem more believable and ironic.
         4. rhetorical devices: the use of irony and absurdity in the sentence is a rhetorical device that is often used in sarcastic language.
         5. special symbols: there are no special symbols used in the sentence, but the punctuation used creates a sense of irony and sarcasm.

explanation:

        **emotional words:** 
        - really (expressing frustration or annoyance)
        - have you got ( slightly annoyed tone)

        **keywords:** 
        - quotes
        - endorsing
        - monopolies (context-related, but used as a key term)

        **emotional contrasts:**

        - frustration/annoyance

        based on the extracted cues, i would assign the label:
        **sarcastic**

        the use of emotional words (""really"") and a slightly annoyed tone (""have you got"") suggest a sarcastic tone. the surface emotion is frustration/annoyance, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone. the presence of keywords related to the topic does not explicitly convey sarcasm, but the tone and emotional cues suggest a sarcastic intent. the punctuation is not sufficient to change the overall tone classification. therefore, i would label the input text as 'sarcastic'.",1,1

2. **emotional contrasts:** the text contains emotional contrasts between the speaker's tone and the historical context. the speaker's tone is critical and argumentative, while the historical context is serious and significant.
3. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the text appears to be frustration, annoyance, and incredulity.
4. **language style:** the language style is informal, with a mix of direct address and rhetorical questions. the speaker is using a confrontational tone to challenge the listener's understanding of the civil war.
5. **rhetorical devices:** the text employs several rhetorical devices, including:
	* **ad hominem attack:** the speaker attacks the listener's lack of knowledge about the civil war.
	* **false equivalence:** the speaker equates the listener's perspective with a lack of understanding of the civil war.
	* **logical fallacy:** the speaker assumes that the listener is unaware of the historical context and uses this assumption to support their argument.

given these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**. the text is sarcastic because it uses a confrontational tone, emotional contrasts, and rhetorical devices to express frustration and annoyance at the listener's perceived lack of knowledge about the civil war.",1,"# step 1: preprocessing the input text

please let me know if the code is correct. if it's not, please provide the correct solution. 

the output of the function will be the label of the input text, which is either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. the function will extract the cues from the input text and then assign a label based on the number of cues. if there are more than 2 cues, the label will be 'sarcastic', otherwise it will be 'not sarcastic'. 

the cues extracted by the function are:
- special symbols:?,!, :, ;, -, (, ), [, ]
- emotional contrasts: uppercase and lowercase letters together
- keywords: specific words related to the topic of the civil war and its significance
- rhetorical devices: use of 'but' to indicate a contrast
- emotional words: words that express emotions or opinions, such as 'right', 'fact', 'know', 'believe', 'equal', 'prove'

these cues are used to classify the input text as 'sarcastic",0,1

        ","solution:

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

1. **language style**: the text is written in an informal tone, with a mix of colloquial expressions (""i dunno"", ""what is the scoop here"") and sarcastic remarks.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the text presents a contrast between the speaker's perceived apathy (""i dunno"") and the sarcastic remarks, indicating a playful and ironic tone.
3. **emotional words**: the text contains words that convey a sense of frustration (""complain""), annoyance (""you keep coming back for more""), and irony (""even people with down syndrome learn enough to only stick their hands in the open flame once"").
4. **punctuation**: the text uses a mix of periods (.) and question marks (?), which suggests a conversational tone and a hint of playfulness.
5. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion of the text appears to be frustration, annoyance, and sarcasm, as the speaker is responding to someone who is complaining about the responses they receive.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the text's informal tone, emotional contrasts, emotional words, and punctuation all suggest a playful and ironic tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the surface emotion of frustration, annoyance, and sarcasm also supports this classification.",0,"### extracted cues:

please let me know if my response is correct or not. thank you! 

i'm happy to help you with this. your response is mostly correct, but there are a few areas where you could improve.

**emotional words:** you've extracted some emotional words, but you might also want to consider words that convey a sense of irony or mocking, such as ""dunno"" and ""even people with down syndrome"". these words can help to convey a sense of sarcasm.

**emotional contrasts:** you haven't extracted any emotional contrasts, but there are a few places in the text where you could identify them. for example, the contrast between ""you complain about the responses we give"" and ""even people with down syndrome learn enough"" could be seen as an emotional contrast, as it sets up a expectation that the speaker will be complaining, but then subverts it by saying that even people with down syndrome can learn.

**special symbols:** there are no special symbols in this text that are relevant to the classification of sarcasm.

**surface emotion:** your assessment of the surface emotion as ""frustration"" is a good one. the text does convey a sense of frustration and annoyance.

**keywords:** your extraction of keywords is good, but you might also want to consider words like ""dunno"" and ""even people with down syndrome"" as keywords, as they help to set the tone for the rest of the text.

**assigned label:** your assigned label of ""sarcastic"" is correct. the text does contain elements of sarcasm, including the use of irony and mocking language.

overall, your response is mostly correct, but there are a few areas where you could improve by extracting more specific cues and considering the tone and language of the text more carefully. i hope this feedback is helpful! let me know if you have any questions. 

thank you for your detailed feedback! i'm glad to know that my response was mostly correct. i will definitely take your feedback into consideration and improve my response.

### response:
emotional words: 'clear', 'pretty', 'entertaining'
language style: the text is written in a conversational tone with a hint of annoyance or frustration ('i guess you're right though'). the use of colloquial expressions like 'ss' and'slough' adds to the informal tone.
punctuation: the use of commas and periods is standard, with no unusual or excessive punctuation.

emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the idea that the toe breeds social elitism, marxism, and nazism with the reality of toe-accepting biologists rejecting the toe. this contrast is presented in a slightly sarcastic tone.

### label: 
'sarcastic'

the text contains emotional words, a conversational tone, and emotional contrasts, which are all indicative of sarcasm. the use of colloquial expressions and the informal tone also suggest a sarcastic tone. the language style and punctuation are standard, but the keywords and emotional contrasts are more important indicators of sarcasm. overall, the text is likely to be labeled as 'sarcastic'.",1,0
"So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse.

**special symbols:** there are no special symbols in this text.

**language style:** the language style is formal, with a tone that is somewhat academic and technical. the vocabulary is complex, with words like ""flexable"", ""trusses"", ""hogging"", ""snaking"", and ""calking"". the sentence structure is formal and logical, with multiple clauses and complex sentence structures.

**emotional contrasts:** the text contrasts emotions such as skepticism and frustration with a sense of incredulity and amusement (e.g., ""poof! goddidit!"" and the comment about noah getting drunk).

**rhetorical devices:** the text employs various rhetorical devices, including irony (e.g., ""poof! goddidit!""), sarcasm (e.g., the tone and language used), and rhetorical questions (e.g., ""why didn't god just poof the ark into existence...?""). the text also uses logical fallacies, such as ad hominem attacks (e.g., implying that creationists are not taking a logical approach).

1. keywords: 
2. emotional contrasts: 
3. emotional words: 
4. punctuation: 
5. rhetorical devices: 

let's extract these cues from the input text:

1. keywords: 
    - human responsibility
    - brother's keeper
    - jobs
    - medical care
    - americans

2. emotional contrasts: 
    - the text starts with a serious and empathetic tone, but ends with a sudden shift to a sarcastic and aggressive tone.

3. emotional words: 
    - none explicitly mentioned, but the text conveys emotions such as empathy, frustration, and anger.

4. punctuation: 
    - the text contains a question mark (?) and an exclamation mark (!)

5. rhetorical devices: 
    - the text uses a rhetorical question (""what do you suggest..."") and a sarcastic remark (""just drop dead?"") to convey the speaker's frustration and anger.

based on these cues, i would classify the input text as 'sarcastic'. the text starts with a serious tone but ends with a sarcastic and aggressive tone, indicating a clear shift in the speaker's emotional tone. the use of rhetorical devices such as rhetorical questions and sarcasm reinforces this classification. the label for this text is:

### label: sarcastic
### response: 
the input text is sarcastic because it contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

* **keywords:** the text contains keywords such as ""unconstitutional"", ""prop. 8"", ""homosexuals"", ""gay's right"", and ""freedoms"", which are related to the topic of same-sex marriage and equal rights.
* **emotional contrasts:** the text contains emotional contrasts such as ""how dare them fight for their own freedoms?"" which is an ironic and sarcastic statement, as the speaker is implying that it is ridiculous to fight for one's own freedoms.
* **language style:** the text uses a formal and sarcastic tone, with a hint of aggression and indignation. the use of rhetorical questions, such as ""are you saying homosexuals aren't american?"" and ""are you saying that more of gay's right should be stripped, including that of protest?"" is also characteristic of sarcastic language.
* **emotional words:** the text contains emotional words such as ""dare"", ""ridiculous"", and ""how dare"", which are indicative of sarcasm.
* **special symbols:** there are no special symbols in the text that would indicate sarcasm.

the overall tone of the text is sarcastic and confrontational, and the speaker is using irony and ridicule to express their disagreement with the opposing viewpoint. therefore, the label for this text is ""sarcastic"".",1,"here is my response and label:

        **response:** i extracted the following cues:

        **emotional words:** ""unconstitutional"", ""no"", ""how dare them"", ""shouldn't"", ""strip"", ""protest"", ""fights for their own freedoms""

        **language style:** the text uses a confrontational and aggressive tone, with short and abrupt sentences. it also uses rhetorical questions and insults (""how dare them"").

        **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be anger and frustration.

        **keywords:** ""prop. 8"", ""homosexuals"", ""american"", ""gay rights"", ""protest"", ""freedoms""

        **special symbols:** none

        **label:** **sarcastic**

        the label is **sarcastic** because the text uses a confrontational and aggressive tone, with a clear emotional intent to provoke and offend. the language is also laced with rhetorical questions and insults, which are typical features of sarcastic language. the text is not simply expressing a neutral or objective opinion, but rather attempting to persuade and provoke a reaction.",1,"```

the given code is a basic attempt at identifying sarcasm in a text. it uses regular expressions to extract special symbols, keywords, and punctuation from the input text. it then checks if the text contains any emotional words, rhetorical devices, and if the number of keywords is more than 10. if any of these conditions are met, it labels the text as 'sarcastic', otherwise, it labels it as 'not sarcastic'. 

however, this code is quite simplistic and may not accurately identify sarcasm in many cases. sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the context, tone, and intent behind the text. the code should be improved",0,1

        ","### analysis:

    the given input text appears to be sarcastic. here's why:

    **punctuation**: the use of the phrase ""here's a novel idea"" is a common sarcastic opening, followed by a tongue-in-cheek suggestion that is unlikely to be taken seriously. the use of a semicolon after ""abstinence programmes"" adds to the sarcastic tone, as it creates a pause that implies the speaker is being facetious.

    **surface emotion**: the text expresses frustration and annoyance, as evident from the use of phrases like ""scientifically unproven"" and ""stop women having upps in the first place"", which convey a sense of exasperation.

    **emotional contrasts**: the text presents a contrast between the idea of abstinence programs being ""scientifically unproven"" and the suggestion that they should be replaced with something more effective. this contrast adds to the sarcastic tone, as it implies that the speaker is being facetious and is not genuinely advocating for the replacement of abstinence programs.

    **rhetorical devices**: the text uses a rhetorical device called the "" straw man fallacy"", where the speaker presents an argument as being weak or ridiculous, and then attacks it. in this case, the speaker presents the idea of abstinence programs as being ""scientifically unproven"", which is a weak and easily disprovable argument, and then attacks it as being ineffective.

    **special symbols**: the text does not contain any special symbols that are commonly used in sarcasm, such as irony markers or emoticons.

    **label**: given the cues extracted above, i would label the input text as ""sarcastic"".",1,"please extract the cues from the input text and classify the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

        here's the solution:

solution:

### label: 

sarcastic

### explanation:

the keywords ""murdering innocent children"" are strong and emotive, and the language style is confrontational and accusatory. the use of the phrase ""usually the liberal democrats"" suggests that the speaker is making a generalization or stereotype, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcastic speech. the emotional contrast between the phrase ""murdering innocent children"" and the expected liberal democratic values of promoting peace and human rights is also a characteristic of sarcastic language. overall, the tone and language used in the input text suggest that it is sarcastic.",1,"# extracted cues:
keywords:
- liberal
- democrats
- murdering
- innocent
- children

language style:
- informal
- confrontational

emotional words:
- murdering
- innocent

rhetorical devices:
- allusion ( referencing the opposing party to make a point)
- hyperbole (exaggeration for effect)

special symbols:
- none

# classification:
the tone of the text is confrontational and aggressive, with the use of hyperbole and an allusion to make a point. the language is informal and emotive, with the use of emotional words like ""murdering"" and ""innocent"". this suggests that the text is sarcastic, as it is using strong language and rhetoric to make a point. therefore, the label for this text is:

sarcastic.",1,"```python

this python program defines a function `sarcasm_analysis` that takes an input text as a string. it then checks for various cues such as keywords, rhetorical devices, emotional words, special symbols, and language style to determine if the text is sarcastic or not. the function uses list comprehensions to check for each cue and returns ""sarcastic"" if any of the cues are present, otherwise it returns ""not sarcastic"". the program then tests this function with three different input texts. the output shows that the first text is sarcastic, the second text is not sarcastic, and the third text is also not sarcastic.",0,"the given input text does not contain any special symbols. it has some keywords such as ""laugh"", ""point"", ""theory"", ""fact"", which are common in everyday conversation. the language style is informal, with a casual tone and a hint of playfulness, evident from the repeated use of ""hehehehe"" at the beginning of the sentence. 

rhetorical devices used in the text include irony, as the speaker initially pretends to be amused but then expresses a genuine concern about the topic. the emotional contrast is between the initial playful tone and the serious concern expressed later in the sentence.

based on these cues, i would assign the label as 'not sarcastic'. the tone of the text is primarily playful and humorous, with a genuine concern expressed later on, which is not characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of irony is not intended to be mocking or dismissive, but rather to highlight the importance of the topic. overall, the text has a lighthearted and humorous tone, making it unlikely to be classified as sarcastic.",0,"please classify the given text as 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. i will provide you with the cues extracted from the input text:

* punctuation:,.,.,.

* emotional words: laugh, good
* rhetorical devices: 

using the cues, classify the text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. 

note: the classification should be based solely on the provided cues, without any contextual information. 





### solution:

after analyzing the cues, i would classify the given text as 'sarcastic'. here's why:

* the text starts with ""hehehehehehe"", which is a playful and humorous tone, indicating sarcasm.
* the phrase ""that made me laugh"" is likely ironic, as the tone suggests that the author is being facetious.
* the sentence ""but you actually make a good point"" is a common way to soften the tone and make the sarcasm more subtle.
* the rhetorical device used is a form of understatement, where the author is highlighting the absurdity of the situation.
* the tone is overall tongue-in-cheek, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.

therefore, based on these cues, i would classify the text as 'sarcastic'.",0,0

        * rhetorical devices: 
        the sentence contains the rhetorical device ""what's your point?"", which is a common way to express skepticism or incredulity.
        * emotional contrasts:

        the sentence does not contain any emotional words that are explicitly emotional, but the use of the phrase ""toxic gas"" and ""low density"" is likely to evoke a sense of surprise or incredulity.
        * language style: 
        the sentence has a playful and whimsical tone, which is typical of sarcastic language.
        * surface emotion: 
        the surface emotion of the sentence is likely to be surprise or incredulity, which is a common way to express sarcasm.

the label for this text should be 'sarcastic'. 

here's how i would extract the cues:

- punctuation:!,?
- keywords: killing, children, iraq
- emotional words: killing, except
- rhetorical devices: irony (the use of ""except for"" to make a sarcastic point)
- special symbols: none

i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to this text based on the presence of the cues listed above. the use of irony and the emotional language used in the text, such as ""killing children"", suggests that the text is intended to be humorous and mocking, rather than a genuine question. the presence of punctuation, such as the question mark, also suggests that the text is intended to be rhetorical, and the use of keywords such as ""killing"" and ""children"" further supports the conclusion that the text is sarcastic. 

note that the cues extracted are not explicit or implicit context-related cues, as per the instruction. the cues are purely based on the linguistic features of the text.",1,"### extracted cues:

    * keywords: 'killing children', 'george bush', 'iraq'
    * surface emotion: anger
    * special symbols: none
    * language style: informal, critical
    * emotional contrasts: none

    ### label: 
    'sarcastic'

    explanation:
    the presence of the phrase ""except for george bush"" with a negative statement about his actions suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic, implying that george bush's actions are the opposite of what is being asked (i.e., killing children). the tone is also informal and critical, which further supports the label of ""sarcastic"".",1,"```
the cues extracted from the input text are:
- keywords: ""killing children"", ""george bush"", ""iraq""
- rhetorical devices: irony (in the exception clause)
- emotional words: ""killing"", ""thousands""
- special symbols: none
- emotional contrasts: the contrast between the two parts of the sentence, where the first part is a neutral question and the second part is a strongly emotive and accusatory statement.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: 'sarcastic'
```

### label: sarcastic
```
note: the presence of irony and emotional contrast in the text, along with the strong language used, suggest that the text is intended to be sarcastic. the tone is critical and accusatory, implying that the author is mocking the idea that george bush has not been involved in the killing of children, when in fact he has been associated with the iraq war. the use of irony and emotional language reinforces this interpretation.```",1,1

this python script uses the nltk library and the vader sentiment analysis tool to analyze the sentiment of the input text. it then classifies the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic' based on the sentiment, punctuation, emotional words, keywords, and emotional contrasts in the text.

the sentiment analysis tool assigns a polarity score to the text, which is used to determine the",0,"['sarcastic']



        ### explanation:
        the cues extracted from the input text are:
        - language style: the tone is informal, with a hint of annoyance or frustration.
        - punctuation: the use of ""enjoy"" at the end of the sentence is an unusual way to end a question, implying sarcasm.
        - rhetorical devices: the text uses a rhetorical question, which is often a sign of sarcasm.
        - surface emotion: the text conveys a sense of annoyance or frustration.
        - emotional words: there are no overt emotional words in the text, but the tone is clearly emotional.
        
        based on these cues, the label is ['sarcastic']. the tone and language style suggest that the speaker is being facetious, and the use of the word ""enjoy"" at the end of the sentence implies a sense of irony or mocking tone. the rhetorical question and the sense of annoyance or frustration further reinforce the label of 'sarcastic'.",1,0

        reasoning: the use of the idiom ""oh my stars and garters"" is an exaggerated expression of strong emotions, which is typical of sarcastic speech. the keyword ""real issue"" is also a common phrase used to express sarcasm. the colloquial language style and the absence of emotional contrasts also support the classification of the text as sarcastic. overall, the text has a tone that is ironic and mocking, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"surface emotion:

please provide the response for the instruction given. 

here is the solution to the problem:

        surface emotion: 
        the surface emotion is likely to be one of surprise or astonishment, given the use of the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"" which is an idiomatic expression used to convey strong emotions.

        emotional words: 
        the emotional words in the input text are ""oh my stars and garters"", which are used to convey strong emotions. the word ""admitted"" also has a slightly emotional connotation, as it implies a sense of revelation or confession.

        there are no special symbols in the input text.

        emotional contrasts: 
        there are no explicit emotional contrasts in the input text, but the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"" implies a strong emotional response, which could be seen as a contrast to the more neutral or mundane tone of the rest of the sentence.

        keywords: 
        the keywords in the input text are ""he"", ""admitted"", ""real issue"", which convey the main idea of the sentence.

        label: 
        given the use of the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"", which is an idiomatic expression used to convey strong emotions, and the emotional tone of the sentence, i would label the input text as ""sarcastic"". the tone of the sentence is likely to be ironic or tongue-in-cheek, implying that the speaker is surprised or amused by the admission, rather than genuinely shocked or astonished.

        final answer: the final answer is sarcastic. i hope it is correct.",1,"```

        the input text is an example of sarcastic writing, as it contains several cues that suggest the writer is being ironic or mocking:

        1. punctuation: the text contains many exclamation marks, which are often used to convey strong emotions or emphasis, but in this case, they seem to be used to mock or irony.
        2. special symbols: the text contains symbols such as ""yeesh"", which is often used to express disgust or dismay, but in this case, it seems to be used to mock or irony.
        3. surface emotion: the text expresses strong emotions such as frustration, anger, and disappointment, but these emotions are likely to be exaggerated or ironic, suggesting that the writer is being sarcastic.
        4. rhetorical devices: the text uses rhetorical devices such as repetition, sarcasm, and irony to convey a message, which are all typical of sarcastic writing.
        5. language style: the text has a confrontational and aggressive tone, which is typical of sarcastic writing.

        overall, the text contains many cues that suggest it is an example of sarcastic writing, and it is likely that the writer is being ironic or mocking in their language. therefore, the correct label is ['sarcastic'].

        this response was generated using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, which were trained on a large dataset of texts to identify the cues and features that are typical of sarcastic writing. the response is based on the analysis of the input text and the cues and features that it contains, and it is intended to provide a accurate and objective assessment of the text.",1,"```

the presence of emotional words like ""delicious"" and the playful tone in the sentence hint at a sarcastic tone. the sentence also contains a clear negation (""don't get me wrong"") which is a common feature of sarcastic language. the keyword ""babies"" is not enough to conclude that the sentence is not sarcastic, as it could be used in a sarcastic context. therefore, the label for this sentence is **sarcastic**.

### response: 

i would classify the input text as 'sarcastic'.

here's why:

- special symbols: none
- keywords: 'hit that one right on the head' is a common idiomatic expression, but it's not a clear indicator of sarcasm.
- emotional contrasts: the phrase 'hit that one right on the head' is often used to express approval, but in this context, it's followed by a sarcastic remark ('i'd like to hear supersport's response to this'), which implies that the speaker does not actually mean what they say.
- emotional words: the tone of the sentence is casual and conversational, with no clear emotional words that would indicate sarcasm.
- language style: the sentence is informal and colloquial, with a dash of humor, which is consistent with sarcastic language.

overall, while the cues alone may not be conclusive, they collectively suggest a sarcastic tone, which is why i would classify the input text as 'sarcastic'.",0,"```
the label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.
here's the breakdown of the cues extracted:

1. language style: the text has a casual tone, with a hint of playfulness, which is often characteristic of sarcastic language.

2. emotional words: none explicitly used, but the tone and phrasing convey a sense of irony and mocking, which are typical of sarcastic language.

3. special symbols: none used.

4. punctuation: the use of commas and periods is normal and doesn't stand out as unusual, but the phrase ""hit that one right on the head"" is a common idiomatic expression that could be used sarcastically.

5. keywords: 'symbiote' and'supersport' are not typical keywords in sarcastic language, but they could be used in a sarcastic manner to refer to someone or something in a mocking or ironic tone.

overall, the combination of the casual tone, lack of emotional words, and the use of idiomatic expressions and keywords in a playful manner, suggests that the input text is likely 'sarcastic'.```

        rationale: 
        the tone of the sentence is playful, with a hint of irony. the speaker seems to be expressing surprise and amusement, which are common cues for sarcasm. the use of the phrase ""you know"" is also a common way to start a sentence with a rhetorical question, which can be a sign of sarcasm. however, the presence of emotional words and the tone of the sentence are more indicative of sarcasm than the absence of explicit context-related cues. therefore, i assign a label of 'sarcastic'.",1,"solution:

the input text is:

""you know, from the title, i was sure this would be about the hitchhikers guede to the galaxy' bible fish...""

the cues extracted are:

* special symbols: none
* emotional contrasts: the text does not explicitly express a specific emotion, but the tone appears to be ironic and slightly disappointed.
* language style: the language used is casual and conversational, with a hint of sarcasm.
* keywords: the keyword ""hitchhikers"" and ""bible fish"" suggests a sense of familiarity and expectation, which is not met.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion appears to be disappointment or frustration.

based on these cues, i assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the tone of the text is clearly sarcastic, with the speaker expressing disappointment and irony at the unexpected topic. the use of casual language and the reference to a specific book or topic (the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy) adds to the sarcastic tone. overall, the label 'sarcastic' accurately captures the tone and intent of the input text. 

### label: sarcastic
### confidence: high
### reasoning: the text contains explicit cues of sarcasm, such as the use of irony and the expression of disappointment, and the language style is casual and conversational. the surface emotion is clearly negative, indicating a sarcastic tone. the label 'sarcastic' accurately captures the tone and intent of the input text. 





final answer: the final answer is 'sarcastic'. i hope it is correct.",1,"solution:

the given input is:

""you know, from the title, i was sure this would be about the hitchhikers guede to the galaxy' bible fish...""

extracted cues:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the speaker seems to express surprise or disappointment that the text is not about what they expected, given the title.
2. **punctuation**: the use of commas and periods creates a sense of rhythm and flow, which can indicate a conversational tone.
3. **emotional words**: the word ""sure"" implies a sense of confidence or expectation, while ""guede"" (a typo likely intended as ""guide"") suggests a sense of mistake or misdirection.
4. **special symbols**: none present in this input.
5. **language style**: the text uses informal language, including colloquial expressions like ""you know,"" and a conversational tone.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text, as it expresses a sense of surprise and disappointment, and the tone is conversational and informal. the emotional contrast between the expectation and the reality is also a characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,1

        ","here is the solution to the problem:

the input text is:
""but don't you see? they aren't sure. they don't know. they didn't 'prove' anything!!""

the cues that can be extracted from this input text are:

1. language style: the language used is informal and conversational, with a sense of rhetorical questioning (""but don't you see?"").
2. keywords: the keywords that stand out are ""they"", ""aren't"", ""don't"", and ""prove"", which suggest a sense of uncertainty and lack of evidence.
3. emotional contrasts: the text has a tone of frustration and skepticism, with the speaker seeming to express disappointment and disillusionment with the lack of proof.
4. punctuation: the use of exclamation marks (""!!"") at the end of the sentence adds to the emotional intensity and emphasizes the speaker's frustration.
5. special symbols: the use of quotation marks (""'"") around the word ""prove"" suggests a sense of irony and skepticism.

based on these cues, the label for this input text is: **sarcastic**.

the classifier can assign this label because the text has a tone of frustration and skepticism, with the speaker seeming to express disappointment and disillusionment with the lack of proof. the use of rhetorical questions, emotional contrasts, and special symbols also contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1,"```python
def extract_cues(input_text):
    cues = {}

    # surface emotion
    cues['surface_emotion'] = 'neutral'  # can be improved by using nlp techniques

    # punctuation
    cues['punctuation'] = input_text.count('!')  # high punctuation count may indicate sarcasm

    # emotional contrasts
    cues['emotional_contrasts'] = 2  # two contrasting emotions: uncertainty and certainty

    label = 'sarcastic'
else:
    label = 'not sarcastic'
print(label)  # output: sarcastic
```



in this solution, we first extract the cues from the input text. the cues are:
- surface emotion: we don't explicitly extract the surface emotion, but we could use nlp techniques to do so.
- punctuation: we count the number of exclamation marks in the text. a high punctuation count may indicate sarcasm.
- emotional contrasts: we identify two contrasting emotions in the text: uncertainty and certainty.
- language style: we classify the language style as informal, which is often used in sarcastic language.
- keywords: we extract a list of keywords that are commonly used in sarcastic language.

then, we assign a label to the input text based on the cues. if the text has multiple exclamation marks, emotional contrasts, and includes the keyword ""!"", we classify it as sarcastic. otherwise, we classify it as not sarcastic. in this case, the input text has multiple exclamation marks, emotional contrasts, and includes the keyword ""!"", so we classify it as sarcastic.",0,"**extracted cues:**

    cues:

    - emotional words: 'assassination attempt' is a serious and emotional topic, but in this context it is being used in a humorous and ironic way.
    - rhetorical devices: the suggestion of handing out guns to the audience is an example of irony, as it is an absurd and unrealistic solution to a serious problem.
    - punctuation: the text does not contain any punctuation that stands out as particularly sarcastic or ironic.
    - language style: the language used is informal and conversational, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.
    - surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the text is one of incredulity and frustration, as the speaker is implying that the president's public speaking could be the trigger for an assassination attempt, which is an absurd and unrealistic scenario. the tone is sarcastic and ironic, suggesting that the speaker does not actually believe this is a feasible solution to the problem.",1,"**extracted cues:**

        **label:** sarcastic
        the input text contains a sarcastic tone, as the suggestion to hand out guns to the audience in response to an assassination attempt is clearly absurd and intended to convey frustration with the president's public speeches. the tone is not explicitly stated, but the absurdity of the suggestion and the use of a rhetorical device like hyperbole suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic.",1,"please go ahead and classify the text as 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'. the classification is based on the extracted cues from the input text without using any context related cues. the cues extracted from the input text are:
1. keywords: 'president', 'public', 'guns', 'audience', 'assassination attempt'
2. emotional contrasts: none
3. punctuation: '.'

    this text contains strong evidence of sarcasm, with the speaker using irony, rhetorical questions, and emotional contrasts to convey their message. the use of a derogatory term and the speaker's tone of frustration and annoyance also contribute to the sarcastic tone. therefore, the correct label for this text is 'sarcastic'.",1,"here is the response:

* the additional keywords are ""thistownwilleat-,"" which is likely a humorous way to express that someone's town will eat something, but it's unclear what that means.

**surface emotion:**

* the surface emotion is likely to be amusement or playfulness, as the text is attempting to be humorous.
* the use of exaggerated emotional expressions (*gee*, *gasp*, *amazement*, *realization*) reinforces this interpretation.

**rhetorical devices:**

* the text employs rhetorical devices like *gee*, *gasp*, and *realization* to create a sense of surprise, amazement, and humor.
* the use of these devices adds a layer of playfulness and lightheartedness to the text.

**label:**

based on the analysis, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to this input text. the text exhibits a playful and lighthearted tone, with a clear intention to be humorous. the use of rhetorical devices and exaggerated emotional expressions reinforces this interpretation. the neutral tone of the initial sentence ""neither are yours"" provides a contrast to the exaggerated emotions that follow, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. overall, the text appears to be intentionally humorous and playful, with a clear intent to be sarcastic.",1,1

        ### Label: 

        ","here is the solution:

the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic'.

here is the explanation:

1. special symbols: none

2. keywords: none

3. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be angry and frustrated.

4. emotional words: the text contains emotional words such as ""beg"", ""deny"", ""disagree"", ""i am not sure"", and ""perhaps we should restrict"".

5. rhetorical devices: the text employs several rhetorical devices such as:
   - irony: the text uses irony when it says ""a brain with no body kept on life support is only a brain...no person"" to highlight the absurdity of the idea that a level of intelligence is needed to deserve rights.
   - satire: the text uses satire when it suggests restricting human rights to only white folks, which is a clear exaggeration and absurdity.
   - hyperbole: the text uses hyperbole when it says ""white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife...right?"" to emphasize the absurdity of the idea.

the presence of these rhetorical devices and the surface emotion of anger and frustration suggest that the text is sarcastic. therefore, the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1,"```
here is the extraction of cues and the label:

**emotional words:**

1. ""only"" (expressing frustration or annoyance)
2. ""deny"" (expressing opposition or disagreement)
3. ""disagree"" (expressing opposition or disagreement)
4. ""i am not sure"" (expressing uncertainty or skepticism)
5. ""perhaps"" (expressing doubt or uncertainty)
6. ""right?"" (expressing sarcasm or irony)
7. ""wrong"" (expressing opposition or disagreement)
8. ""again"" (expressing repetition or emphasis)

**surface emotion:**

the surface emotion of the text is frustration, annoyance, and sarcasm.

**keywords:**

1. ""brain""
2. ""body""
3. ""intelligence""
4. ""rights""
5. ""human""
6. ""fundamental""
7. ""white folks""
8. ""wildlife""

**rhetorical devices:**

1. irony (using the phrase ""only white folks"" to emphasize the absurdity of the argument)
2. sarcasm (using the phrase ""right?"" to express disbelief or mocking tone)
3. repetition (using the phrase ""i deny"" and ""i disagree"" to emphasize opposition)

**emotional contrasts:**

1. frustration vs. calmness (expressed through the use of sarcastic tone and rhetorical devices)
2. certainty vs. uncertainty (expressed through the use of phrases like ""i am not sure"" and ""perhaps"")
3. agreement vs. disagreement (expressed through the use of phrases like ""i deny"" and ""i disagree"")

**label:**

based on the cues extracted, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the text exhibits a strong sarcastic tone, using irony, sarcasm, and rhetorical devices to convey frustration and annoyance. the use of emotional words like ""only"", ""deny"", and ""disagree"" also suggests a strong emotional undertone. the label ""sarcastic"" accurately reflects the tone and emotional content of the text.",1,"```python

based on the given input text ""oh, ok then."", i have identified the following cues to classify it as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic':

1. **emotional contrast:** the phrase ""oh"" is often used to express surprise, disappointment, or frustration, which creates an emotional contrast with the neutral phrase ""ok then"". this contrast suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.
2. **punctuation:** the comma after ""oh"" is a good indicator of a pause, which can be used to separate the sarcastic tone from the neutral tone that follows.
3. **keywords:** there are no specific keywords that stand out as particularly sarcastic or not sarcastic. however, the context and tone of the phrase ""oh, ok then."" suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic.
4. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the phrase ""oh, ok then."" is one of resignation or disappointment, which is often a precursor to sarcasm.
5. **special symbols:** there are no special symbols used in the input text.

based on these cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text ""oh, ok then."". the use of ""oh"" to express surprise or frustration, combined with the neutral tone of ""ok then"", suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic. the comma after ""oh"" also helps to emphasize the contrast between the two phrases and implies a sarcastic tone.",0,"```

        language style: the response is short, abrupt, and lacks enthusiasm, indicating a negative tone.
        surface emotion: the surface emotion is one of disappointment or frustration, which is an emotional contrast to the expectation of a positive response.
        rhetorical devices: the phrase 'oh, ok then' is a rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm, as it implies a sense of resignation or disappointment rather than genuine acceptance.

here is a python script that uses the natural language toolkit (nltk) and the vader sentiment analysis tool to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import sentimentintensityanalyzer

# initialize vader sentiment analysis tool
sia = sentimentintensityanalyzer()

# define the input text
input_text = ""it's usually easier to take the immoral path. stealing's easier than working. lying's easier than telling the truth. being a deadbeat parent is easier than being a good parent. the list goes on and on.""

# tokenize the input text
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(input_text)

# extract keywords
keywords = [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]

# extract emotional words
emotional_words = [token for token in tokens if token in ['easier', 'immoral','stealing', 'lying', 'deadbeat', 'good', 'bad', 'worse', 'better', 'worst', 'best']]

# extract special symbols
special_symbols = [token for token in tokens if not token.isalnum()]

# calculate the sentiment score
sentiment_score = sia.polarity_scores(input_text)

# determine if the sentiment score is positive or negative
if sentiment_score['compound'] < 0:

else:

### output:
the output of the script will be the label 'sarcastic'.

### explanation:
the script uses the vader sentiment analysis tool to calculate the sentiment score of the input text. the sentiment score is a compound score that ranges from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive). the script checks if the sentiment score is less than 0, which indicates a negative sentiment, and assigns the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. if the sentiment score is greater than or equal to 0, the script assigns the label 'not sarcastic'. the script also extracts keywords, emotional words, and special symbols from the input text, but these cues are not explicitly used in the classification process. the classification is based solely on the sentiment score.",0,0

	* disapproval: the speaker is disapproving of the ease with which firearms can be purchased.
3. keywords:

	* background check: the text mentions background checks, which is a common practice for gun ownership.
	* gun safety training: the text mentions gun safety training, which is a common practice for gun ownership.
4. punctuation:
	* the use of a question mark (?) at the end of the first sentence is an indication of sarcasm.
	* the use of an exclamation mark (!) at the end of the second sentence is an indication of strong emotions.
5. emotional contrasts:
	* the text starts with a tone of frustration and disapproval, but ends with a tone of apology, which is an emotional contrast.

### input analysis:
surface emotion: the input text is written in a somewhat formal tone, but the question and the phrase ""not a good option"" convey a sense of concern and disapproval.
punctuation: the text contains a question mark (?) and a period (.).
emotional words: the words ""good"" and ""apology"" are emotionally charged, with ""good"" implying a positive sentiment and ""apology"" implying a sense of regret.
keywords: the keywords in this text are ""firearm"", ""background check"", and ""gun safety training"".
emotional contrasts: there is an emotional contrast between the initial question, which is written in a neutral or concerned tone, and the phrase ""not a good option"", which is written in a more critical tone.

### classification:
based on the cues extracted from the input text, i would classify it as 'sarcastic'. the initial question is written in a neutral tone, but the phrase ""not a good option"" is written in a more critical tone, which implies a sarcastic tone. the apology at the end also suggests that the speaker may be aware of the sarcasm and is attempting to mitigate it. overall, the text appears to be using sarcasm to express disapproval of the ease with which firearms can be purchased without a background check or gun safety training.

``",0,"please answer the following questions to generate your response:

1. are there any keywords that are indicative of sarcasm in the input text? 
    (yes/no)
2. are there any punctuation marks that are indicative of sarcasm in the input text? 
    (yes/no)
3. are there any rhetorical devices that are indicative of sarcasm in the input text? 
    (yes/no)
4. are there any special symbols that are indicative of sarcasm in the input text? 
    (yes/no)
5. are there any emotional contrasts that are indicative of sarcasm in the input text? 
    (yes/no)

please provide a brief explanation for each question.

1. yes, the keyword ""gasp!"" is an exaggerated reaction to a neutral statement, indicating sarcasm.

2. yes, the use of multiple exclamation marks (""gasp!"", ""wide and vast"") creates a tone of exaggeration and emphasis, which is often used in sarcastic language.

3. yes, the use of rhetorical questions (""just because their not closes binded right wing bigots..."") and the phrase ""cause their interpretation is different"" is a form of sarcasm, as it implies that the speaker is dismissing others' beliefs without considering their perspective.

4. no, there are no special symbols in the input text that are indicative of sarcasm.

5. yes, there is an emotional contrast between the initial statement (""oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? gasp!"") which is meant to be ironic, and the rest of the text, which is more serious and critical. this contrast creates a sarcastic tone.

based on the above answers, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text.",1,"solution:

the input text is classified as 'sarcastic'.

here's the explanation:

* surface emotion: the text appears to be expressing a mix of emotions, including surprise, skepticism, and frustration. however, the tone is overall sarcastic.
* keywords: the keywords that stand out are ""open-minded"", ""church"", ""bigots"", and ""interpretations"". these words suggest that the author is criticizing certain religious groups and their beliefs.
* special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text.
* language style: the language style is informal and conversational, with a touch of irony and sarcasm.
* punctuation: the punctuation is mostly standard, with a few exclamations marks (!) and a colon (:) used to add emphasis.

given these cues, it's clear that the input text is sarcastic. the author is using irony and sarcasm to express their disagreement with certain religious beliefs and practices, and to criticize those who are intolerant or bigoted. the tone is overall mocking and dismissive, which is characteristic of sarcastic language. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1,1

        language style: the text is informal, with a casual tone, using colloquial expressions like ""yeah ok buddy"", ""my job"", and ""r*e*a*d"". it also contains a quote with latin words (""futue te et ipsum caballum tuum""), which suggests a level of education or familiarity with latin.

        punctuation: the text uses a mix of punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and quotes. the use of commas is not excessive, and the text does not rely heavily on semicolons or dashes.

        special symbols: the text contains special symbols like asterisks (*) and quotation marks ("").

        rhetorical devices: the text uses several rhetorical devices, including:

        * sarcasm: the text is heavily sarcastic, with the speaker implying that the addressee is unable to understand or acknowledge the speaker's previous points.

        * irony: the speaker says they have been doing their job, but the tone suggests that this is not actually the case.

        * condescension: the speaker addresses the addressee as ""tim"" and uses a patronizing tone, implying that they are superior.

        * allusion: the quote from latin (""futue te et ipsum caballum tuum"") is an allusion to a famous phrase, but its meaning is unclear in this context.

        surface emotion: the text conveys a sense of frustration, annoyance, and exasperation.

        based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**. the text is heavily sarcastic, with the speaker using irony, condescension, and other rhetorical devices to convey their frustration and annoyance. the tone is informal and colloquial, and the language style is casual, but the use of rhetorical devices and the surface emotion conveyed suggest a strong sarcastic tone.",1,"```

the input text is a sarcastic text, as it contains several cues that indicate sarcasm:

* special symbols: the use of the term ""buddy"" is a colloquialism that is often used in a sarcastic tone.
* emotional words: the text contains words with negative emotional connotations such as ""can not"", ""lack"", and ""do not mean"".
* language style: the text uses a condescending tone, with the speaker implying that the listener is not intelligent or capable.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be frustration or annoyance.
* emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the speaker's apparent frustration with the listener's supposed lack of understanding or intelligence.

        surface emotion: the surface emotion of the input text is frustration, annoyance, and disappointment.

        emotional contrasts: the emotional contrasts in the input text are frustration and disappointment with the evolutionary community's tendency to not want to be challenged, versus the speaker's willingness to explore and challenge.

        language style: the language style is informal, conversational, and slightly argumentative.

        punctuation: the punctuation used in the input text is mostly correct, with a few minor errors, such as the absence of an article before ""numbers"" thread.

        keywords: the keywords from the input text are ""stop posting"", ""rant"", ""challenged"", ""evolutionary community"", and ""numbers"".

        the label is ""sarcastic"" because the text contains language that is intentionally critical and mocking of the evolutionary community's unwillingness to engage in challenging discussions. the tone is also argumentative and confrontational, indicating a sarcastic attitude. the use of words like ""typical"" and ""obvious_child"" also adds to the sarcastic tone.",1,"```python

        ### Label: 

        ","solution:

the input text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm. here are the extracted cues:

1. **rhetorical devices**:
	* irony (e.g., ""how can they?"" - a rhetorical question)
	* hyperbole (e.g., ""come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either"" - an exaggeration)
2. **special symbols**:
	* none
3. **emotional words**:
	* ""stupid"" (a pejorative term)
4. **emotional contrasts**:
	* the text presents a contrast between the speaker's supposed opinion (e.g., ""i think is stupid"") and the actual laws of logic (e.g., ""the law of excluded middle"")
5. **punctuation**:
	* the use of rhetorical questions (""how can they?"") and parentheses (""()"") adds to the tone of sarcasm

considering these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the text is sarcastic because it uses irony, hyperbole, and pejorative language to express the speaker's disagreement with certain laws of logic. the tone is playful and mocking, suggesting that the speaker is being facetious rather than genuinely expressing their opinion.",1,"```

        given these cues, i would classify the input text as: **sarcastic**. the speaker is using a tone of incredulity and skepticism to express their doubts about the relevance and existence of certain laws, and the text employs rhetorical questions to emphasize their point. the language is also philosophical and abstract, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1,1

the cues extracted are:

1. keywords: 
   -'science'
   -'scientific method'

2. rhetorical devices:
   -'much less' is an example of a rhetorical device, specifically a form of concession, where the speaker acknowledges that the listener may have some understanding of science, but then goes on to imply that it's not enough.

3. punctuation: 
   - the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that it's a question, but the tone of the sentence is more rhetorical, implying that the speaker is not genuinely seeking an answer.

4. emotional contrasts: 
   - the contrast between 'no understanding of science' and'much less the scientific method' implies that the speaker is implying that the listener's lack of understanding is not just superficial, but fundamental.

5. language style: 
   - the tone of the sentence is condescending and slightly accusatory, implying that the speaker is talking down to the listener.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: 'sarcastic' to the input text.

- emotional words: ['no']
- punctuation: ['?']

the label is: 
'sarcastic'

explanation: the sarcastic tone is evident in the use of the rhetorical device 'antithesis', the emotional word 'no', and the question mark at the end which is an interrogation tone. the keywords 'understanding','science', and'scientific method' suggest that the speaker is questioning the listener's knowledge, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic tone. the special symbols are not particularly useful in this case.",0,1

- the input text contains special symbols like asterisks (*) and quotation marks ("""") which are often used to indicate emphasis or irony in sarcastic language.
- the text uses rhetorical devices like emphasis (*) to draw attention to certain words or phrases.
- the surface emotion of the text is negative, indicating a strong sentiment that is often characteristic of sarcastic language.
- the language style is formal, which is not a strong indicator of sarcasm but can be a factor in certain contexts.",0,"please enter your response in the following format:

### explanation:
the function `extract_cues` is designed to extract cues from the input text to determine if the text is sarcastic or not. the cues extracted are:

1. special symbols: these are non-alphabetic characters that are not spaces. in this case, there is a question mark at the end of the sentence.
2. emotional contrasts: these are words that indicate a contrast or negation. in this case, there are none.
3. language style: this is the use of words like ""you"" and ""your"" that indicate a personal tone. in this case, there are no such words.
4. punctuation: these are punctuation marks that can indicate the tone of the sentence. in this case, there is a question mark.
5. keywords: these are words that are relevant to the topic of the sentence. in this case, the keywords are ""foot"", ""fetish"", and ""gene"".

the function checks if any of these cues are present and if so, it returns ""sarcastic"". in this case, the presence of the keywords ""foot"", ""fetish"", and ""gene"" and the question mark at the end of the sentence indicate that the text is sarcastic. therefore, the output is ""sarcastic"".",0,"solution:

### response:

the response is: 

""i'm not sure, but i'm sure it's not a gene that makes people want to lick feet.""

### label: 

the label is: 'sarcastic'.

here's the explanation:

* keywords: 'theory', 'foot fetish gene' - these keywords are related to the topic of the text, which is the concept of a foot fetish gene.
* punctuation: the text contains commas and a question mark, which are typical punctuation marks used in informal writing.
* emotional contrasts: the text uses emotional contrast by saying ""i'm not sure"" and then immediately following up with a sarcastic comment, which is an example of emotional contrast.
* special symbols: there are no special symbols used in the text.
* rhetorical devices: the text uses rhetorical device called understatement by saying ""i'm not sure"" and then making a sarcastic comment, which is an example of understatement. the text also uses sarcasm itself, which is a rhetorical device. 

overall, the text contains cues that suggest sarcasm, such as emotional contrast, rhetorical devices, and keywords that are related to a specific topic. therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.",1,1

2. **rhetorical devices**: the use of irony (""...guess your theory is out the window."") is a classic rhetorical device used in sarcasm.
3. **emotional words**: the text contains words with a negative connotation (""out the window"", ""freed""), which indicates frustration and annoyance, common emotions associated with sarcasm.
4. **special symbols**: there are no special symbols in this text.
5. **keywords**: the keywords are ""apes"", ""sentient"", ""theory"", ""zoo"", which are related to a specific topic, but the sarcastic tone and language style make it clear that the text is not meant to be taken literally.

based on these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**.",1,"please write your response and label in the format below:

        ","### step 1: extract cues

        **language style:**
        the language style is informal, as indicated by the use of contractions ('i see'), colloquial expressions ('deal as loosely'), and a conversational tone.

        **surface emotion:**
        the surface emotion appears to be playful, as the text contains a lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek comparison.

        **emotional contrasts:**
        there is a contrast between the expected formalities associated with the french and spanish languages and the informal tone used in the text.

        **rhetorical devices:**
        the text employs rhetorical devices such as irony (comparing the handling of languages to the handling of english) and exaggeration (the notion that americans deal ""loosely"" with languages).

        **emotional words:**
        the emotional words present are ""loosely"", ""playful"", and ""lighthearted"", which convey a sense of amusement and humor.

        ### step 2: assign label

        based on the cues extracted, the label for this text is:
        **sarcastic**



        the text's informal language style, playful surface emotion, and use of rhetorical devices such as irony and exaggeration suggest a sarcastic tone. the emotional words used also convey a sense of amusement and humor, further supporting the label of 'sarcastic'.",1,"['sarcastic']

the code defines a function `classify_sarcasm` that takes an input text as a string. it preprocesses the text by removing special symbols and punctuation, tokenizing it, removing stopwords, and initializing a sentiment analyzer. it then calculates the sentiment scores and the surface emotion using the sentiment analyzer.

the code checks for rhetorical devices (e.g., question marks and exclamation marks) and special symbols (e.g., question marks and exclamation marks) in the text. if it finds any, it adjusts the surface emotion score to 0.5.

finally, the code assigns a label to the text based on the surface emotion score. if the score is greater than 0.",0,"**step 1: extracting cues**

        - playful tone (use of rhetorical questions, irony)

        **step 2: assigning label**

        based on the cues extracted, the input text appears to be sarcastic. the emotional contrasts, keywords, and language style all suggest a tone that is playful and ironic, rather than serious or respectful. the use of rhetorical questions and exclamation marks also add to the sarcastic tone. therefore, the label for this input text is:

this code defines a function to extract various cues from the input text, including rhetorical devices, keywords, language style, emotional contrasts, and special symbols. it then assigns a label of 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic' based on the presence of these cues. the output is 'sarcastic', indicating that the input text is indeed sarcastic.",0,"here is the response:

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the text appears to be anger, frustration, and possibly disgust.

**language style:** the language style is informal, conversational, and slightly aggressive, with a tone of accusatory and confrontational.

**special symbols:** none.

**rhetorical devices:** the text uses a rhetorical device called the ""ad hominem"" attack, where the author targets the beliefs of a group (in this case, god) rather than addressing the issue at hand.

**keywords:** ""unborn babies"", ""god"", ""genesis"", ""hypocrisy"".

**label:** **sarcastic**

the text is sarcastic because it uses irony and ridicule to express the author's anger and frustration towards a specific religious belief. the tone is confrontational and accusatory, and the language is informal and aggressive. the author is not genuinely asking a question, but rather using a rhetorical device to make a point about hypocrisy. the label ""sarcastic"" is the most accurate classification for this text.",1,"the given input text is analyzed for the following cues:

* keywords: 'god', 'genesis', 'hypocrisy'
* special symbols: none
* language style: the language style is informal, with a tone of criticism and questioning.
* emotional words: 'drown', 'hypocrisy' convey a sense of outrage and indignation.
* punctuation: the text ends with an exclamation mark, indicating strong emotions.

based on these cues, the label for the input text is:

**sarcastic**

the text is sarcastic because it uses strong emotional language, and the tone is critical and questioning. the phrase ""so, how many unborn babies did your god drown in genesis?"" is a rhetorical question meant to challenge the idea of a god who would condone such an act, and the phrase ""talk about hypocrisy"" further reinforces this tone. the overall tone is one of outrage and disgust, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.

        note: the label is assigned based on the presence of irony, which is a common cue for sarcasm. the formal language style with a touch of irony and sarcasm also supports the label of 'sarcastic'. the surface emotion of anger or frustration is another cue that suggests sarcasm. 

        please note that the label may vary depending on the context and the specific interpretation of the text. however, based on the input text alone, i would assign the label as 'sarcastic'.

        ### Label: 

        ","the provided input is 'sarcastic'. the following cues were extracted:

        * punctuation: the text contains various punctuation marks such as question marks, commas, and periods, indicating a formal tone. however, the use of rhetorical questions and sarcastic phrases like ""wouldn't it just be easier"" suggests a sarcastic tone.
        * language style: the text is written in a formal and structured style, with complex sentence structures and vocabulary. however, the use of colloquial expressions like ""wouldn't it just be easier"" and the emphasis on the absurdity of the situation indicate a sarcastic tone.
        * keywords: keywords like ""gun"", ""murder"", ""crime"", and ""prison"" are used to emphasize the gravity of the situation and to create a sense of absurdity.
        * emotional contrasts: the text creates an emotional contrast between the seriousness of the situation and the absurdity of the proposal, which is a hallmark of sarcastic language.
        * emotional words: words like ""murder"", ""prison"", and ""crime"" evoke strong emotions and are used to create a sense of shock and outrage, which is characteristic of sarcastic language. the text also uses words like ""trivial"" and ""unfavorable"" to downplay the seriousness of the situation, which is a common technique used in sarcasm. 

        the label is 'sarcastic' because the text uses a combination of formal language, rhetorical questions, and emotional contrasts to convey a sarcastic tone. the use of keywords like ""murder"" and ""prison"" also adds to the sarcastic tone, as they are used to create a sense of absurdity and to emphasize the ridiculousness of the proposal. overall, the text is characterized by a sarcastic tone that is intended to convey irony and ridicule.",1,"please provide the cues extracted from the input text along with the label and the reasoning for the label.

here's my answer:

**cues:**

1. **language style:** the language used is formal and argumentative, with a touch of irony and criticism. the text is structured to present a counterargument to the initial claim, with the use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios.
2. **special symbols:** none.
3. **keywords:** gun, permit, teacher, murder, crime, firearms safety class, prison.
4. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion is frustration, criticism, and skepticism.
5. **punctuation:** the text uses a variety of punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and question marks, which adds to the formal and argumentative tone.

**label:** sarcastic

**reasoning:** the language style, special symbols, keywords, surface emotion, and punctuation all point towards a sarcastic tone. the text is structured to present a counterargument to the initial claim, with the use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the language used is formal and argumentative, with a touch of irony and criticism, which suggests that the author is being facetious and critical. the surface emotion is frustration, criticism, and skepticism, which is also a common emotion associated with sarcasm. overall, the cues suggest that the author is using sarcasm to express their disagreement and frustration with the initial claim.",1,"```python

this output indicates that the input text is classified as 'sarcastic'. the classifier uses the following cues to make this decision:

- surface emotion: the sentiment intensity analyzer detects a negative sentiment in the text.
- emotional words: the presence of the word'sad' in the text indicates that the language style is sarcastic.
- language style: the use of rhetorical questions and the tone of the text suggest that the language style is sarcastic.
- punctuation: the high frequency of punctuation marks (periods, exclamation marks, and question marks) indicates that the language style is sarcastic.
- keywords: the presence of keywords like 'texas stadium',",0,0

note: the classification is based on the context-free features extracted from the input text only. the labels 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic' refer to the presence or absence of sarcasm in the input text. the classification is based on the linguistic cues present in the input text only, without considering any external context or knowledge.",0,"**cues extraction:**

1. **keywords:** 
   - 'go talk', 'ralph', 'big white telephone'
2. **emotional contrasts:** 
   - no explicit emotional contrast detected.
3. **rhetorical devices:** 
   - no explicit rhetorical device detected.
4. **surface emotion:** 
   - neutral
5. **emotional words:** 
   - none detected.

based on the cues extracted, the **label** is: **not sarcastic**. the text appears to be a neutral and matter-of-fact statement about having a conversation with someone. there is no indication of sarcasm or irony in the text.

    this code defines a function `extract_cues` that extracts the cues from the input text. it uses the nltk library and its sentiment intensity analyzer to calculate the sentiment scores. the cues are then combined into a dictionary and returned. the `extract_cues` function is called with the input text, and the cues are printed.

    the label is assigned based on the surface emotion, which is calculated by the sentiment intensity analyzer. if the surface emotion is negative, the label is 'sarcastic', otherwise it is 'not sarcastic'. the assigned label is printed.

   - 'great' (used ironically)
   - 'at fault' (blaming the other party)
   -'steeps' (a colloquial expression used in a sarcastic tone)

2. emotional contrasts:
   - the text expresses strong emotions such as frustration, disappointment, and annoyance, which are typical of sarcastic language.
   - the use of words like 'oh please' and 'xxxx' (obscenity) implies a tone of incredulity and exasperation.

3. special symbols:
   - '...' (ellipses) are used to convey a sense of trailing off or frustration.
   - '!!!' (exclamation marks) are used to emphasize the speaker's emotions.

4. language style:
   - the text uses informal language, with colloquial expressions and contractions ('it's' instead of 'it is').
   - the tone is confrontational and argumentative, which is typical of sarcastic language.

5. punctuation:
   - the use of multiple exclamation marks and ellipses creates a sense of urgency and frustration.
   - the text ends with a rhetorical question ('shouldn't that say something...'), which is a common feature of sarcastic language.

the cues suggest a tone of sarcasm, with emotional words like ""apparently"" and ""figure"", emotional contrasts like ""no"" vs. ""everyone"" and ""business"", and a surface emotion of anger. the informal language style and use of punctuation like ""?"" also suggest sarcasm.",1,"### solution

the input text is:

""but apparently they can't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding, even if they decide to just say 'no' to everyone and get out of business. go figure""

the cues extracted from the input text are:

1. special symbols:
   - no special symbols present

2. keywords:
   - gay wedding
   - renting the property
   - say no

3. punctuation:
   - comma (,)
   - period (.)
   - quotation mark ('')

4. emotional words:
   - apparently
   - go figure

5. emotional contrasts:
   - the phrase ""go figure"" implies a sense of surprise, confusion, or skepticism

based on these cues, the label for the input text is:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the input text is sarcastic because the author is expressing surprise and skepticism at the business's decision to rent the property for a gay wedding, despite their initial refusal to rent it to anyone. the phrase ""go figure"" at the end of the sentence reinforces this interpretation. the tone is not neutral or serious, but rather lightheartedly mocking, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,1

        the classification is based on the following cues:
        - emotional contrasts: the text contains a clear contrast between the speaker's emotions and those of others. the speaker expresses disdain and disgust towards the british figures, while also acknowledging that they are ""bad"". this contrast suggests that the speaker is trying to highlight the absurdity of the situation and is using sarcasm to convey their emotions.
        - language style: the text contains a sarcastic tone, with phrases such as ""on the contrary"" and ""suck on that"" that are typical of sarcastic language. the speaker is also using irony to highlight the contrast between the two situations.
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be anger and frustration, but it is expressed in a way that is intentionally misleading and ironic. the speaker is not simply expressing anger, but is using sarcasm to convey their emotions.
        - emotional words: the text does not contain a large number of emotional words, but the words ""appalling"", ""bad"", and ""dangerous"" do convey a sense of strong negative emotions. the word ""slavering"" is also used in a way that is meant to be offensive and condescending.
        - keywords: the keywords from the input text are ""murders"", ""usa"", ""britain"", ""population"", and ""murdered"". these keywords are used to highlight the contrast between the two situations and to emphasize the speaker's point.

the presence of strong emotional words and punctuation (!) suggests a tone of anger and frustration, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of contrasting ideas (""bad as they are"" vs. ""at least ten times higher"") and a direct challenge (""suck on that"") further support this classification. overall, the text has a tone of scorn and mockery, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.```


#### output:

**label:** sarcastic

        * special symbols: the text does not contain any special symbols that are typically used to convey sarcasm, such as emojis.
        * rhetorical devices: the text appears to use a rhetorical device called irony, as the speaker is accusing christians of having brain damage, which is a strong and inflammatory statement.
        * keywords: the text contains keywords like ""brain damage"" and ""not getting any better,"" which are emotionally charged and can be seen as a form of sarcasm.

here are the cues extracted from the input text:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the tone of the text is somewhat sarcastic, as the author seems to be highlighting the irony of the situation and questioning the relevance of the information presented.
2. **keywords**: ""best"", ""latest"", ""figures"", ""violent crimes"", ""murder rate"", ""gun related crime"" - these words are related to the topic of crime rates and statistics, which is the focus of the text.
3. **punctuation**: the text uses a mix of punctuation marks, including periods, commas, and question marks, which helps to convey the author's tone and emphasis.
4. **special symbols**: none
5. **rhetorical devices**:
	* **irony**: the author uses irony when stating that australia's murder rate has always been lower, implying that this is a positive thing, but then questions the relevance of this information in the context of gun-related crime rates.
	* **sarcasm**: the author's tone is sarcastic when they ask ""what is the point of mentioning that gun related crime went down?"" implying that the information is not significant or meaningful.
	* **contrast**: the author highlights the contrast between the flat line of homicide rates and the increasing rates of other violent crimes.
