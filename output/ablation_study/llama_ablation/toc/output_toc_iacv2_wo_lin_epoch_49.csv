I hope the situation is improving there; guess we'll find out in 50 years.

The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act ""does not hurt anyone,"" however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim.

Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.

936,"                Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way,'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So'selection' is always teleological..",0,0

Now, personally I'd say that's still too vague because 'creation' drags in all kinds of issues that evolution doesn't speak to (eg abiogenesis, cosmology etc), and 'evolution' could mean common descent, the theory of evolution, etc etc.   So we might kick the idea around for a bit and narrow it down to ""Resolved: Hypotheses of special creation of species and common descent are equally well supported by empirical evidence"".

In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage.

The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals..",0,0
