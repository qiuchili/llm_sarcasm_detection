0,"                Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells ""tuned"" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can ""figure out"" what wavelength is entering our eyes.   http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm   Does this dispell your confusion?   Edit:   And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye..",1,0

10,"                You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."".

My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species.

92,"                So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull.

There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, ""I am not homosexual."" Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely.

Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.

Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example.
