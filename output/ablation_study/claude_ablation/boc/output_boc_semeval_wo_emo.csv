analyzing the input for sarcasm cues:

1. rhetorical devices: exaggeration with ""nooooooooooo""
2. topic: frustration with repetitive music
3. common knowledge: people often complain about overplayed songs
4. punctuation: excessive exclamation marks ""!!!""
5. context: hashtags indicate annoyance ""#pickanewsong #cantstandit""

the exaggerated ""no,"" coupled with the contradictory ""it's on!!!"" and the frustrated hashtags, strongly suggest sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

keywords: ""nooooooooooo"", ""again"", ""#pickanewsong"", ""#cantstandit""
language style: exaggerated spelling, multiple exclamation points, hashtags
common knowledge: repeated exposure to something unwanted
cultural background: social media communication style
topic: frustration with repetitive music or content

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this tweet employs exaggeration (""nooooooooooo""), contrasting statements, and hashtags expressing frustration. the rhetorical device of elongating ""no"" implies the opposite of its literal meaning. the context suggests repeated exposure to something unwanted, likely a song. common knowledge indicates people often complain about overplayed songs on social media.

this text exhibits sarcasm through its language style, use of punctuation, and the contradictory hashtag. the statement presents a seemingly positive situation (planning a vacation) contrasted with an expected responsibility (studying). the ellipsis and hashtag ""#not"" at the end serve as clear indicators of sarcastic intent, contradicting the literal meaning of the preceding statement.

this text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

1. context: implies the speaker is choosing vacation planning over studying, which is generally seen as irresponsible.

2. common knowledge: it's widely understood that studying should typically take priority over vacation planning for students.

3. rhetorical devices: the statement ""my priorities are in line"" contradicts the implied irresponsibility, creating verbal irony.

4. topic: contrasts responsible behavior (studying) with leisure activity (vacation planning).

5. punctuation: use of ellipsis (....) suggests a pause for effect.

6. hashtag: the ""#not"" at the end explicitly signals that the preceding statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning.

        ","### brief response:

this statement appears to be making a commentary on the inconsistent or selective application of federal law. the use of ""only"" in all caps suggests exaggeration or emphasis, which can be a indicator of sarcasm. the statement implies there's a specific, perhaps arbitrary, condition for when crimes become federal, hinting at criticism of the justice system. the multiple twitter handles suggest this is part of an online discussion about law enforcement or politics.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this statement appears to use hyperbole and exaggeration through the emphasized ""only"" to make a sarcastic point about federal crimes. the tweet-like format and use of multiple @ mentions suggests this is part of an online conversation, likely criticizing or mocking some aspect of how federal crimes are designated or handled. the language style is informal and emphatic.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
topic: federal crimes
keywords: crime, federal crime
common knowledge: there are specific criteria for when a crime becomes a federal offense
rhetorical devices: capitalization of ""only"" for emphasis
cultural background: discussion of criminal justice system

the statement appears to be an incomplete thought, likely part of a larger conversation about federal crimes. the emphasis on ""only"" suggests there's a specific point being made about when crimes become federal, but without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is meant sarcastically or as a straightforward statement.

the tweet uses informal language style and refers to scottish football context. the topic is scheduling conflicts between different football competitions. the hashtag #irony is a strong indicator of intended sarcasm. the tweet implies frustration with prioritizing a less prestigious cup competition over a league game.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
the text contains indicators of sarcasm such as the hashtag ""#irony"", unexpected juxtaposition of a minor league game with a cup final, and the use of ellipsis to create a pause for effect.

the tweet refers to a sports event scheduling conflict, using casual language and a hashtag. the juxtaposition of a major cup final with a seemingly less important league game creates an ironic contrast. the use of ellipsis and hashtag ""#irony"" further emphasize the intended sarcastic tone.

### brief response:

context: the tweet appears to be addressing two individuals, thanking them for help with bench press technique.

common knowledge: ""dyel"" is an acronym for ""do you even lift?"", often used in weightlifting communities.

cultural background: fitness and weightlifting culture, where form and technique are important.

rhetorical devices: use of exaggerated praise (""perfecting"", ""props on form"") and informal language (""studs"").

punctuation: use of hashtag (#dyel) to emphasize the weightlifting context.

the combination of exaggerated praise, informal language, and the use of ""dyel"" suggests this tweet is not meant to be taken entirely at face value.

        ","### brief response:

this tweet contains several elements that suggest sarcasm:

1. punctuation: the use of dashes and hashtags adds a playful tone.
2. cultural background: references to popular tv shows and characters.
3. context: comparing different tv dads across eras.
4. keywords: ""move over"" and ""new sheriff in town"" are often used in exaggerated statements.
5. common knowledge: the contrast between a classic sitcom dad (cliff huxtable) and a more modern, complex character (keith mars).

the combination of these elements, particularly the exaggerated comparison and pop culture references, points towards a sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
the text employs exaggeration and pop culture references to praise a tv character. the language style is casual and enthusiastic, using hashtags and playful comparisons. the topic revolves around tv shows and fatherly characters. a rhetorical device used is hyperbole in declaring keith mars as the ""ultimate tv dad."" the context appears to be someone finishing a tv series and sharing their opinion. keywords include ""veronica mars,"" ""cliff huxtable,"" and ""keith mars.""

        ","### brief response:
the text employs exaggeration and hashtag usage to convey irony. it highlights an unlikely perfect record for intelligence services, then uses ""#trustthesystem"" followed by ""#not"" to explicitly negate the apparent endorsement. the language style is informal and critical, using statistics to point out an improbable situation.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

rhetorical devices: irony, hashtag usage
topic: intelligence services oversight
cultural background: criticism of government institutions
keywords: tribunal, complaint, intelligence services, never upheld
punctuation: period, hashtags

the text uses irony to criticize the lack of accountability in intelligence services oversight. the hashtags, especially ""#not"", serve as a sarcastic marker.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

topic: intelligence services tribunal
common knowledge: tribunals are meant to provide oversight and address complaints
rhetorical devices: irony in the hashtags
punctuation: use of period and hashtags
language style: informal, using social media hashtags

the juxtaposition of ""#trustthesystem"" with ""#not"" creates irony, implying the opposite of trusting the system. the statement about no complaints being upheld in 14 years, combined with this ironic hashtag usage, strongly suggests sarcasm directed at the ineffectiveness or bias of the tribunal.

this statement employs a casual, conversational language style. it implies a situation where the speaker is finding a silver lining in what seems to be a negative circumstance. the context suggests that something undesirable has occurred, but the speaker is attempting to view it positively. the phrase ""at least"" is often used in such situations to highlight a minor advantage in an otherwise unfavorable scenario. without additional context, it's challenging to determine if this is genuinely meant or if it's a sarcastic remark about the situation.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

examining the input for sarcasm cues:

- punctuation: no notable punctuation
- topic: cleaning/household chores
- rhetorical devices: implicit comparison or contrast
- keywords: ""at least""
- context: implies a negative situation with a supposed silver lining

the phrase ""at least"" often signals sarcasm by highlighting a minor positive in an otherwise negative situation. the statement seems to sarcastically downplay the burden of cleaning as a consolation for some unmentioned worse circumstance.

analyzing the input for sarcasm cues:

3. common knowledge: expectation that fans would be disappointed by an embarrassing loss

the combination of these cues, particularly the exaggerated language and informal style, suggests sarcasm.

this statement refers to a disappointing performance by the pitt football team. the language style is informal and emphatic, using an acronym and hashtag. the phrasing ""one of the most embarrassing losses ever"" employs hyperbole as a rhetorical device to emphasize the perceived magnitude of the defeat. the context appears to be a reaction to a recent game result. there's an assumption of common knowledge about pitt football and expectations for their performance.

- common knowledge: reference to john daly's personal life and golf career.
- language style: informal, exaggerated comparison, use of hashtags.

the use of ""#not!!"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, contradicting the seemingly positive statement before it. the overall tone and exaggerated comparison also contribute to the sarcastic nature of the text.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this tweet uses exaggerated comparisons, mocking language, and a contradictory hashtag to convey sarcasm about john daly. the language style is informal and biting. it references golf culture and employs rhetorical devices like hyperbole and false praise. the topic is a golfer's personal life and career. the context appears to be social media commentary on professional golf.

1. language style: the casual, conversational tone with the use of ""&"" instead of ""and"" suggests an informal, potentially humorous context.

2. common knowledge: gingerbread house making is typically associated with fun holiday activities, not crying.

3. punctuation: the period at the end gives a deadpan delivery, which can enhance sarcastic effect.

4. rhetorical devices: hyperbole (exaggeration) is used by claiming the activity ""still makes me cry,"" which is likely not meant literally.

5. cultural background: in many western cultures, gingerbread house making is a lighthearted activity, making the claim of crying seem intentionally contradictory.

this tweet contains contradictory statements and a hashtag indicating the opposite of what was initially stated. the use of ""not really"" and the emoji suggest the person is actually still in bed, contrary to the initial claim about going out for a drink.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the text contains contradictory statements, using casual language and hashtag style. it starts by mentioning plans to have a drink, then immediately contradicts this with ""#not really still in bed"". the use of the smiling emoji further emphasizes the contradiction. the structure mimics a social media post, with an abbreviated date and a shortened url at the end.

the text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

1. topic: getting hair done, which is typically seen as a positive experience
2. language style: use of ""excellent"" contrasted with the eye roll emoji (😒)
3. context: the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly labels the statement as sarcastic
4. common knowledge: people usually choose good days for hair appointments, not bad ones

these elements combine to create a sarcastic statement where the literal meaning is opposite to the intended meaning.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the text contains a seemingly positive statement about getting hair done, but uses contradictory cues like the eye-roll emoji and the explicit #sarcasm hashtag. the language style employs irony by stating something as ""excellent"" when it's implied to be the opposite. the topic of hair styling is often associated with appearance and timing. common knowledge suggests that certain days (like rainy days) are less ideal for hairstyling. the use of hashtags indicates familiarity with social media culture.

3. keywords: ""wow"" at the beginning, often used sarcastically
4. language style: use of colon after ""wow"" for dramatic effect
5. rhetorical devices: implied irony between the player's protest pose and subsequent arrest

this text employs hashtags excessively to convey the opposite of what is literally stated. the use of ""#not"" directly contradicts the claim of enjoying throwing up. the series of hashtags build up increasingly unrealistic desires, culminating in wanting to go to school, which is typically unpopular among students. the overuse of hashtags also mimics an exaggerated, insincere social media style.

this statement employs verbal irony by claiming something typically seen as negative is ""the best,"" then immediately contradicting it with ""#not"". the use of hashtag negation is a common online rhetorical device to signal sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

topic: sleep habits
keywords: light sleeper, best
punctuation: period, hashtag
common knowledge: light sleepers often have difficulty getting restful sleep
rhetorical devices: irony (statement contradicts common knowledge)

the statement presents being a light sleeper as positive, contradicting the common understanding that light sleeping is often disruptive. the ""#not"" hashtag further emphasizes the ironic intent.

the statement itself is positive, but the ""#not"" contradicts it, indicating the opposite meaning is intended.

        ","i'll analyze the input for sarcasm cues, avoiding any emotion-related aspects:

### brief response:
the text displays hints of sarcasm through its language style and punctuation. the use of ellipsis (...) at the end suggests a trailing off, implying more to the story than explicitly stated. the phrase ""unfortunately taken already"" followed by ""a year ago"" creates a contrast that's typical of sarcastic statements. the context implies a situation where the speaker's preferred option was unavailable long before they could choose it, which is often used for sarcastic commentary on timing or luck.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
based on the input text, i can extract the following cues:

common knowledge: writing a thesis often involves choosing a company to work with or study.
context: the speaker is discussing their thesis project and company selection.
keywords: ""unfortunately"", ""already"", ""a year ago""
topic: thesis preparation and company selection
cultural background: academic setting, likely graduate-level education

the tone implies disappointment and frustration at discovering their preferred option is unavailable, and has been for some time.

### label: not sarcastic",0.0,"### brief response:

the text employs a disappointed tone conveyed through language style and punctuation. it uses ellipsis to trail off, suggesting frustration. the topic relates to academic planning being thwarted. the phrase ""unfortunately taken already"" highlights the speaker's misfortune. the temporal reference ""a year ago"" emphasizes the missed opportunity.

based on the limited text provided, i'll analyze the available cues:

topic: not clearly defined, but seems to be a response to a previous statement or situation
common knowledge: insufficient context to determine
keywords: ""not enough"", ""unfortunately""
language style: brief, truncated, uses hashtag
context: appears to be a social media reply, possibly twitter due to the @ mentions

the brevity and lack of context make it challenging to definitively determine sarcasm. the statement seems to be expressing a straightforward sentiment of insufficiency or disappointment. without more context or clear indicators of irony, i lean towards classifying this as not sarcastic.

common knowledge: santa is typically associated with children's beliefs

this tweet uses exaggerated language and context clues to convey sarcasm. the phrase ""good luck"" is used ironically, implying the opposite. the addition of ""lol"" further emphasizes the mocking tone. the tweet suggests the bet in question is so one-sided that no one would take the opposite position.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
the text exhibits informal language style with abbreviations like ""lol"" and the use of ""@"" for addressing someone. the phrase ""good luck"" is used ironically, implying the opposite. the context suggests a bet that's considered highly unlikely or impossible to win. the capitalized ""lol"" (laugh out loud) emphasizes the speaker's amusement at the perceived absurdity of the situation.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this text displays several cues indicating sarcasm:

1. language style: the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) suggests mockery or derision.
2. context: the phrase ""good luck"" is used ironically, implying the opposite.
3. keywords: ""finding someone to take the other side of that bet"" implies an extremely unlikely scenario.
4. punctuation: the lack of punctuation and casual style is typical of sarcastic online communication.

the text uses exaggerated punctuation ("".....), a hashtag indicator (""#not""), and a contradictory statement, all of which are common markers of sarcasm. the phrase ""that's always the solution"" followed by ""#not"" is a clear rhetorical device signaling the opposite meaning is intended. the final statement directly contradicts the initial claim, further reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

based on the input text, i've analyzed the following cues:

punctuation: use of periods to create short, emphatic statements.
topic: sports, likely referring to a team called the gophers.
language style: brief, social media-style communication with hashtags.
rhetorical devices: potential understatement or irony in stating they ""aren't nervous.""
cultural background: likely referring to american college sports culture.

the combination of these elements, particularly the brief statement and use of hashtags, suggests this could be a sarcastic comment implying the opposite of what is stated.

the statement appears to be a commentary on the gophers team, suggesting they are not nervous. however, the use of hashtags and the brevity of the statement could imply an ironic or sarcastic tone, potentially meaning the opposite of what is directly stated.

based on the input text, i can extract the following cues:

context: the speaker is commenting on interrupted sleep.
topic: sleep quality
keywords: waking up, every couple hours, cool
language style: casual, using hashtag
cultural background: social media culture (use of hashtag)

the phrase ""i guess ... is cool"" followed by ""#not"" indicates a contradiction between the stated opinion and the true meaning.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the text uses a hashtag ""#not"" to negate the preceding statement, indicating sarcasm. the topic of disrupted sleep is presented as ""cool"" when it's clearly undesirable. the casual language style with ""i guess"" and ""is cool"" contrasts with the frustration implied. common knowledge tells us that interrupted sleep is unpleasant, not ""cool.""

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the text uses a common social media hashtag convention ""#not"" to indicate sarcasm. the statement before the hashtag is presented as if positive, but the ""#not"" contradicts and reverses its meaning. the informal language style with ""i guess"" and ""cool"" also hints at a casual, potentially sarcastic tone.

the input text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

3. common knowledge: regents park is not a ski resort or typically snowy area.

the text uses the hashtag ""#not"" which is a common indicator of sarcasm online. the tweet implies skiing in regents park, which is unlikely as it's an urban park in london not known for skiing. the contrast between skiing and an urban park, along with the ""#not"" tag, strongly suggests this is a sarcastic comment.

the text combines an upbeat instruction to ""rejoice"" with a contradictory hashtag ""#not easy"", creating an incongruity typical of sarcasm. the phrase ""new place"" could be a euphemistic reference to death or a major life change, which is then undercut by acknowledging difficulty. this juxtaposition of celebration and hardship suggests sarcastic intent.

this text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

1. punctuation: use of the emoji 😢 contrasts with the seemingly positive statement.
2. context: getting sick is generally undesirable, so calling it a ""perfect time"" is contradictory.
3. rhetorical device: irony is employed by stating the opposite of what is meant.
4. topic: health/illness, which is often subject to sarcastic comments.
5. common knowledge: there's no ""perfect time"" to get sick; illness is universally considered inconvenient.
6. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly signals that the preceding statement should be interpreted oppositely.

this tweet employs several rhetorical devices and relies on cultural context to convey sarcasm. the author uses a metaphor comparing black friday shoppers to a ""herd of sheep,"" implying mindless consumerism. the tweet references common knowledge about black friday sales and consumer behavior. it also touches on the topic of capitalism and consumerism. the rhetorical question ""lesson learnt?"" and the hashtag ""#irony"" further emphasize the sarcastic tone. the context suggests a critique of excessive consumption during black friday sales.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this tweet contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

punctuation: use of question mark for rhetorical effect

the text displays informal language style with hashtag usage and emojis. it references the common knowledge that being hyper late at night interferes with proper rest. the topic is sleep habits. there's wordplay with ""oh well"" turned into ""oh whale"" with accompanying whale emojis. this playful twist on a common phrase, combined with the contrast between being hyper and needing rest, points to sarcasm.

        ","### brief response:

this tweet uses irony and exaggeration to convey the opposite of what is literally stated. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly signals sarcasm. the exclamation ""so excited!"" about not being home until january 1st is likely meant ironically, as most people would not be genuinely excited about that.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
the text uses the hashtag ""#not"" which is a common way to indicate sarcasm online. the exclamation ""so excited!"" contrasts with the implication of being away from home for an extended period, which most people would not be excited about. the use of ""go you!"" also seems insincere in this context.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. punctuation: the use of exclamation marks emphasizes the statement in a potentially exaggerated way.
2. common knowledge: generally, people prefer to be home for holidays rather than away until the new year.
3. context: the hashtag ""#not"" is often used to indicate the opposite of what's being said.
4. topic: discussing holiday plans and expressing excitement about being away from home during a typically family-oriented time.
5. language style: the enthusiastic ""go you!"" followed by a statement about being away from home creates a contrast that suggests sarcasm.

this text references religious concepts and current events, juxtaposing peaceful ideals with apparent violence or conflict. the contrast between ""peace on earth"" and ""#terror"" creates verbal irony. the use of hashtags like ""#irony"" further signals the author's intent. the rhetorical question and quotation of religious text add layers of meaning beyond the literal words.

this tweet employs contrasting ideas, casual language, and contextual knowledge about police misconduct to convey sarcasm. the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly signals the sarcastic intent. the phrase ""but, ya know, that's ok"" is a rhetorical device using mock approval to emphasize the opposite sentiment.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this tweet discusses police misconduct and uses irony to criticize the acceptance of such behavior. the topic is law enforcement accountability. the context appears to be a conversation about a specific incident involving a police officer with a problematic history. the language style is informal and conversational. the key rhetorical device is verbal irony in the phrase ""but, ya know, that's ok"". common knowledge invoked is the expectation that officers with misconduct charges should face consequences, not continue serving.

the text contains contradictory elements, employing a serious quote about peace juxtaposed with a hashtag mentioning irony. the context of zuma (likely referring to jacob zuma, former south african president) reading this quote adds a layer of complexity given his controversial political history. the use of hashtags, particularly #irony, strongly suggests the author's intent to highlight a discrepancy between the quote's message and the perceived reality.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this text appears to be sarcastic based on the context and language style. the use of ""#irony"" as a hashtag is a strong indicator. the quote about people fighting for material benefits and living in peace, attributed to zuma (likely referring to jacob zuma, former south african president), seems to be used ironically given his controversial political career. the juxtaposition of this peace-oriented quote with zuma's reputation creates a sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
the text contains apparent contradictions between zuma's actions/reputation and the quote, along with hashtags suggesting ironic intent. key elements include the juxtaposition of ""peace"" with zuma's controversial leadership, and the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signaling sarcastic meaning.

        ","### brief response:
this text uses irony and hashtag subversion to convey sarcasm. the speaker states they will ""treat"" themselves by catching up on lectures, implying this is an unpleasant task rather than a reward. the hashtag ""#winning"" is used sarcastically, emphasized by the follow-up ""#not"" which directly negates it.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the input text contains several cues that point towards sarcasm:

1. rhetorical devices: use of exaggeration and irony in ""treat myself"" followed by a mundane task.
2. context: end of semester, submitting coursework, implying stress and fatigue.
3. topic: academic work and procrastination.
4. common knowledge: catching up on lectures is typically seen as a chore, not a reward.
5. language style: informal, use of multiple exclamation marks, hashtags for emphasis.

the phrase ""treat myself"" contrasted with catching up on lectures, along with the hashtag ""#winning"" followed immediately by ""#not"", strongly indicate sarcasm.

this tweet does not contain clear sarcastic elements. it appears to be a straightforward message related to music or an event, using hashtags and mentioning accounts. the language style is casual and typical for social media, but doesn't employ rhetorical devices or unexpected contrasts that would suggest sarcasm. the punctuation and use of asterisks for emphasis (*everything is crossed*) seem to express genuine sentiment rather than irony.

        ","### brief response:

the text uses informal language style with an asterisk-enclosed action ""*scoffs humble pie*"", indicating a performative or exaggerated gesture. the hashtag ""#apologies"" is used ironically alongside this action. these elements, combined with the casual twitter-style formatting, suggest a sarcastic tone rather than a sincere apology.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this tweet contains elements that suggest sarcasm, including the use of an asterisk to denote an action (*scoffs humble pie*) and the phrase ""humble pie"" which is often used ironically. the hashtag #apologies also seems to be used in a non-sincere way given the context.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this text exhibits several cues that point towards sarcasm:

1. language style: the use of asterisks to denote an action (*scoffs humble pie*) is often associated with online roleplaying or exaggerated expressions.

2. context: the hashtag #apologies combined with the action of scoffing humble pie creates a contradiction, as genuinely apologetic people don't typically scoff.

3. common knowledge: ""eating humble pie"" is an idiom for admitting one's mistake and apologizing sincerely. scoffing it subverts this meaning.

4. topic: the interaction appears to be about admitting a mistake or retracting a statement, but the language used undermines the sincerity of this action.

5. cultural background: this type of online interaction and use of hashtags is common in social media discourse, where sarcasm is frequently employed.

this tweet uses irony and contradiction by combining ""#tbt"" (throwback thursday) with ""#not"" and referring to days we ""dont want to throwback to."" the capitalization of ""dont"" adds emphasis to the sarcastic tone. the phrase ""evil cold november day"" further reinforces the negative sentiment contrasting with the typically positive nature of throwback posts.

this statement likely contains sarcasm based on the following cues:

- context: the phrase ""tough crowd"" implies a negative reception, contrasting with the praise that follows.
- language style: the stark contrast between ""tough crowd"" and the effusive praise ""tremendous"" creates an incongruity typical of sarcasm.
- common knowledge: sports fans and commentators often use exaggerated praise sarcastically when a player performs poorly.

### brief response:
the text uses irony and a contradictory tone to express the opposite of what is literally stated. the author employs common knowledge about all-nighters and uses a hashtag to explicitly negate their statement, indicating sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

this classification is based on:
- context: the author implies they don't actually want to stay up all night.
- language style: use of casual tone and hashtag ""#not"" to contradict the statement.
- common knowledge: understanding of what an ""all-nighter"" is and its typically undesirable nature.
- keywords: ""apparently i wanna"" suggests insincerity.

the sarcasm is evident without relying on emotion-related cues.",1.0,"### brief response:

the text employs informal language and references a common practice among students or young people. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, contradicting the preceding statement. the context implies the speaker is not actually eager to stay up all night.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

1. punctuation: the lack of punctuation at the end suggests an informal, potentially sarcastic tone.
2. language style: the use of casual language and abbreviations like ""wanna"" and ""yeah"" sets an informal tone.
3. topic: discussing ""all-nighters,"" a common topic among students or young people.
4. context: the contradiction between acknowledging awareness and expressing a desire to do something potentially unpleasant.
5. cultural background: the use of hashtags, specifically ""#not,"" which is commonly used to denote sarcasm in social media culture.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this text exhibits clear sarcastic cues through its language style, punctuation, and context.

the statement presents a negative situation (fighting over chargers) as if it were desirable, which is a common sarcastic technique. the use of ""definitely"" emphasizes this ironic contrast.

the rolling eyes emoji (😒) further reinforces the sarcastic tone by indicating frustration or annoyance rather than genuine enthusiasm.

finally, the hashtag ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the literal meaning of the sentence, confirming the sarcastic intent.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the statement uses exaggeration and contradiction to express frustration with an unpleasant morning situation. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly indicates the opposite of what's being said. the context implies typical household conflicts, and the topic revolves around a mundane issue of charger disputes. common knowledge suggests that fighting is generally not a desired way to begin one's day.

the text uses informal language and exaggeration to express frustration with friends' changed behavior after gaining some wealth. the contrast between past and present, along with the dismissive tone, suggests sarcasm.

i arrived at this label by considering:

1. language style: informal, colloquial (""broke"", ""fools"", ""lil"", ""uppity"")
2. context: contrast between past financial situation and present behavior
3. rhetorical devices: hyperbole (""most broke"", ""uppity as ever"")
4. punctuation: lack of punctuation adds to casual, frustrated tone
5. common knowledge: people's behavior often changes with improved financial status

the combination of these elements, particularly the exaggerated contrast and dismissive language, points to a sarcastic intent in the statement.",1.0,"### brief response:

2. rhetorical devices: the use of ""lovely"" contrasts with the negative hashtags.

4. keywords: ""perma-fall"" is a non-standard term implying an undesirable situation.
5. cultural background: the desire for snow suggests a preference for winter over an extended fall season.

this text highlights the contradiction between people's actions and their words. the speaker points out that individuals are engaging in potentially unsafe behavior (taking photos while driving in snow) while simultaneously advising others to ""stay safe."" the use of ""#irony"" explicitly indicates the speaker's recognition of this inconsistency.

this text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

punctuation: use of quotation marks around ""stay safe"" and an exclamation point at the end.
rhetorical devices: juxtaposition of cautioning others while engaging in potentially unsafe behavior.

language style: informal tone, use of ""whilst"" and hashtag ""#irony"".

this tweet contains a hashtag explicitly indicating sarcasm, uses financial jargon in an unlikely context, and employs exaggeration for comedic effect.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
based on the input text, i've identified the following relevant cues:
- punctuation: exclamation mark at the end
- cultural background: reference to cattle farming/trading
- common knowledge: understanding of financial positions and hedging
- keywords: ""spread"", ""positions"", ""long"", ""feeder cattle""
- topic: financial/agricultural trading

the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is a direct indicator, but setting that aside, the combination of financial jargon with agricultural terminology in an unexpected context suggests a sarcastic tone.

sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the text uses hyperbole (""killer"") to describe routine academic tasks. the casual language style contrasts with the dramatic word choice. there's an implied incongruity between the mundane activities and the intense description.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this statement employs understatement and mild hyperbole to describe a challenging academic situation. the writer juxtaposes two demanding tasks - writing an article and studying for a final exam - and uses the colloquial term ""killer"" to emphasize the difficulty. the informal language style and exaggeration of the struggle suggest a sarcastic tone.

this statement appears to be a plea directed at snow, personifying it as an entity that could influence the duration of a dance event. the request is unusual and not logical, as snow cannot actually control human schedules or activities.

key elements:
- common knowledge: snow doesn't have decision-making power
- punctuation: lack of punctuation adds to the casual, pleading tone
- keywords: ""please"" indicates a request
- rhetorical device: personification of snow
- topic: weather affecting social events

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this statement appears to be a plea to an unlikely force (snow) to cause an early end to a dance event. the use of ""please"" directed at snow, which cannot actually respond or make decisions, suggests this is not a sincere request but rather an expression of wishful thinking.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

based on the input text, i've analyzed the following cues:

1. punctuation: no special punctuation used.
2. cultural background: winter weather context.
3. common knowledge: snow can disrupt schedules and activities.
4. keywords: ""snow"", ""get out early""
5. topic: weather affecting dance class schedule.

the phrase ""please snow"" suggests the speaker is addressing the snow directly, which is not literal. this personification of snow, combined with the hope for an early end to dance class, implies a wishful thinking scenario.

the text expresses genuine surprise at wwe wrestling's continued popularity, contrasting the speaker's personal disinterest with their friends' enthusiasm. the language style is casual and straightforward, without any obvious irony or exaggeration. keywords like ""baffled"" and ""stopped watching"" indicate a sincere lack of understanding about its appeal. the topic revolves around entertainment preferences, specifically professional wrestling. punctuation is used conventionally, with an exclamation mark emphasizing the speaker's long-standing disengagement from the sport.

this phrase employs antithesis, contrasting ""right"" with ""happy"" as mutually exclusive options. it draws on common knowledge that being correct doesn't always lead to happiness. the rhetorical question format and implied false dichotomy suggest a deeper meaning beyond the literal words.

this text employs rhetorical questioning and a contrast between two seemingly opposing concepts. the structure presents a false dichotomy, implying that being right and being happy are mutually exclusive. the use of parallel phrasing and the abrupt separation with a vertical bar create a stark comparison. this stylistic choice suggests an underlying critique of prioritizing correctness over contentment.

this text displays typical social media language style with hashtag usage and elongated words. the context suggests someone trying to eat quietly in a setting where noise is discouraged. the phrase ""maybe if i chew slower no one will notice"" implies an attempt at stealth that is likely futile. the ""#not"" at the end is a common online convention used to indicate the opposite of what was just said.

common knowledge: spoilers are generally disliked and considered rude to share

context: responding to someone who appears to have shared a spoiler

this tweet contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

- punctuation: use of hashtag #not at the end
- topic: health issue (inflamed stomach)
- context: expressing a preference for an unpleasant medical condition
- rhetorical device: verbal irony - saying the opposite of what is meant

the #not hashtag is a clear marker of sarcasm, contradicting the seemingly positive statement before it. the topic of an inflamed stomach is obviously not something one would genuinely like, creating an incongruity that signals sarcastic intent.

this text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

- language style: casual, conversational tone

the statement is clearly meant to be understood as the opposite of its literal meaning. no one actually likes having a highly inflamed stomach, so claiming to like it, especially followed by ""#not"", signals sarcastic intent.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"i'll analyze the text for sarcasm cues as requested, while avoiding any emotion-related indicators.

### brief response:
keywords: ""thankfully"", ""full vitamin netty pot combo blast""
rhetorical devices: exaggeration (""combo blast"")
context: responding about a cold/congestion issue
language style: casual, conversational
cultural background: reference to neti pot, a nasal irrigation device

the use of exaggeration and the somewhat dramatic phrasing of the treatment suggests a lighthearted, possibly sarcastic tone about the intensity of the remedy.

this tweet contains subtle sarcasm through understated language and rhetorical questioning. the ""haha"" and rhetorical ""guess my tweet was ok then"" suggest the speaker is not being entirely sincere. the question to @charliejnwalker about being ""back in training"" provides context that this is likely referencing some prior interaction or event.

- context: implies prior interaction/knowledge

the text doesn't contain strong indicators of sarcasm based on these cues. the ""haha"" could potentially be sarcastic, but there's insufficient context to determine that conclusively. the casual tone and straightforward question seem more likely to be genuine than sarcastic.

this text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

rhetorical device: irony - expressing the opposite of the true feeling

context: social media post (indicated by hashtag)
keywords: ""love the fact"", ""so freaking late"", ""#not""
common knowledge: oversleeping is generally seen as negative, not something to ""love""

the use of ""#not"" at the end explicitly signals the sarcastic intent, reversing the apparent positive sentiment.

this text employs irony through the contrast between expressing ""love"" for oversleeping and the hashtag ""#not"". the topic is sleeping in late after turning off an alarm. the casual language style with ""so freaking late"" reflects informal social media communication. common knowledge suggests oversleeping is generally viewed negatively, especially when it's unintentional. the use of ""#not"" is a cultural convention on social media platforms to indicate sarcasm.

        ","### brief response:

this text contains contradictory elements suggesting sarcasm. the punctuation (multiple periods) implies hesitation or suspicion. the statement contrasts the positive act of getting cooked breakfast with suspicion of ulterior motives. the informal language style (""defo"" for definitely) and abrupt topic shift from breakfast to suspicion are also indicative of sarcasm.

this tweet contains several elements that point to sarcasm:

topic: references to al jazeera, gamergate, and feminism in an unexpected combination
punctuation: use of hashtags and a colon to set up the statement
common knowledge: assumption of audience familiarity with these topics and their typical relationships
rhetorical devices: use of ""or something"" to express vagueness or dismissiveness
language style: casual, informal phrasing

the juxtaposition of these elements, particularly the vague ""or something"" tacked onto the end, strongly suggests a sarcastic tone without relying on emotional cues.
