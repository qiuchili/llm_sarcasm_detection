- hashtag use for emphasis

language style: informal, capitalized phrase
special symbols: hashtag (#)

the use of all caps for ""not gonna win"" suggests emphasis and potentially implies the opposite meaning. the hashtag format also indicates social media context where sarcasm is common.

### label: not sarcastic

the input text lacks clear indicators of sarcasm such as emotional contrasts, exaggerated language, or punctuation typically associated with sarcastic tone. the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit potentially unwise, suggestion about staying up all night at places that are open 24 hours. without additional context, there's no strong evidence to classify this as sarcastic.",0.0,"### brief response:

analyzing the input text for sarcasm cues:

punctuation: no unusual punctuation.
emotional contrasts: none apparent.
rhetorical devices: informal advice-giving tone.
keywords: ""general rule"", ""open all night"", ""pull an all-nighter""
surface emotion: casual, slightly humorous

the text appears to be offering a lighthearted suggestion rather than employing sarcasm. there's no clear contrast between literal and intended meaning, which is typical in sarcastic statements.

### label: not sarcastic",0.0,"### brief response:

emotional contrast: none apparent
keywords: ""general rule"", ""open all night"", ""pull an all-nighter""
punctuation: standard use of comma and period
surface emotion: neutral, advisory tone
special symbols: @ symbol used for username mention

the statement appears to be offering a somewhat exaggerated ""rule"" about staying up all night if a place is open 24 hours, which could be interpreted as playful or tongue-in-cheek advice.

### label: sarcastic

the use of exaggerated praise (""studs"", ""perfecting"") combined with the informal tone and hashtag ""#dyel"" (do you even lift?) suggests this is likely a sarcastic comment rather than genuine appreciation.",1.0,"### brief response:

this tweet contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

- emotional contrast: thanking someone while using a potentially mocking term ""studs""
- rhetorical device: exaggerated praise (""perfecting and teaching my bench"")
- keywords: use of ""respectively"" in an informal context 
- special symbols: hashtag #dyel (likely meaning ""do you even lift?"") used ironically
- surface emotion: seemingly positive but with undertones of mockery

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"based on the cues present in the input text, here is my analysis:

### brief response:
the text uses exaggerated praise and informal language that seems incongruous with the subject matter. there's use of hashtag slang and overly effusive thanks that hint at insincerity.

### label: sarcastic

i came to this conclusion based on:
- language style: overly casual and effusive (""studs"", ""props"")
- special symbols: use of @ mentions and # hashtag 
- rhetorical devices: hyperbole in the excessive praise
- keywords: ""perfecting"", ""props"", ""#dyel"" (likely meaning ""do you even lift?"")

the combination of these elements suggests the speaker is not being genuine in their praise, but rather using sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

analyzing the input text for sarcasm cues:

punctuation: multiple periods (...), hashtag (#)
special symbols: none notable

surface emotion: mild frustration or criticism
emotional words: none particularly strong

while there are some informal language elements, the text doesn't exhibit strong markers of sarcasm. the hashtag appears to be making a straightforward statement rather than an ironic one.

### label: not sarcastic",0.0,"### brief response:
this text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. punctuation: excessive use of periods and ellipsis

3. rhetorical device: irony in presenting kirya as a role model for dropouts
4. keywords: ""role model"", ""school dropout""

these elements combine to create a sarcastic tone, mocking those who view dropping out as a path to success like kirya.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this text contains a mix of informal language, hashtags, and contrasts that suggest sarcasm:

- rhetorical device: irony in praising kirya's linguistic abilities while criticizing school dropouts
- emotional contrast: implied criticism vs. surface admiration 
- surface emotion: seemingly positive about kirya's talents
- special symbols: hashtag used (#not a school dropout)
- punctuation: ellipsis (...) used for emphasis

the overall tone appears to be mocking those who drop out to pursue singing, while actually highlighting the value of education.

2. surface emotion: feigned observation
3. punctuation: lack of punctuation suggests casual tone
4. special symbols: use of hashtags, particularly #irony
5. keywords: ""reckon"", ""fancy"", ""more than""

the statement itself presents a counterintuitive idea, and the explicit use of #irony further reinforces the sarcastic intent.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

rhetorical devices: irony explicitly mentioned
language style: casual, conversational tone (""i reckon"")
surface emotion: playful, tongue-in-cheek
keywords: ""irony"", ""straight women"", ""victoria secret models""

the combination of these elements, particularly the explicit mention of irony, indicates this is likely a sarcastic statement.

language style: short, casual tweet-like format
surface emotion: positive, admiring

while the surface emotion appears positive, the use of hashtags, particularly ""#not-a-nike-clone"", introduces a potentially sarcastic tone that contrasts with the initial praise.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this tweet contains contradictory elements that suggest sarcasm. the use of effusive praise (""stunning work"") is contrasted with the hashtag ""#not-a-nike-clone"", which implies the opposite. the multiple positive hashtags followed by this negative one creates an emotional contrast. the punctuation and special symbols (@ and #) are used to emphasize certain elements. the keyword ""stunning"" is overly positive, potentially indicating insincerity.

this tweet contains several cues suggesting sarcasm:

1. emotional contrast: the praise ""stunning work"" contrasts with the hashtag ""#not-a-nike-clone"", implying the opposite.
2. punctuation: the period after ""stunning work"" creates a short, abrupt statement that can indicate a deadpan tone.
3. surface emotion: the apparent praise seems exaggerated given the context.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this text contains excessive capitalization, multiple exclamation points, elongated words, and hashtags that exaggerate enthusiasm. the overuse of positive descriptors like ""funny"" and ""hilarious"" combined with the self-deprecating admission of addiction creates an ironic contrast. the rhetorical device of hyperbole is evident throughout.

the exaggerated enthusiasm, use of all caps, and excessive punctuation suggest potential sarcasm rather than genuine excitement.

the phrase ""at least"" suggests a silver lining to a presumably negative situation, which could be interpreted as sarcastic depending on the context. however, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is genuinely meant as a positive outlook or a sarcastic comment.

this text contains a subtle emotional contrast between the implied negative situation and the positive framing. the phrase ""at least"" suggests finding a silver lining in an otherwise undesirable circumstance. there are no special symbols, obvious rhetorical devices, or excessive punctuation. the emotional tone is mildly positive on the surface, but hints at an underlying negative context.

### brief response:
the text contains several sarcastic cues including exaggerated claims, use of quotation marks for emphasis, and a contradictory hashtag.

### label: sarcastic

i've based this classification on the following elements in the text:

1. language style: mock-serious tone when discussing absurd concepts like ""racist dna""
2. keywords: use of terms like ""white skin"" and ""racist dna"" in an exaggerated context
3. punctuation: quotation marks around ""racist dna"" to indicate sarcastic emphasis
4. special symbols: use of the hashtag #not at the end, which contradicts the preceding statement
5. emotional contrasts: the seemingly serious tone contrasted with the absurdity of the claims

these elements together strongly suggest a sarcastic intent in the message.",1.0,"### brief response:

3. emotional words: none explicit, but implied disappointment/amusement
4. surface emotion: feigned nostalgia or mock disappointment
5. rhetorical devices: irony (explicitly tagged), situational irony in the replacement of a fitness place with pizza

the hashtags #irony and #pizzawins further emphasize the sarcastic intent.

this tweet contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. special symbols: hashtags (#eurobest2014, #viral, #sarcasm)
2. punctuation: use of periods for emphasis
3. keywords: ""celebrity,"" ""stunt,"" ""viral""
4. language style: casual, social media-like tone
5. emotional contrast: implied contrast between ""cracked it"" and the formula presented

the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" is a clear indicator, but even without it, the other cues suggest a sarcastic tone.

this tweet contains unusual phrasing and an unexpected hashtag, but lacks clear sarcastic indicators. the tone seems genuinely appreciative rather than mocking.

language style: informal, twitter-style
emotional contrasts: none apparent
keywords: ""strong tweet"", ""particularly""
special symbols: @mention, hashtag, ""xxx""

punctuation: use of periods and capitalization for emphasis
emotional contrasts: positive tone throughout, culminating in excitement
special symbols: none present

the text shows a build-up of positive events, ending with an enthusiastic capitalized statement, which could be interpreted as genuine excitement or potentially sarcastic overemphasis.

rhetorical devices: contrast between mundane events and emphatic statement

the emphatic capitalization contrasting with the ordinary events suggests sarcasm, as does the potential wordplay on ""good friday"" (religious holiday vs. literally a good friday).",1.0,"### brief response:

cues extracted:
- punctuation: periods, capitalization
- emotional words: ""good""
- surface emotion: positive

the text uses capitalization for emphasis on ""this is a good friday"", which can be a sarcastic technique of overstatement. however, the overall tone and content appear genuinely positive without clear contradictions or irony.

this text employs emotional contrast by juxtaposing the seemingly cheerful activity of gingerbread house making with the unexpected reaction of crying. the phrase ""still makes me cry"" suggests an ongoing, exaggerated negative emotional response to what is typically considered a fun holiday activity. this unexpected pairing and hyperbole are common elements in sarcastic expressions.

this statement contains an unexpected emotional contrast between the mundane activity of making a gingerbread house and the intense emotional reaction of crying. the use of ""still"" implies persistence of this incongruous reaction over time, adding to the sarcastic tone. the casual language style with the ampersand ""&"" further emphasizes the informal, potentially sardonic nature of the comment.

the presence of ""twist"" and ""bizarre"" suggests unexpected or unusual claims. the phrase ""too bizarre to be true"" followed by ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure, implying the opposite of what's stated. the use of vertical bars to separate statements adds emphasis to key points in a way often seen in sarcastic comments.

the ellipsis creates ambiguity that could hint at an unstated negative contrast, potentially setting up sarcasm. however, without stronger cues, this reads as a fairly straightforward statement.

this text contains emotional words, punctuation emphasis, and a rhetorical question, which are potential indicators of sarcasm. the use of ""very stressful"" contrasts with the relatively minor issue of a buffering video feed, creating an exaggerated reaction. the ellipsis and interrobang (?!) add dramatic emphasis. the rhetorical question format also suggests an implied criticism or frustration.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

based on the extracted cues:
- special symbols: #, ...?!
- language style: rhetorical question
- emotional contrasts: stress vs. excitement of a launch
- surface emotion: stress, anxiety

the combination of these cues, particularly the exaggerated stress over a minor inconvenience (buffering) during an exciting event, suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll analyze the input text for sarcasm cues without using any context-related information:

### brief response:
the text contains hashtag overuse which can be a stylistic cue for sarcasm. the phrase structure mimics a serious news headline but the excessive hashtags create an exaggerated, potentially mocking tone. there's a slight contrast between the formal ""american way of life"" concept and the casual hashtag style. however, there are no clear emotional words, special symbols beyond hashtags, or obvious rhetorical devices.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
the text uses excessive hashtags in an exaggerated way, creating an unnatural and mocking tone. the overuse of hashtags for every word in the quote parodies social media practices and appears to mock the seriousness of the statement attributed to obama. this stylistic choice suggests the author is not sincerely sharing news, but rather ridiculing either the statement itself or the way such statements are typically shared online.

this text does not contain clear sarcastic cues. it appears to be a straightforward request for communication, using hashtags and mentions typical of social media platforms.

emotional words: none present
surface emotion: neutral

the lack of emotional language, contrasts, or rhetorical devices suggests this is likely not a sarcastic statement.

this text does not contain clear sarcastic cues. the use of hashtags is unusual but doesn't indicate sarcasm. the message appears to be a straightforward request for contact, expressed in a somewhat disjointed social media style.

### label: not sarcastic",0.0,"### brief response:
this text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. emotional contrast: the use of ""#please"" followed by multiple hashtags with basic words creates a contrast between politeness and frustration.
2. special symbols: excessive use of hashtags, especially for common words.
3. language style: the choppy, hashtag-heavy style mimics exaggerated social media behavior.
4. keywords: the phrase ""but #not#had#reply"" implies frustration in a roundabout way.

the text contains hashtags, exaggerated escalation of actions, and a sense of frustration, which are potential indicators of sarcasm. however, the actions described seem plausible for a genuinely upset customer, and there's no clear contrast between literal and intended meaning.

### label: not sarcastic

while the text has some elements that could suggest sarcasm, there isn't enough evidence to conclusively determine it as sarcastic. the complaint and actions described appear to be straightforward expressions of a dissatisfied customer.",0.0,"### brief response:

this tweet contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

special symbols: hashtags (#att, #wfaa, #not, #stopping)
punctuation: semicolon, periods for emphasis
rhetorical device: escalation of actions (contacting multiple authorities)
surface emotion: frustration implied through the listing of escalating steps

the use of ""#not #stopping"" at the end appears to be a sarcastic way of emphasizing the speaker's determination, rather than literally meaning they are not stopping.

this text exhibits several cues indicating sarcasm:
- language style: exaggerated positive statement about a negative experience

keywords: remember, worked, both jobs, sick, didn't suck

the statement presents a clearly unpleasant situation (working two jobs while sick) but describes it positively (""didn't suck at all""), creating a stark contrast. the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly signals the sarcastic intent, while ""#notworthit"" reinforces the true negative sentiment.

### brief response:

surface emotion: seemingly apologetic
rhetorical devices: exaggeration, mock apology
language style: informal, social media tone
emotional words: ""bad"", ""sorry""
punctuation: regular use of periods, no excessive punctuation

the combination of a mock apology with exaggeration about someone being ""so bad"" suggests this is likely sarcastic teasing rather than a genuine criticism.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"based on analyzing the input text, here is my assessment:

### brief response:
the tweet contains exaggerated criticism of a teammate's soccer skills, using self-deprecating humor to tag the person directly. the contrast between the harsh description and apologetic tone suggests sarcasm.

key elements i noted:
- keywords: ""so bad"", ""runs the line every week"" (exaggeration)
- language style: casual, playful tone
- punctuation: use of periods for emphasis
- emotional contrast: harsh criticism followed by ""i'm sorry to say""
- rhetorical device: hyperbole in describing the teammate's skill level

these cues together indicate the tweet is likely meant sarcastically rather than as a genuine harsh criticism.",1.0,"### brief response:

the mention of toes ""coming back to life"" after a coffee stop during a long ride hints at some mild self-deprecating humor, but doesn't clearly cross into sarcasm territory. the overall tone seems more straightforward than sarcastic.

based on the extracted cues:

- rhetorical device: use of hashtag to negate the statement

these cues, particularly the emotional contrast and use of ""#not"", strongly suggest sarcasm.

this text employs verbal irony and a contrasting hashtag to express sarcasm. the statement ""waking up every couple hours is cool"" is clearly insincere, as disrupted sleep is generally considered unpleasant. the addition of ""|#not"" at the end explicitly negates the preceding statement, emphasizing the sarcastic intent.

this text doesn't contain clear sarcasm indicators. there are no emotional words, contrasts, or special symbols that typically signal sarcasm. the use of ""@"" symbols is for tagging users, not conveying emotion. the content appears to be a straightforward statement about referring to oneself in plural form, without any obvious sarcastic undertones.

### label: not sarcastic",0.0,"### brief response:

this text contains a few elements that could suggest sarcasm:

- special symbols: @ used multiple times
- surface emotion: neutral to slightly mocking tone
- rhetorical devices: implies a consequence without stating it directly
- keywords: ""refer to yourself in the plural"" is an unusual phrase that could be used sarcastically
- punctuation: comma used, but no strong punctuation indicators of sarcasm

this tweet contains a hashtag #irony, which directly signals sarcastic intent. the language style is short and matter-of-fact, presenting a contrast with the use of the irony hashtag. there's no overt emotion expressed, which can sometimes indicate dry sarcasm. the lack of punctuation at the end also contributes to a deadpan delivery often associated with sarcastic statements.

this tweet contains a few potential indicators of sarcasm:

based on the provided text, i cannot confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the text appears to be a social media post with multiple hashtags and does not contain clear indicators of sarcasm.

language style: casual, hashtag-heavy social media style
rhetorical devices: none apparent
surface emotion: neutral/positive
keywords: smile, photo, boys, trouble, funny, football, kids, adorable, friends
punctuation: only hashtags, no other notable punctuation

without additional context or a more substantial statement, there's insufficient evidence to determine if sarcasm is present.

this text does not contain clear sarcastic cues. it's a straightforward hashtag-heavy social media post describing a photo, likely of children posing reluctantly. the tone seems lighthearted rather than sarcastic.

this text displays exaggeration and absurdity by combining the mundane concept of a real estate agency with the artistic movement of surrealism. the use of double exclamation marks emphasizes enthusiasm that seems out of place for a typical business, hinting at irony. the juxtaposition of ""surrealist"" with ""estate agency"" creates an unexpected and humorous contrast.

this text doesn't contain strong indicators of sarcasm based on the requested cues. there are no clear rhetorical devices, emotional words, emotional contrasts, or surface emotions present. the phrase ""we may be some time"" is fairly neutral. the hashtags #hibernot and #not don't provide enough context to determine sarcasm without additional information.

surface emotion: neutral
rhetorical devices: hashtag usage
emotional contrasts: none apparent
punctuation: period, hashtags

without additional context, the text itself does not contain strong indicators of sarcasm. the phrase ""we may be some time"" is ambiguous, and the hashtag ""#hibernot"" is unclear without context. the lack of emotional contrast or obvious rhetorical devices typically associated with sarcasm makes it difficult to definitively classify this as sarcastic based solely on the text provided.

analyzing the text for sarcasm cues:

1. emotional contrasts: the speaker mentions being ""tired and broke"" after a seemingly enjoyable shopping day.
2. keywords: ""haul,"" ""tired and broke""
3. special symbols: none present
4. rhetorical devices: none apparent
5. surface emotion: a mix of excitement (listing purchases) and exhaustion/financial strain

the text shows a contrast between the positive shopping experience and the negative outcome, which could be indicative of sarcasm. however, this could also be a straightforward statement of fact without sarcastic intent.

this text contains a playful insult followed by a winking emoticon, suggesting a friendly tone rather than genuine criticism. the contrast between the seemingly negative ""tough bugger"" and the playful emoticon "";p"" indicates a light-hearted, joking manner. there's no clear emotional contrast or use of rhetorical devices that would typically signal sarcasm.

analyzing the input text for sarcasm cues:

1. emotional contrasts: expectation of chrome working well vs. internet explorer (ie) performing better
2. emotional words: none explicitly present
3. keywords: ""google,"" ""chrome,"" ""ie"" (internet explorer)
4. language style: casual, tweet-like structure
5. punctuation: use of period and hashtag (#)

the irony is highlighted by the unexpected situation where the older, often-mocked ie outperforms google's own browser for a google application. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly points out the sarcastic nature.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

the tweet uses irony to highlight the unexpected success of internet explorer (ie) compared to chrome. it employs a hashtag #irony, contrasts expectations (chrome failing, ie succeeding), and presents a surprising outcome contrary to typical browser performance perceptions.

the excessive smiling emoticon "":))"" could potentially indicate sarcasm, as overemphasis is sometimes used sarcastically. however, without more context, the sincere use of ""grateful"" and the overall positive tone suggest this is likely a genuine expression of gratitude.

based on the input text, i've identified the following cues:

1. language style: casual, conversational tone
2. emotional contrast: positive sentiment (""good things"") vs. negative sentiment (""junk"")

the text appears to have a subtle ironic tone, particularly in the last sentence about tweeting being good for ""building tribe.""

this text contains a mix of seemingly genuine sentiments and subtle contradictions. the speaker starts by expressing a positive intention, but then immediately undercuts it with a self-aware comment about tweeting. the final sentence has an exaggerated, simplistic tone that contrasts with the initial thoughtful statement.

        ### Input:
        #Irony: ""The elections are not over zero VAT, but about whether there will be a Zionist or extremist country here"". http://t.co/SxRoXLVspP

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the provided input, here's my analysis:

### brief response:
keywords: irony, elections, vat, zionist, extremist
emotional contrasts: none apparent
emotional words: extremist
language style: political commentary, use of quotation marks
surface emotion: neutral

the presence of ""#irony"" at the beginning suggests this is intended to be sarcastic, although the content itself doesn't display typical sarcastic cues. the statement appears to be a political commentary presented as irony.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this text contains clear markers of sarcasm, including the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas presented as equivalents. the language style is deliberately provocative and uses exaggeration to make a point.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this text contains several sarcasm cues:
- special symbol: use of hashtag ""#irony""
- keyword: ""irony"" explicitly used
- emotional contrast: framing a serious topic (elections) in an exaggerated, binary way
- rhetorical device: false dichotomy presented between ""zionist or extremist country""
- surface emotion: mockery of the election's supposed simplicity

### brief response:
the text contains the hashtag ""#irony"", which is a strong indicator of intended sarcasm. the juxtaposition between the mundane setting of a work bus and the implied upbeat nature of the song title (without quoting lyrics) creates a contrast that could be read as sarcastic. the phrase ""another day in"" followed by a positive descriptor is often used sarcastically to imply the opposite.

the use of ""#not"" at the end of the statement is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it contradicts the initial claim and is a common online sarcasm marker.",1.0,"### brief response:

this text contains a hashtag contradicting the main statement, which is a common sarcastic device. the phrase ""all about"" exaggerates the importance of twitter, while ""#not"" immediately negates it, creating irony. the casual language style and use of a hashtag as a rhetorical device further support a sarcastic interpretation.

analyzing the text for sarcasm cues:

1. punctuation: none notable
2. rhetorical devices: none apparent
3. keywords: ""#not""

the text uses casual language, an interjection (""lol""), and an emoji to convey amusement at a relatable situation. there are no strong indicators of sarcasm like exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the tone seems genuinely lighthearted rather than mocking.

### label: not sarcastic",0.0,"based on the provided input text, here is my analysis:

### brief response:
this text contains playful mockery of the speaker's mother's inability to multitask, using casual language and an emoji to convey amusement. the ""lol"" and laughing emoji contrast with the stated limitation, creating a mildly sarcastic tone.

cues extracted:
- rhetorical devices: hyperbole (implying complete inability)
- emotional words: ""lol"" (expressing amusement)
- keywords: ""can't"" (highlighting limitation)
- special symbols: 😆 (laughing emoji emphasizing humor)
- language style: casual, conversational

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
based on the extracted cues:
- punctuation: none significant
- keywords: ""lol"" (laughing out loud)
- emotional words: none significant
- emotional contrasts: none
- special symbols: 😆 (laughing emoji)

the use of ""lol"" and the laughing emoji suggest amusement rather than sarcasm. the statement appears to be a straightforward observation about the speaker's mother, expressed with genuine humor.

the exaggerated praise, use of hyperbole, and the ""xd"" emoticon (often used to indicate sarcasm or irony online) strongly suggest this statement is sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0,"### brief response:

surface emotion: positive enthusiasm
emotional contrasts: exaggerated praise vs subtle mockery
punctuation: use of hashtag, no other notable punctuation
language style: casual, internet slang
rhetorical devices: hyperbole, irony

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:
this text contains special symbols (""#"" and ""xd"") and exaggerated praise, which are often indicators of sarcasm. the use of ""xd"" as a laughing emoticon particularly suggests the statement is not meant to be taken seriously. the hyperbolic claim about the game being ""so much better than any fps released in 2014"" also hints at sarcastic intent.

analyzing the input text for sarcasm cues:

1. punctuation: no notable punctuation cues.

3. emotional words: ""like"" (positive)
4. keywords: ""just what i like"" followed by ""#not""
5. rhetorical devices: irony in stating a clearly undesirable condition is liked

the presence of ""#not"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm, directly contradicting the preceding statement.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

1. emotional contrast: expressing a positive sentiment (""just what i like"") about a negative situation (highly inflamed stomach).
2. keywords: use of ""just what i like"" in an inappropriate context.
3. punctuation: use of hashtag #not to negate the previous statement.
4. surface emotion: feigned enthusiasm about an unpleasant medical condition.

the text lacks clear sarcastic markers. the ""haha"" suggests genuine amusement rather than sarcasm. the question seems straightforward without irony or contradiction.

this text contains a few subtle cues that could indicate sarcasm:

1. language style: the casual ""haha"" at the beginning sets a lighthearted tone.
2. emotional contrast: the phrase ""guess my tweet was ok then"" implies uncertainty or self-deprecation, which contrasts with the apparent positive response.
3. punctuation: the lack of a question mark after what seems to be a question (""guess my tweet was ok then"") could be intentional for sarcastic effect.
4. emotional words: ""haha"" expresses amusement, but in context it might be used sarcastically.

however, the cues are not strongly definitive, and the second sentence appears to be a genuine question to someone.

- emotional words: ""fail"" expressed via hashtag.

the combination of these elements, particularly the contrast between the serious topic and the described behavior, along with the use of ""#fail"" and ""#irony"", strongly suggests sarcasm.

analyzing the input for sarcasm cues:

punctuation: no notable punctuation.
keywords: ""kills"", ""friday feeling""
rhetorical devices: juxtaposition of positive (""friday feeling"") and negative (""kills"") concepts
emotional words: ""kills"" (negative)
surface emotion: disappointment, frustration

the statement appears to use irony by contrasting the typically positive ""friday feeling"" with the negative impact of work. the use of ""kills"" dramatically emphasizes this contrast.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this sentence contains an emotional contrast between the typical positive ""friday feeling"" and the negative impact of work. the phrase ""really kills"" is a strong negative expression used ironically. the informal language style also hints at a sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic",1.0,"### brief response:

this sentence contains an emotional contrast between the typically positive ""friday feeling"" and the negative impact of work. the phrase ""really kills"" is hyperbolic language often used in sarcastic expressions. the overall tone implies dissatisfaction with having to work on a friday night, when one would typically expect to relax or celebrate the end of the workweek.

3. emotional contrast: juxtaposing santa (not real) with religious beliefs (declared real)
4. surface emotion: amusement/ridicule
