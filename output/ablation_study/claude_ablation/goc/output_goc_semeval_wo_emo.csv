"Just walked in to #Starbucks and asked for a ""tall blonde"" Hahahaha #irony",1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""tall blonde"" suggests a double meaning, playing on the fact that this is both a starbucks drink size/type and a description of a person.

2. the ""hahahaha"" following the statement indicates the speaker finds humor in the situation, likely due to the double entendre.

3. the use of the hashtag #irony explicitly points out that the speaker is aware of and highlighting the ironic nature of their statement.

4. the overall structure of the tweet, combining the seemingly innocent action with laughter and the irony hashtag, is characteristic of sarcastic humor on social media.

these elements together strongly indicate that the text is meant to be understood as sarcastic, using wordplay and situational irony for humorous effect.",1.0
#NOT GONNA WIN http://t.co/Mc9ebqjAqj,0,"sarcastic

while the text is very brief, there are a few indicators that suggest this could be a sarcastic statement:

1. the use of all caps for ""not gonna win"" adds emphasis and intensity, which is often used in sarcastic expressions.

2. the hashtag format (#not gonna win) is commonly used on social media platforms to highlight a point, and in this case, it could be used ironically.

3. the phrase ""not gonna win"" itself, when used as a hashtag, often carries a sarcastic or ironic tone, especially if it's being used to comment on a situation where someone or something is actually likely to win or succeed.

4. the inclusion of a link suggests there might be additional context that contradicts or complicates the literal meaning of ""not gonna win.""

without more context, it's impossible to be certain, but the combination of these elements leans towards a sarcastic interpretation. the statement appears to be making a point through irony rather than a straightforward prediction of failure.",1.0

"Pips who drop out of school n have Kirya as 'eir role model tht ey wana sing too..guy spix Portuguese,French,english...#Not a school dropout",0,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text appears to be sarcastic because:

2. however, it then contradicts this by stating that kirya speaks multiple languages (portuguese, french, english) and emphasizes ""#not a school dropout"".

3. the contrast between the initial implication of kirya being a role model for school dropouts and the revelation that he is actually multilingual and not a dropout himself creates the sarcastic tone.

4. the informal, shorthand writing style (e.g., ""tht ey wana"") also contributes to the overall sarcastic feel of the message.

Produce Mobile Apps #not http://t.co/3OV57ZhqcH http://t.co/wX1DbI8W9M,1,"sarcastic

based on the current cues and the input text, i believe this tweet is sarcastic. here's why:

1. the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. in social media, especially twitter, adding ""#not"" at the end of a statement is a common way to express that the preceding statement should be interpreted sarcastically or ironically.

2. the brevity of the main text ""produce mobile apps"" followed immediately by ""#not"" suggests that the author is mocking or criticizing the idea of producing mobile apps, rather than genuinely promoting it.

3. the inclusion of two links after the sarcastic statement could be providing contrasting information or examples that support the sarcastic viewpoint, though we can't see the content of these links.

therefore, considering these elements, particularly the use of ""#not"", i confidently label this tweet as ""sarcastic"".",1.0
Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it. -Bill Cosby|#irony,1,"based on the given input and cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

explanation:
the quote is attributed to bill cosby, a formerly respected figure who later faced numerous sexual assault allegations. the use of his quote about desire and fear, followed by the hashtag ""#irony"", creates a clear sarcastic tone. the irony lies in taking advice about overcoming fear from someone who has been accused of exploiting others' vulnerability. the hashtag explicitly signals the sarcastic intent, making this a clear case of sarcasm.",1.0

About as relevant as Michael Sam and Jason Collins. RT @eonline: Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott comes out as gay.,0,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the text appears to be sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the phrase ""about as relevant as"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is not actually relevant or important.

2. the text is comparing the coming out of dale scott (an mlb umpire) to michael sam and jason collins, who were high-profile athletes who came out as gay. by saying it's ""about as relevant,"" the author is likely implying that an umpire coming out is less significant or newsworthy than athletes coming out.

3. the use of ""rt"" (retweet) followed by the news headline suggests that the author is quoting the headline to comment on it sarcastically, rather than simply sharing the information.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the text is meant to be read with sarcasm, downplaying the significance of the news about dale scott coming out as gay.",1.0

"Since the tribunal was established 14 years ago, no complaint against the intelligence services has ever been upheld. #trustthesystem #not",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the content itself presents a seemingly improbable situation - that in 14 years, not a single complaint against intelligence services has been upheld by the tribunal.

2. the use of hashtags, particularly ""#trustthesystem"" followed immediately by ""#not"", is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the ""#not"" directly contradicts and negates the previous hashtag, revealing the author's true skeptical stance.

3. the juxtaposition of the factual statement about no complaints being upheld with the ironic hashtags creates a sarcastic tone, implying disbelief or criticism of the system's effectiveness or fairness.

4. the cues mention that the hashtags ""express skepticism about the system,"" which aligns with interpreting the overall message as sarcastic.

this combination of an unlikely claim followed by contradictory hashtags is a classic structure for expressing sarcasm, especially in social media contexts.",1.0

the informal language, use of hashtags, and concise nature of the tweet are typical of social media communication, but the key to identifying sarcasm here is the content and the author's framing of the situation as ironic. therefore, i can confidently label this tweet as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

reasoning:
1. the text exhibits several characteristics of informal, internet-style communication as mentioned in the cues (use of ""lol"", ellipsis, hashtags, and urls).

At least I don't have to clean the floor,0,"given the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""at least i don't have to clean the floor"" appears to be a genuine expression of relief about not having to perform a specific chore. while it uses understatement to find a positive aspect in what might be an otherwise negative situation, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. the tone is straightforward and the sentiment aligns with the common view that cleaning floors is an undesirable task. the use of ""at least"" suggests the speaker is sincerely looking for a silver lining, rather than making a sarcastic remark.",0.0
Incidentally the foreword for movie #BhopalAPrayerForRain is by Subroto Roy Sahara - saying - justice delayed is justice denied. #Irony,1,"based on the given information and context, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author is pointing out a contradiction or unexpected element in the situation. the irony likely stems from the fact that subroto roy sahara, who is associated with legal troubles and delayed justice in his own affairs, is quoted saying ""justice delayed is justice denied"" in the foreword of a movie about a tragic industrial disaster. this juxtaposition creates a sarcastic tone, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy or irony in sahara's statement given his own circumstances.",1.0
@RadiNabulsi Our 3 losses followed bye weeks & an FCS team. Do we get rid of those next year? #sarcasm,1,"based on the input and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic, as indicated by several factors:

1. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet, which explicitly signals the sarcastic intent.

the keywords extracted, including ""3 losses,"" ""bye weeks,"" ""fcs team,"" and ""sarcasm,"" all support this interpretation. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this input.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuine expression of frustration and disappointment regarding a football game loss. the use of strong language (""embarrassing""), the direct mention of the team's official account (@gopittfootball), and the frustrated hashtag (#wtf) all indicate sincere negative emotions rather than sarcasm. the hyperbole used (""one of the most embarrassing losses"") is likely an earnest exaggeration born out of genuine disappointment, not a sarcastic overstatement. the informal, emotional language style further supports the interpretation that this is a straightforward expression of dissatisfaction with the team's performance.",0.0
@ProFootballTalk untrue - its Cutler's fault,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. it's a short, snappy response, which is common in sarcastic tweets.
2. it contradicts a previous statement (implied by ""untrue"") and then provides an unexpected or exaggerated explanation.

4. the informal tone and structure (missing apostrophe in ""its"") is consistent with casual, sarcastic social media comments.

the presence of the hyphen and the missing apostrophe (which should be in ""its"") align with the punctuation cues provided, further supporting this interpretation. the context of responding to profootballtalk, a sports news account, also suggests this is likely a fan making a sarcastic comment about football-related news or discussions.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of the hashtag ""#excitingtimes"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this combination creates a deliberate contradiction, where the author first suggests excitement and then immediately negates it. this is a common sarcastic technique used in social media to express frustration or disappointment in a situation (in this case, likely the mundane task of testing water temperatures) by ironically calling it exciting and then immediately contradicting that statement.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a genuine compliment about jan ellis's writing style.
2. the tone is positive and appreciative, mentioning specific qualities like hope, precision, humor, and irony.
3. while humor and irony are mentioned, they are presented as positive attributes of the writing, not as indicators of sarcasm in the tweet itself.

5. the inclusion of a link at the end suggests this is a sincere recommendation or review of jan ellis's work.

therefore, this tweet appears to be a straightforward, positive comment about an author's writing style and is not sarcastic.",0.0

"The Bay Area storm is so big that tons of people's work was canceled today, causing me to be early to mine. #irony #stormageddon",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text for the following reasons:

1. the use of hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#stormageddon"" are strong indicators of sarcastic intent. the author is explicitly signaling their sarcastic tone.

2. the content presents a situation that subverts expectations. typically, severe storms cause delays or closures, but in this case, the author claims to be early to work because of cancellations elsewhere.

3. the exaggerated term ""stormageddon"" further suggests a mocking or sarcastic tone towards the overreaction to the storm.

4. the phrase ""so big that"" sets up an expectation of severe consequences, but the actual result (being early to work) is relatively mundane, creating a humorous contrast typical of sarcasm.

these elements, combined with the explicit mention of irony, strongly indicate that the text is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message rather than sarcastic content. the use of capitalization, hashtags, and multiple links is typical for social media marketing tactics, especially on platforms like twitter where character limits necessitate concise communication. the message is directly promoting a way to make money through a new app, which is consistent with common online marketing practices. the language and structure of the tweet, while informal and abbreviated, don't contain any obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony. therefore, based on the content and style of the message, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
Take me tooooo church #not,0,"considering the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

### label: sarcastic

explanation:
this text is likely sarcastic for a few reasons:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the hashtag ""not"" is commonly used on social media to denote that the preceding statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning.

2. the elongated ""tooooo"" (which was normalized to ""to"" in the keyword extraction) adds an exaggerated tone to the statement, often associated with sarcasm or mock enthusiasm.

3. the phrase ""take me to church"" is a popular song title, but when combined with the exaggerated spelling and the ""#not"" tag, it's being used in a sarcastic context, likely to express the opposite sentiment - a reluctance or refusal to go to church.

therefore, the overall message is sarcastic, using irony to express a sentiment contrary to the literal meaning of ""take me to church.""",1.0
"A 'republican move' which will 'effectively rob the royals'. Kate's spending 32k on1meal, who is being robbed? #irony http://t.co/OTbeWggbTJ",1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of quotation marks around 'republican move' and 'effectively rob the royals', suggesting skepticism or mockery of these phrases.

2. the contrast between the idea of royals being ""robbed"" and kate spending an extravagant amount (32k) on a single meal.

3. the rhetorical question ""who is being robbed?"" which implies that the royals are not the ones being robbed, contrary to the initial statement.

4. the explicit use of the hashtag #irony, which directly signals the sarcastic intent of the tweet.

5. the overall tone that juxtaposes the notion of royals being ""robbed"" with their lavish spending, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic commentary on royal spending and the perception of their financial situation. the tweet is using irony to criticize or mock either the royals' extravagance or those who claim the royals are being ""robbed"" despite their wealth.",1.0

while the ""do not wake up"" part might seem contradictory to a morning greeting, it's more likely a playful reference to the desire to stay in bed, which is a common sentiment shared on social media in the morning. this doesn't appear to be sarcastic, but rather a casual, relatable post meant to engage with followers.

the abundance of hashtags, the informal style, and the inclusion of social media-specific terms (like ""instadaily"" and ""snapchat"") are all consistent with sincere social media communication rather than sarcasm. therefore, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

work Wednesday-Sunday .. #yay #not #moneytho 😩😭💰😒,1,"label: sarcastic

this tweet displays clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""#yay"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure, where a positive statement is immediately contradicted.

2. the conflicting emojis (😩😭💰😒) further reinforce the sarcastic tone. the money bag emoji (💰) represents the positive aspect of earning money, but it's surrounded by negative emotions (crying, tired, unamused faces).

3. the phrase ""moneytho"" (money though) implies that earning money is the only positive aspect of this work schedule, but it's not enough to outweigh the negative feelings.

4. the ellipsis after stating the work schedule (""work wednesday-sunday .."") suggests a pause for effect, often used in sarcastic or ironic statements.

the overall tone conveys dissatisfaction with the work schedule, while sarcastically acknowledging the benefit of earning money. this mix of conflicting emotions and contradictory expressions is a hallmark of sarcastic communication.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of ""wow"" at the beginning, followed by ""look what..."" suggests a sarcastic tone. the tweet is drawing attention to the irony of an nfl player who previously made a ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture (associated with protests against police brutality) now being arrested. the contrast between the player's past actions and current situation is being highlighted in a way that implies sarcasm or irony. the hashtag #ferguson further contextualizes this within the broader discussion of racial issues and police interactions, adding to the sarcastic undertone of the message.",1.0

Am I the only one who finds it very stressful when the #OrionLaunch feed keeps buffering...?!,0,"based on the cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text exhibits characteristics of sarcasm:

1. rhetorical question: ""am i the only one..."" is often used sarcastically to imply that many people likely feel the same way.

2. exaggeration: describing the buffering as ""very stressful"" is likely an overstatement for comedic effect.

3. context: the frustration with buffering during an important space launch event is relatable, and using sarcasm to express this frustration is common.

4. punctuation: the use of ""...?!"" at the end adds emphasis and suggests a tone that's more dramatic than sincere.

the author is likely using sarcasm to humorously comment on the irony of advanced space technology being hindered by common streaming issues, making light of their frustration with the viewing experience.",1.0

Never seen the gym so packed,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis, i would assign the label ""not sarcastic"" to the input text ""never seen the gym so packed.""

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward observation about an unusually crowded gym.
2. while there is a use of hyperbole (""never seen""), this is a common emphatic device in casual speech and doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.
3. the context and common knowledge information suggest this is likely a genuine remark about an atypical situation at the gym.
4. there are no clear indicators of irony or contrary meaning that would suggest sarcasm.
5. the informal, concise style is consistent with a sincere comment rather than a sarcastic one.

therefore, the most probable interpretation is that this is a literal, non-sarcastic statement expressing surprise at how crowded the gym is.",0.0

1. the content of the message is clearly sarcastic. the statement ""yes, and conventional taxis drive verrrry safely"" is meant to be understood as the opposite of what it literally says.

4. the punctuation cues, including the multiple @ symbols and hashtags, are consistent with informal social media communication where sarcasm is often employed.

3. the tweet connects two seemingly unrelated events (delhi elections and border shelling) in a way that implies a manipulative political strategy, which is characteristic of sarcastic commentary on politics.
4. the tone suggests skepticism about the integrity of political processes, using irony to criticize potential attempts to distract from election issues.

Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top UNLESS YOU'RE SKINNY #Shade #Sarcasm #TheMoreYouKnow,0,"label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the first part mimics a body-positive message, but then it abruptly shifts to contradict itself with ""unless you're skinny"" in all caps for emphasis. this sudden reversal is a classic sarcastic technique. 

the use of hashtags, especially #sarcasm, explicitly signals the sarcastic intent. the other hashtags (#shade and #themoreyouknow) further reinforce the mocking tone. 

the contrast between the seemingly positive opening and the critical ending, combined with the explicit sarcasm tag, leaves no doubt that this is a sarcastic statement critiquing inconsistencies in body positivity messages.",1.0

2. stereotypical statement: ""ladies love the calves!"" is a humorous exaggeration of what women find attractive.

3. hashtag use: the series of hashtags breaking up the phrase ""#not #about #the #arms #its #about..."" adds to the comedic effect and implies a mock-serious tone.

4. contrast between subject and importance: focusing on calf muscles as if they're a major attraction is likely meant to be humorous.

5. social media context: this type of exaggerated, self-deprecating humor is common in social media posts aiming for comedic effect.

4. the context (looking forward to an upcoming academic semester) is a common and relatable situation where excitement would be genuine.
5. there's no discrepancy between the words used and the likely intended meaning that would hint at sarcasm.

"@MericaMcFreedom @Heritage Actually, even delivery won't save some. O voted to let born alive die. Also, look up ""4th trimester abortions"".",0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the input text contains exaggerated and false claims about ""4th trimester abortions"" and misrepresents complex political issues in a way that appears intentionally absurd. the suggestion to ""look up '4th trimester abortions'"" is particularly indicative of sarcasm, as this concept does not exist and is biologically impossible. the tone and content strongly suggest the author is using sarcasm to make a political point rather than presenting factual information.",1.0

What a great way to start the day!! #Not 😠,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. the exclamation marks (!!) are used excessively, which often indicates exaggeration or insincerity.

2. the use of ""#not"" is a direct indicator of sarcasm. it contradicts the seemingly positive statement before it, revealing that the speaker means the opposite of what they initially said.

3. the angry face emoji (😠) at the end further confirms that the speaker is not actually having a great start to their day, but rather a frustrating one.

the combination of these elements - the overly enthusiastic exclamations, the contradictory hashtag, and the angry emoji - creates a classic sarcastic statement where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning. the speaker is expressing frustration about their day starting poorly, not genuinely saying it's great.",1.0

5. there's no contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
6. the informal and conversational tone is consistent with expressing a genuine thought rather than a sarcastic comment.

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""liberated,"" implying skepticism about iraq's supposed liberation.
2. the stark contrast between the claim of liberation and the high death toll mentioned.
3. the phrase ""thank you, western liberators"" followed by the explicit #sarcasm hashtag.
4. the overall tone of bitter irony in juxtaposing the concept of liberation with extreme violence.

the tweet exhibits clear sarcastic qualities:

1. it playfully encourages followers to tag a teammate who is ""so bad"" that they're relegated to being a linesman every week, which is a humorous exaggeration.

2. the author tags a specific person (@sam__clough) with an apologetic preface ""i'm sorry to say,"" which adds to the playful, teasing tone.

3. the combination of the seemingly harsh criticism (""so bad"") with the lighthearted context of tagging friends in social media posts suggests that this is not meant to be taken literally.

4. the account name ""@sundaychants"" implies this is likely a sports-related humor account, further supporting the sarcastic interpretation.

this type of playful ribbing among teammates or sports fans is a common form of sarcasm in social media interactions related to sports.",1.0

2. the use of double question marks (??) often implies exaggerated disbelief or mock surprise, which is commonly associated with sarcastic tone.

3. the content of the message itself appears to be questioning an implied generalization about blonde white women, which is likely not meant to be taken at face value.

2. the informal, personal tone is typical of sincere social media posts or messages to friends.

4. the context suggests this is a straightforward expression of gratitude for social connections.
5. there are no contradictory elements or subtle cues that would indicate sarcasm.

therefore, based on the language, tone, and context, this statement is most likely not sarcastic, but a sincere expression of appreciation for the people in the speaker's life.",0.0
@jthurgood1 @Cameron_Gray republicans suck more at identifying #irony than alanis morissette.,0,"sarcastic

i've assigned the label ""sarcastic"" to this text based on the following reasoning:

1. the statement is making a hyperbolic comparison between republicans and alanis morissette in their ability to identify irony.

2. alanis morissette is often jokingly associated with misunderstanding irony due to her song ""ironic,"" which many people have pointed out contains situations that are not actually ironic.

3. the use of ""suck more at"" is informal and exaggerated language, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic statements.

4. the inclusion of the #irony hashtag further emphasizes the sarcastic nature of the comment, as the author is explicitly calling attention to the irony in their own statement.

5. the overall tone and structure of the tweet suggest it's meant to be a humorous jab rather than a serious critique.

this combination of exaggeration, cultural reference, informal language, and explicit irony tagging strongly indicates that the statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward observation.",1.0

I need to get out of this car before I kill my dad.,0,"based on the comprehensive analysis of the cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
while the statement is hyperbolic and dramatic, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the speaker seems to be expressing genuine frustration and anger towards their father during a car ride. the use of hyperbole (""before i kill my dad"") is likely an exaggeration of their feelings rather than a sarcastic remark. the informal, direct, and blunt language style, combined with the first-person perspective, suggests a sincere expression of intense emotions rather than sarcasm. the lack of typical sarcastic markers (like irony or mocking tone) further supports this classification.",0.0

explanation:
this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration with chris brown's behavior. the author is being sincere in their criticism, describing brown as a ""chronic loose cannon"" and expressing disappointment in his actions. the use of ""everytime i try to like chris brown"" suggests a genuine attempt to view him favorably, but his actions consistently disappoint the author. the tone and wording do not indicate any irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. instead, it's a direct critique of brown's behavior and its impact on the author's opinion of him.",0.0

Look good feel good! #not #TeamNoSleep #cantopeneyes,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

### label:
sarcastic

explanation:
the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the initial statement ""look good feel good!"" is a positive affirmation.
2. however, this is immediately contradicted by the hashtags that follow:
   - ""#not"" directly negates the previous statement, a common sarcastic device.
   - ""#teamnosleep"" and ""#cantopeneyes"" imply exhaustion, which contrasts with looking and feeling good.

the use of contradictory elements (positive statement followed by negative hashtags) is a classic sarcastic technique. the exclamation mark in the first part emphasizes the false positivity, making the contrast with the following hashtags even more stark. this structure is typical of sarcastic social media posts where the hashtags are used to reveal the true, opposite meaning of the initial statement.",1.0
How much did it cost to build #mygov #medicare? I see this way too often... http://t.co/N0Pdpiq1RQ,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i would assign the label:

2. the phrase ""i see this way too often..."" implies frustration or criticism, which is often expressed through sarcasm.
3. the ellipsis (...) can indicate a trailing thought or pause for effect, often used in sarcastic statements.
4. the combination of the question about cost and the comment about frequency suggests the speaker is implying these systems are expensive and problematic.
5. the inclusion of a link at the end implies there may be some information or news story related to the cost or issues with these systems, which the speaker is sarcastically drawing attention to.

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, the structure and tone of this tweet strongly suggest a sarcastic intent rather than a genuine inquiry about costs.",1.0

Rejoice in knowing he is now in his new place...#not easy,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several indicators of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""rejoice"" contrasts sharply with the somber topic of someone's passing, creating verbal irony.
2. the euphemistic phrase ""he is now in his new place"" is a gentle way to refer to death, but pairing it with ""rejoice"" creates a discordant tone.
3. the ellipsis (...) at the end of the main sentence suggests a trailing off or hesitation, implying there's more to be said or felt.
4. the hashtag ""#not easy"" at the end directly contradicts the instruction to ""rejoice,"" confirming the sarcastic intent.

the combination of these elements - the inappropriate positive emotion (""rejoice""), the euphemism for death, the ellipsis, and the contradictory hashtag - strongly indicates that the speaker is using sarcasm to express the difficulty of dealing with loss, rather than actually encouraging rejoicing.",1.0

3. the juxtaposition of serious accusations with the hashtag #irony suggests that the author is using sarcasm to make a point about the person or situation they're referring to.

4. the context of mocking food bank users alongside other negative traits implies a criticism through sarcastic overstatement.

5. the structure of the tweet, listing negative qualities and ending with #irony, is a common format for sarcastic comments on social media.

I wonder how many people who visit food banks have huge TVs or are drunks? #freedomofspeech #foodbanks,0,"label: sarcastic

this text is likely meant to be sarcastic. the author is using a rhetorical question to imply criticism of food bank users, suggesting they may be misusing resources or undeserving of help. the use of stereotypes (having ""huge tvs"" or being ""drunks"") alongside the serious topic of food banks creates a jarring contrast typical of sarcasm. 

the hashtag #freedomofspeech further suggests the author is aware they're expressing a controversial opinion, potentially using sarcasm as a shield for criticism. the juxtaposition of this hashtag with #foodbanks adds to the sarcastic tone.

Yay jury duty 😒 #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

the input text ""yay jury duty 😒 #sarcasm"" is clearly sarcastic. this judgment is highly reliable based on the following cues:

2. the content itself is presenting an action (posting smoking videos/pictures) as if it's desirable, when it's actually being criticized.

3. the use of ""#socool"" is clearly ironic, implying that the behavior is actually not cool at all.

5. the final hashtag ""#gtfo"" (get the f*** out) expresses clear disapproval of the behavior described.

6. the overall tone is mildly confrontational and critical, which aligns with the cues provided about the language style.

label: sarcastic

explanation: 
the text appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the combination of hashtags creates a contradictory and absurd message. ""#average"" and ""#ball"" alongside ""#party"" and ""#homedecor"" suggests an ironic take on using a plain object for something more exciting.

2. the juxtaposition of ""ping pong"" with ""homedecor"" implies a humorous or unconventional use of a ping pong ball for home decoration, which is likely not meant to be taken seriously.

3. the use of multiple, seemingly unrelated hashtags is often a technique used in sarcastic social media posts to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.

4. the brief, choppy style of the post, combined with the request to retweet, suggests that the author is making a joke or mocking typical social media behavior.

5. without additional context, using a ping pong ball for home decor seems unusual, further supporting the idea that this is a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine suggestion.

the overall tone and structure of the post strongly indicate that it's meant to be read as sarcastic rather than a sincere statement about home decoration.",1.0

1. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates the author's intent.

2. the exaggerated laughter ""ahahahaha"" is often used to signal sarcasm in written communication.

"BM ""gives me"" from 3 pm to 8 pm with my son today, that's fair huh? #NOT!",1,"based on the content and linguistic cues in the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""gives me"" suggests skepticism about the genuineness of the action.
2. the phrase ""that's fair huh?"" is a rhetorical question implying the opposite - that the speaker doesn't actually think it's fair.
3. the hashtag ""#not!"" at the end is a very explicit marker of sarcasm, directly contradicting the previous statement.
4. the overall tone of the message conveys frustration with limited time given (only 5 hours) for the speaker to be with their son, which they sarcastically refer to as ""fair.""

the tweet contains several elements that strongly indicate sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""lesson learnt?"" is often used sarcastically to point out when people haven't actually learned from their mistakes.

Tomorrow three test signature.|Thank you. |#school #sarcasm,1,"based on the input text and the additional context provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this label are:

1. the presence of the hashtag #sarcasm is a direct indicator that the message is intended to be sarcastic.

2. the brevity and seemingly mundane nature of the message about ""three test signatures"" contrasts with the formal ""thank you,"" which can be interpreted as an exaggerated or insincere expression of gratitude.

3. the context mentioning that hashtags suggest it's related to school supports the interpretation that this is likely a student making a sarcastic comment about having to sign or get signatures for tests, which is often seen as a tedious task.

4. the use of hashtags in general, especially #school along with #sarcasm, reinforces the idea that this is a casual, social media-style post where sarcasm is commonly employed.

therefore, considering all these factors, the text can be confidently labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

the text exhibits clear sarcasm in its criticism of the language used by the person being addressed. the statement ""ladies wouldn't use that language"" followed by ""but i guess you are not one"" is a sarcastic remark implying that the person's use of inappropriate language disqualifies them from being considered a lady. this fits the typical structure of sarcasm, where a seemingly polite or straightforward statement is immediately followed by a contradictory or insulting implication.",1.0
@RosieMorse I hate you lol,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the phrase ""i hate you lol"" is a clear example of sarcasm. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) immediately following the statement ""i hate you"" indicates that the speaker doesn't actually mean what they're saying. this is a common form of playful, sarcastic interaction in social media, where people express mock negative sentiments towards friends or acquaintances they actually like. the contrast between the strong negative statement and the laughing indicator creates the sarcastic tone.",1.0

Oh how I love working in Baltimore #not,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicator is the use of ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to denote sarcasm on social media platforms. the statement ""oh how i love working in baltimore"" is expressed in a seemingly positive way, but the ""#not"" immediately negates and reverses the meaning, revealing the speaker's true negative sentiment about working in baltimore. the informal tone, exclamatory opening with ""oh,"" and the use of a hashtag all contribute to the sarcastic style typical of social media posts.",1.0

@Margoandhow @imalexbeamyrnot spawn of Larry Ellison aka World's Worst Human,0,"sarcastic

this tweet is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. hyperbole: the use of ""world's worst human"" is an extreme exaggeration, which is a common sarcastic device.

2. informal tone: the casual language and use of ""aka"" (also known as) to introduce such an extreme label suggests a mocking or sarcastic tone.

3. context: larry ellison is a controversial figure, but calling him the ""world's worst human"" is clearly an overstatement, indicating sarcasm rather than a literal assessment.

4. social media context: twitter often features sarcastic or hyperbolic statements for effect.

5. indirect criticism: using sarcasm to criticize public figures is a common tactic on social media.

"Google scholarship application kept crashing in Chrome. Opened it in IE, finished application without incident. #irony",1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a direct indicator of sarcasm.

2. there's an ironic situation presented: a google scholarship application (presumably related to web technologies) works better in internet explorer (ie) than in google's own chrome browser.

4. the brevity and informal tone are consistent with sarcastic comments on social media.

### label:
sarcastic

explanation:
the text is sarcastic because:

Hoar frost is challenging for some to spell.,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the sentence ""hoar frost is challenging for some to spell."" is a straightforward, factual statement. it doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the tone is neutral and informative, and the language is direct and clear. the statement simply points out a genuine difficulty some people might have with spelling an uncommon term, which is a reasonable observation without any sarcastic intent.",0.0
@AusPublica @KateOnTheGo Your views are not right wing or left wing...just vile.,0,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

this statement is sarcastic because:

1. the structure of the sentence initially appears to be setting up a neutral or positive comment by saying the views are ""not right wing or left wing,"" which might suggest a balanced perspective.

2. however, it then takes an unexpected turn with the use of ""...just vile,"" which is a strong negative descriptor.

3. the contrast between the seemingly neutral setup and the harsh conclusion creates a sarcastic tone.

4. the use of ellipsis (...) adds to the sarcastic delivery, creating a pause for dramatic effect before the insult.

5. the overall context suggests that the speaker is criticizing the views of @auspublica and @kateonthego in a mocking manner, rather than making a straightforward statement.

this combination of factors strongly indicates that the statement is meant to be read as sarcastic rather than literal.",1.0

sarcastic

the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end of the tweet explicitly indicates that the author is being sarcastic. additionally, the content of the tweet is clearly not meant to be taken literally, as it sarcastically implies a connection between the gamergate movement and ebola deaths, which is absurd and intended to mock such a notion.",1.0

the text appears to be a direct, confrontational accusation rather than a sarcastic statement. the tone is accusatory and serious, with no apparent irony or humor that would indicate sarcasm. the capitalization of ""you"" for emphasis and the direct addressing of multiple twitter users further reinforce the earnest, non-sarcastic nature of the accusation. the statement is making a straightforward claim about the alleged violent nature of the addressed parties' tweets, which doesn't align with typical sarcastic constructions.",0.0
Gael 'pro at presentations' Anderson #not #choke,1,"based on the extracted keywords and the structure of the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the use of hashtags ""#not"" and ""#choke"" in combination with the phrase ""pro at presentations"" in quotation marks strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is likely implying that gael anderson is actually not good at presentations, using irony to make this point. the hashtag ""#not"" is a common way to denote sarcasm in social media, essentially negating the previous statement. the addition of ""#choke"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone, suggesting that anderson tends to choke or perform poorly during presentations, contrary to being a ""pro.""",1.0
Nothing says nature like the relentless sound of AM commuter traffic #fthunter #AMdogfun #not@allpeaceful,1,"sarcastic

Loving how dominant the SEC is #Pause ..... #Not,1,"sarcastic

2. the hashtag ""#pause"" which creates a dramatic pause for effect.
3. the final hashtag ""#not"" which explicitly negates the opening statement.

the phrase ""loving how dominant the sec is"" is meant ironically. the author is actually expressing frustration or disagreement with the sec's (southeastern conference) dominance in college sports. the use of ""#not"" at the end confirms that the opening statement should be interpreted in the opposite way, which is a classic sarcastic structure.",1.0

3. the content itself is expressing an obviously undesirable situation (throwing up early in the morning) as something the speaker wants, which is clearly not meant to be taken literally.

4. the use of multiple sick face emojis (😷😷😷) further emphasizes the unpleasantness of the situation, contrasting with the ostensibly positive statement.

Full on man flu just in time for a weekend of work!! #awesome #sarcasm #coldandflu,1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly used, which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be understood as sarcastic.

3. the phrase ""full on man flu just in time for a weekend of work"" followed by ""#awesome"" is contradictory. getting sick before a working weekend would not typically be considered awesome, so this juxtaposition suggests sarcasm.

4. the use of ""#coldandflu"" further reinforces the negative situation, contrasting with the false positivity expressed in ""#awesome"", which strengthens the sarcastic tone.

these elements combined strongly indicate that the text is intended to be sarcastic, mocking the unfortunate timing of getting sick right before having to work on the weekend.",1.0

explanation:
this tweet is clearly sarcastic in nature. the author is using exaggeration and negative stereotyping to make a pointed criticism about the content of the leaked sony emails. the tone is mocking and derisive, implying that the emails revealed unflattering information about sony executives. the use of hashtag #sonyhack at the end further confirms that this is a commentary on the actual incident mentioned in the cues. the sweeping generalizations and deliberately insulting language (""ugly people, stupid & need to learn how to spell"") are typical hallmarks of sarcastic expression, used here to emphasize the author's disapproval of what was revealed in the leaked emails.",1.0

the text ""love waking up to no heat in my apartment"" is clearly sarcastic. the speaker is expressing frustration about having no heat in their apartment, but using the word ""love"" ironically. this irony is further emphasized by the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#socold"", which reinforce the sarcastic tone. the use of hashtags, especially ""#not"", is a common way to indicate sarcasm in social media posts. the contrast between ""love"" and the clearly unpleasant situation of having no heat, combined with the hashtags, strongly indicates that this statement is sarcastic.",1.0
Nice weather for today.. #not 😠,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

2. the ellipsis (..) after ""today"" suggests a pause or trailing off, which can indicate that the speaker is implying something contrary to what they've just said.

3. the angry face emoji (😠) at the end reinforces the negative sentiment, contrasting with the initially positive ""nice weather"" statement.

4. the combination of these elements - the positive opening statement, the contradicting hashtag, and the angry emoji - creates a sarcastic tone that implies the weather is actually not nice at all.

this text is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning.",1.0
"Decided I'd go to bed ""early"" for once. I've been laying here since 2 am. Yet the total amount of sleep I've had all week is 10 hrs. #irony",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. here's why:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""early"" suggests irony, as the author's idea of going to bed early didn't work out as intended.

2. the author mentions lying awake since 2 am, which contradicts the idea of getting to sleep early.

3. the statement about only getting 10 hours of sleep total for the entire week is extremely low, highlighting the irony of trying to go to bed early but still ending up severely sleep-deprived.

4. the hashtag #irony at the end explicitly indicates the author's sarcastic intent.

5. the contrast between the attempt to improve sleep habits and the actual poor outcome perfectly encapsulates sarcasm.

these elements, combined with the common knowledge about sleep habits provided in the cues, clearly point to a sarcastic tone in the text.",1.0

4. the use of absolute terms like ""everyone"" and the juxtaposition of long-term versus short-term relationships creates a subtle exaggeration typical of sarcastic expressions.

2. the statement contradicts reality. joel embiid is a star player, and while the philadelphia 76ers may be struggling, they are not actually ""the worst team in nba history.""

Taking a hour to shit is always a good thing. #not,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic based on several cues:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a common social media indicator of sarcasm, essentially negating the statement that came before it.

2. the content itself is somewhat absurd - spending an hour on a bodily function is not typically considered positive, so stating it as ""always a good thing"" sets up the sarcastic twist.

3. the informal tone and use of profanity contribute to the overall casual, humorous style often associated with sarcastic comments.

4. the brevity and structure of the statement, followed by the contradicting hashtag, is a typical format for sarcastic quips on social media.

given these factors, especially the explicit ""#not"" indicator, we can confidently label this text as ""sarcastic"".",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:

this message appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. contextual incongruity: there's a humorous contrast between the serious athletic action of a header in soccer/football and concern for one's hairstyle, which wouldn't typically be a priority during a sports match.
