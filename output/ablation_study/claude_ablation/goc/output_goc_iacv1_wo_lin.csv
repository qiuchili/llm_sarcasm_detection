And the answer is: we don't know. Maybe it came from nowhere. Maybe it was created. We don't know.,0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward expression of uncertainty about the origin of something, likely referring to a complex philosophical or scientific question. the repetition of ""we don't know"" and the presentation of multiple possibilities without favoring any particular one suggest a genuine acknowledgment of human limitations in understanding certain concepts. the tone is matter-of-fact and does not contain any indicators of irony or sarcasm. therefore, i confidently label this text as ""not sarcastic.""",0
That sentence doesn't even make sense. Did it occur to you that you should actually think about what you are going to say and express actual ideas?,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

the input text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. it starts with a direct criticism (""that sentence doesn't even make sense""), which is often used in sarcastic comments to highlight perceived absurdity.

2. the rhetorical question (""did it occur to you..."") is a common sarcastic device used to emphasize the speaker's point in a mocking way.

3. the suggestion to ""actually think"" and ""express actual ideas"" implies that the person being addressed is not doing so, which is a sarcastic way of calling someone unintelligent or careless in their communication.

4. the overall tone is critical and confrontational, as noted in the cues, which aligns with sarcastic expression.

these elements combined create a sarcastic message that criticizes someone's ability to communicate effectively while implying their lack of thought or substance in their statements.",1
From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that. Your clearly very wrong.,0,"based on the input text and the lack of additional context, i'll provide my best assessment:

### label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone of the statement is confrontational and emphatic, using phrases like ""very clear"" and ""clearly very wrong,"" which can often be indicators of sarcasm, especially in online discussions.

2. the use of capitalization for emphasis (""did not"") is a common technique in sarcastic online communication.

3. the statement appears to be a rebuttal to a previous claim, and sarcasm is often employed in such rebuttals, particularly in debates about controversial topics like the nra.

4. the phrase ""from your own link"" suggests the speaker is using the other person's source against them, which is a common sarcastic debate tactic.

however, i want to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the conversation and the individuals involved, this assessment is not definitive. the statement could potentially be sincere if the speaker is genuinely frustrated and trying to correct misinformation.",1
You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.,0,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a direct, heated response in an argument. the writer is expressing genuine frustration and accusation towards another person, defending their own position while criticizing their opponent's approach. the language is confrontational and serious, lacking the indirect or humorous elements typically associated with sarcasm. the emotional contrasts highlighted in the cues further support that this is a sincere, albeit angry, expression of the writer's views rather than a sarcastic statement.",0
"Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.   In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.   BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336",0,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
the text appears to be a serious, detailed argument against the idea that nylon-eating bacteria provide evidence for evolution. the author presents multiple points, cites sources, and engages in a logical (from their perspective) debate about the interpretation of the bacterial adaptation. while the text is argumentative and critical of evolutionary explanations, it does not employ sarcasm as a rhetorical device. instead, it uses direct statements, analogies, and citations to make its case. the tone is that of sincere disagreement and attempted persuasion, rather than mockery or irony characteristic of sarcasm.",0
"So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?",0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine inquiry about opinions on abortion legislation, without any evident sarcastic tone or intent. the questions posed seem to be aimed at sparking a serious discussion about the ethical and legal implications of abortion laws. the phrasing is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious irony, exaggeration, or contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, based on the content and context provided, this text is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"Wow. A very unusual and distressing story, and probably why saline abortions are no longer used.   It is very unfortunate for her to have to live with that disability.",0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine expression of concern and sympathy regarding a distressing situation related to saline abortions. the author expresses surprise (""wow""), acknowledges the unusual and distressing nature of the story, and shows empathy for the person living with a disability as a result. the tone is sincere and lacks any indicators of sarcasm or irony.",0

Can't your religion survive a little mockery?   On the other hand I can understand why your worried your religion being so ridiculous and all.,0,"based on the input text and the identified emotional cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. it uses a rhetorical question (""can't your religion survive a little mockery?"") to mock the idea that religion should be protected from criticism.

2. the phrase ""i can understand why you're worried"" is not genuinely sympathetic, but rather sets up the sarcastic punchline.

3. the conclusion ""your religion being so ridiculous and all"" is a direct, mocking insult delivered in a casual tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

the emotional cues identified (mockery, worried, ridiculous) further support this interpretation, as they accurately capture the critical and dismissive tone of the statement. the combination of these elements creates a clear sarcastic intent in criticizing the religion being discussed.",1
"But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution, which is based on lies and deceptions, they prove right there that they haven't enough knowledge of the truth, nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie. So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend?   I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.   So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it.",0,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

this text appears to be a sincere expression of the author's views against evolution, rather than a sarcastic statement. the author is presenting their genuine beliefs and arguments, however misguided or factually incorrect they may be. the language is direct, confrontational, and passionate, which is characteristic of someone earnestly defending their position rather than employing sarcasm.",0
"Nobody I know sanctions adultery. There are already serious consequences built in against it. As far a same sex marriage, I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty.

Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished.",0,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text presents a straightforward, matter-of-fact discussion of adultery and same-sex marriage.
2. the language used is neutral and informative, without exaggeration or irony typically associated with sarcasm.

Another oft-repeated lie.,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the phrase ""another oft-repeated lie"" is a straightforward statement expressing frustration or disapproval of misinformation being spread.
2. there's no clear contrast between the literal meaning and an intended meaning, which is typically present in sarcasm.
3. the emotional tone (negative, disapproving) aligns directly with the literal meaning of the words.
4. without additional context that might suggest irony or an unexpected twist, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of annoyance at repeated falsehoods.

while the statement is critical and potentially emphatic, it doesn't exhibit the hallmarks of sarcasm, such as irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. therefore, i believe ""not sarcastic"" is the most appropriate label for this input.",0

"The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern. This pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft. Even this only works at low altitudes. Modern planes typically fly at ~30K feet. That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none. That is why anti-aircraft guns are full auto, not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally.",0,"not sarcastic

the input text is a straightforward, technical explanation of anti-aircraft guns, specifically the quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun. it provides factual information about the weapon's design, functionality, and limitations without any apparent sarcasm or irony. the text maintains a neutral, informative tone throughout, discussing the mechanics of the gun, the challenges of hitting aircraft at high altitudes, and the reasons for its fully automatic design. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. therefore, the correct label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0
"And sometimes, necessary.",0,"based on the limited context provided and the current cues, i cannot reliably determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the phrase ""and sometimes, necessary"" is too brief and lacks sufficient context to make a definitive judgment about its sarcastic intent. without knowing what precedes this statement or understanding the broader conversation, it's impossible to detect any irony or sarcasm.

the phrase could be a sincere acknowledgment that something is occasionally necessary, or it could potentially be a sarcastic comment depending on the context it's used in and the tone of delivery. however, given the information available, i cannot confidently assign either the ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" label.",0

All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the ""religious right"" feel the same way.",0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward, factual presentation of voting data comparing same-sex marriage ban results to presidential election results in various us states. the author is providing specific percentages and drawing conclusions based on the data without any apparent sarcastic tone or intent.

the content aligns with the context and topic information provided in the cues, discussing state-by-state voting results on same-sex marriage bans compared to the 2004 presidential election. the text highlights the larger margins by which these bans passed compared to the presidential election results, suggesting that support for the bans extended beyond just conservative or republican voters.

the language used is matter-of-fact and analytical, lacking any obvious irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm. the final sentence, while drawing a conclusion, does so in a straightforward manner without any apparent sarcastic undertones.

given these factors, i confidently classify this text as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"Prove it. Got any credible scientific or sociological studies? NOPE, ya don't. Didn't think so.",0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the input text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the confrontational tone: ""prove it.""
2. the rhetorical question: ""got any credible scientific or sociological studies?""
3. the immediate self-answer: ""nope, ya don't.""
4. the dismissive conclusion: ""didn't think so.""

these elements combine to create a sarcastic tone, where the speaker is not genuinely asking for proof but rather implying that no such proof exists and mocking the idea that it could. the exaggerated certainty and the informal language (""ya don't"") further reinforce the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1
"Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive.

See above,0,"based on the current cues and the input ""see above,"" i can confidently provide a direct response without assigning a sarcasm label.

the input ""see above"" is not a statement that can be classified as sarcastic or not sarcastic in this context. it's a simple directive phrase that typically refers to previously provided information. however, in this case, there is no preceding information to refer to.

all the current cues consistently indicate that there is no previous context or text available to analyze or reference. they all express the same message: an apology for the lack of context and a request for the actual text to be provided.

therefore, the appropriate response would be to inform the user that there is no previous information to refer to, and request that they provide the specific text they want analyzed. this situation doesn't call for a sarcasm classification, as the phrase ""see above"" is neither sarcastic nor not sarcastic without any context.",0
"""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.",0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it begins with ""refuted?"" followed by ""o'rly?"" (a sarcastic way of saying ""oh, really?""), setting a mocking tone from the start.

2. the language is highly critical and dismissive, using terms like ""insane,"" ""retarded,"" and ""idiotic"" to describe the arguments it's addressing.

3. the author uses rhetorical questions and exaggerated statements to emphasize their disagreement with the points being made.

4. the overall tone is one of incredulity and mockery towards the arguments being presented against evolution.

5. the text employs sarcastic mimicry of the arguments it's criticizing, such as ""the whole idea that modifying dna, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.""

these elements combine to create a strongly sarcastic response to the anti-evolution arguments, making ""sarcastic"" the appropriate label for this text.",1
"The only person who can take away your sin is God. No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins, so get over it.",0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere statement about religious beliefs regarding sin and forgiveness. it doesn't contain any obvious irony or mockery that would indicate sarcasm. instead, it presents a straightforward, albeit somewhat blunt, theological perspective on the nature of sin and divine forgiveness. the contrasts highlighted in the cues (divine power vs. human limitation, hope vs. resignation) are present in the text and reinforce its non-sarcastic nature.",0
"And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists?

the text appears to be a genuine inquiry expressing frustration about the communication gap between scientists and laypersons. while there is a hint of exasperation in the tone, particularly in the rhetorical question about laypersons' intelligence, the overall message seems to be a sincere desire for better understanding and communication between the two groups. the author is genuinely questioning why there's a disconnect and suggesting that improved communication would be beneficial for both scientists and non-scientists. the examples given (putting on pants, eating, sleeping) are used to emphasize the common humanity of both groups, rather than to mock or create irony. therefore, this text does not appear to be sarcastic, but rather a straightforward expression of concern about an important issue in science communication.",0

the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. it begins with exaggerated laughter (bwahahahahhaah), which is often used to mock or ridicule.
2. it uses extreme language and capitalization for emphasis (e.g., five times, deliberately, endanger).
3. the content presents statistics and arguments in a hyperbolic manner, likely to mock opposing viewpoints.
4. it employs dismissive language (e.g., ""psht"") and name-calling (e.g., ""stupid, naive and arrogant"").
5. the overall tone is aggressive and mocking, typical of sarcastic rhetoric used to criticize opposing views on gun control.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the text is using sarcasm to make its point, rather than presenting a straightforward argument.",1

the text presents a skeptical view of certain studies, but it does so in a straightforward manner without employing sarcasm. the author is questioning the credibility of studies that might contradict the observed trend of decreased violent crime and murder rates despite increased gun ownership and concealed carry permits. while the tone is questioning and somewhat incredulous, it doesn't employ irony or mockery characteristic of sarcasm. the ""humm"" at the beginning indicates contemplation rather than sarcastic derision. therefore, this text is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"Actually, selection occurs by differential reproductive rates. What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others (obviously). Therefore, traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant.",0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward explanation of natural selection and how it works through differential reproductive rates. the content aligns directly with the common knowledge points provided, and the tone is informative rather than sarcastic. the use of ""actually"" at the beginning and ""obviously"" in parentheses doesn't indicate sarcasm in this context, but rather seems to be used for emphasis and clarification. the explanation is factual and consistent with basic principles of evolutionary biology, presenting the information in a clear, direct manner without any apparent irony or mockery.",0

It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.   11.	The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand. The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.

the text contains several indicators of sarcasm, particularly in its critical and mocking tone towards al gore and climate change advocacy. here are some key points that suggest sarcasm:

1. the opening line ""no. you're missing the point."" sets a confrontational and sarcastic tone.

2. the use of phrases like ""al wants you to think..."" and ""he wants you to fear..."" imply manipulation and deceit, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. the rhetorical questions about global warming on mars and jupiter are clearly meant to mock the idea of human-caused climate change on earth.

4. the author uses derogatory terms like ""shyster"" to describe al gore, indicating a strongly negative and sarcastic attitude.

5. the contrast between gore's warnings about sea level rise and his alleged purchase of a seaside condo is presented in a way that implies hypocrisy, another common target of sarcasm.

6. the overall tone is highly skeptical and dismissive of climate change concerns, using exaggeration and mockery to make its points.

while the text contains factual claims and criticisms, the overall presentation is heavily laden with sarcasm and ridicule, particularly towards al gore and the concept of human-caused climate change.",1
"Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.   Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours. I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate: ""Because you don't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded.""",0,"based on the content and tone of the input text, as well as the emotional words extracted, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a direct and serious critique of someone else's argument about the brain being a fundamental unit of life. the author uses strong language and emotional words to express disagreement and frustration, but does so in a straightforward manner. the text presents factual counterarguments and expresses genuine disapproval of the opposing view, rather than employing sarcasm or irony.",0
What other theories? Why mention them if you aren't going to explain them? You are actually on a board of education? I notice there was no mention of telling kids that there are other theories of gravity and that all of them have holes. Evolution is a more secure theory than gravity.,0,"sarcastic

this response is clearly sarcastic. the text uses rhetorical questions and a mocking tone to criticize the idea of presenting alternative theories to evolution in education. the final statement about evolution being ""a more secure theory than gravity"" is particularly sarcastic, as it's meant to highlight the absurdity of questioning the theory of evolution in schools when other well-established scientific theories like gravity aren't treated with the same skepticism. the overall tone and content strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic commentary on debates surrounding the teaching of evolution in schools.",1
"This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.   Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark.",0,"based on the content and context provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
the text appears to be a sincere explanation and critique of different views on natural selection and evolution. the author is presenting factual information about darwin's theory, contrasting it with pre-darwinian and anti-evolutionist views, and pointing out what they see as inconsistencies in some anti-evolutionist arguments. the tone is informative and analytical rather than sarcastic. the author is making a serious point about how some anti-evolutionists have recently adopted aspects of evolutionary theory to support their own beliefs, but this observation is presented as a factual critique rather than as sarcasm.",0
"So I have the choice between staying safe and then claiming insurance damages, or risking my life to kill a burglar and (likely) cause damage to my own property in the process?   Somehow, I'd rather stay safe. Better to lose my laptop than my life.",0,"based on the input text and the provided context, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the speaker is making a rational and sincere argument for prioritizing personal safety over confronting an intruder. the tone is straightforward and logical, presenting the options and explaining their preference without any ironic or sarcastic undertones. the statement ""better to lose my laptop than my life"" is a genuine expression of valuing one's life over material possessions, which aligns with the serious nature of the topic being discussed.",0
"Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say ""What might be the best...""   Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.",0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a sincere response to a challenge or question about pain measurement.
2. the tone is analytical and questioning, suggesting genuine engagement with the topic.
3. there's no apparent use of irony, exaggeration, or humor that would indicate sarcasm.
4. the language is direct and focused on logical arguments about the limitations of current knowledge and measurement capabilities.
5. the emotional words identified (challenge, not at a stage, insisting) suggest a debate or disagreement, but not in a sarcastic manner.

the text reads as a straightforward, albeit somewhat critical, response to a proposed challenge, arguing for a more nuanced approach given the current limitations in pain research and measurement. this serious engagement with the topic and lack of satirical elements supports classifying it as not sarcastic.",0
"You are getting to a more complicated area where ""mental existence"" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as ""self defense"" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before.",0,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a serious discussion about the complexities of the abortion debate, touching on philosophical concepts like mental existence, self-defense, and the value of human life. the author is expressing genuine concern about the implications of certain arguments in the abortion debate, particularly the idea that some lives might be valued above others. while the tone is critical, it doesn't employ irony or mockery characteristic of sarcasm. instead, it presents a thoughtful, albeit concerned, analysis of the ethical implications of certain pro-choice arguments.",0

"Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.",0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward, factual explanation of the legal responsibilities of police in the united states. it doesn't contain any obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory statements. the content aligns with actual legal precedents regarding police duties and liabilities. the tone is informative and matter-of-fact, consistent with providing a genuine explanation rather than employing sarcasm.",0
"I got an interesting tid bit for you:   http://www.2ampd.net/Articles/difiElitist.htm   First read the text. The anti-gun senator is noted for having the ONLY legal concealed gun in the city of San Francisco.   Also note as a person who carried a concealed gun and still keeps a .357 magnum for protection, that she should KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER, until your aming at your target.",0,"based on the information provided and the content of the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

### label: sarcastic

the text appears to be sarcastic due to the implied irony in the situation it describes. the author is pointing out the contradiction between an anti-gun senator having the only legal concealed gun permit in san francisco and keeping a .357 magnum for protection. the sarcasm is further emphasized by the comment about trigger discipline, which seems to mock the senator's gun ownership despite her anti-gun stance.

the tone of the text, particularly the phrase ""i got an interesting tid bit for you,"" also suggests a sarcastic or ironic intent in sharing this information. the author is likely using this example to criticize what they perceive as hypocrisy or inconsistency in the senator's position on gun control.",1
"They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be?

"Some apply logic, some do not. So much for contradictory thinking.   What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind? Hold the mythology, please.   from infidels.org -   The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ""the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference."" Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.   It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.   Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal.",0,"given the context and information provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the input text appears to be a serious discussion about the nature and limitations of logic. it references dictionary definitions, discusses the application of logic in reasoning, and provides examples of how logical thinking has been challenged or evolved over time. the tone is informative and questioning, rather than sarcastic. the text aligns closely with the extracted cues, further supporting that this is a genuine exploration of the concept of logic and its place in human understanding, rather than a sarcastic commentary.",0
"So, we are debating creation, yet you don't consider quoting the bible, the single most important original proponent of the creation account and to you, it doesn't qualify as a source for what is being discussed here? You say this and expect to be taken seriously?",0,"based on the current cues and the full context of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the rhetorical question at the end (""you say this and expect to be taken seriously?"") strongly implies disbelief and mockery.

2. the tone is incredulous, highlighting what the speaker sees as an absurd contradiction in the other person's argument.

3. the use of ""seriously"" in this context is ironic, further emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

4. the structure of the text, building up to the final rhetorical question, is a common sarcastic technique to underscore the perceived ridiculousness of the situation.

the emotional cues provided (debating, important, seriously) align with this interpretation, suggesting frustration and disbelief, which often accompany sarcasm in argumentative contexts.",1
"Didn't supersport openly admit he could not prove his own beliefs in divine creation?   For all his dishonesty, you have to admit he's more honest and forthcoming then Marc or AA have been.",0,"based on the input text and the provided emotional cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text uses contrast and irony, which are common in sarcasm. it begins by mentioning ""dishonesty"" but then immediately pivots to praising honesty and forthcomingness.

2. the comparison made (""more honest and forthcoming than marc or aa"") seems exaggerated and unlikely to be sincere, especially given the initial mention of dishonesty.

3. the question at the beginning appears to be rhetorical, setting up a sarcastic tone for the rest of the statement.

4. the use of ""for all his dishonesty"" followed by praise is a classic sarcastic structure, where something negative is immediately followed by an incongruent positive statement.

5. the emotional cues provided (dishonesty, honest, forthcoming) are all present in the text and used in a way that creates tension and irony, supporting a sarcastic interpretation.

given these factors, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to criticize or mock the subject's (supersport's) honesty or lack thereof, rather than genuinely praising it.",1
"Well sigma, which is more painful??   Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother.",0,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i believe the appropriate label for this text is:

sarcastic

the text uses extreme and emotionally charged language to make a point about abortion, comparing two gruesome scenarios in a way that seems designed to provoke a reaction rather than engage in sincere debate. the exaggerated nature of the comparisons and the accusatory tone towards people who ""dont really care about how the baby feels"" suggest that the author is using sarcasm to criticize pro-choice perspectives on abortion. the juxtaposition of such horrific scenarios with a casual opening ""well sigma, which is more painful??"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone of the message.",1
"Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.",0,"not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit frustrated, comment about the lengthy appeals process in death penalty cases. while the phrase ""till your ears bleed"" is hyperbolic, it's used to emphasize the speaker's perception of the tedious and prolonged nature of these appeals, rather than to convey sarcasm. the tone seems exasperated but sincere, without the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. therefore, based on the provided cues and context, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0
Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.,0,"not sarcastic

this response appears to be a genuine question and statement about agnosticism, followed by a sincere apology. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the text is straightforward, inquisitive, and shows a willingness to engage in thoughtful discussion about beliefs and openness to evidence. the apology at the end further reinforces the sincerity of the speaker. therefore, based on the content and context provided, this text is best labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0

the input text presents straightforward statistical information from two different polls about the percentage of atheists and non-religious people in the united states. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or any attempt at humor. the text is purely factual and informative, citing specific sources (gallup and cuny) and providing precise percentages. therefore, the correct label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0
"As is obvious, not all would.",0,"based on the input text and the limited context provided, i'll make a judgment on the label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
the phrase ""as is obvious"" is often used sarcastically to highlight something that is not actually obvious or to mock a simplistic viewpoint. the rest of the sentence, ""not all would,"" suggests a contrast or exception to an unstated assumption. without more context, the combination of these elements leans towards a sarcastic tone, where the speaker is likely challenging or mocking a generalization or oversimplification.

however, i want to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the surrounding conversation or topic, this judgment is made with limited certainty.",1
So once again you're steering away from the debate? I don't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post. You're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened. You're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation. I'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now.   [quote]The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\QUOTE]   It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
the text appears to be a direct, earnest criticism of someone's argumentative approach and biblical interpretation. while the tone is frustrated and confrontational, it doesn't employ irony or say the opposite of what is meant, which are key elements of sarcasm. the writer is being straightforward in their disagreement and accusations, expressing genuine frustration and skepticism rather than using sarcastic language to make their points.",0

Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.   Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine, thoughtful statement about the nature of existence before the big bang. it's presenting philosophical and scientific concepts without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the use of ""actually"" at the beginning suggests a correction or clarification of a common misconception, rather than a sarcastic remark. the addition of ""maybe"" at the end indicates uncertainty about these complex concepts, which is consistent with a sincere discussion of theoretical physics and cosmology.",0
"Hello there. The principle behind a pro-life Christian supporting the death penalty (I am one) is this: We are talking of innocent life.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the last sentence, ""doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold,"" is clearly sarcastic. it implies that the person being addressed is misrepresenting others' views or creating straw man arguments.

2. the tone is confrontational and dismissive, which is often associated with sarcastic responses in debates or arguments.

3. the phrase ""bizarre positions you decide other people should hold"" is a mocking way of criticizing the other person's argumentation style, implying they're attributing unreasonable views to others.

4. the overall structure of the comment, where it first presents factual information and then abruptly shifts to a sarcastic retort, is typical of sarcastic argumentation.

this sarcastic tone is used to criticize the reasoning or argumentation of the person being addressed, particularly in the context of a scientific debate about human evolution and cranial capacity.",1

the text is clearly sarcastic, using irony and exaggeration to make a point. the key indicators are:

1. the use of ""oxymoron"" to describe the combination of ""great"" and ""evangelist"", implying these terms are contradictory.

2. the comparison to ""military intelligence"", which is a classic example often used sarcastically to suggest a contradiction in terms.

3. the overall tone is critical and mocking, especially with the phrase ""as i stated before...you left too many other questions unanswered"", which implies frustration or derision towards the subject being discussed.

2. the blunt disagreement ""no they didn't"" followed by the rhetorical question suggests frustration and implies the speaker thinks the other person is ignorant.
3. the rhetorical question ""have you ever actually taken a biology course?"" is likely not a genuine inquiry, but rather a sarcastic way to imply the other person lacks knowledge.

"Actually just as many atheist help the needy.   Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need",0,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text presents a serious, detailed argument countering the notion that only religious people engage in charitable giving.

2. it provides specific examples of atheist philanthropists and organizations to support its claims.

3. the tone is direct and informative, aimed at educating the reader rather than employing sarcasm.

4. while there are a few instances of mild sarcasm (e.g., ""oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?""), the overall text is not sarcastic in nature.

5. the author is making a genuine effort to present information and challenge misconceptions about atheists and charitable giving.

therefore, while the text has occasional moments of pointed commentary, it is primarily a sincere argument and does not qualify as sarcastic overall.",0
"believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless",0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward, rational explanation of the relationship between science and religion regarding the existence of god. it presents a balanced view, highlighting common ground between scientific and religious perspectives rather than opposing them. the tone is neutral and analytical, without any apparent irony or sarcasm. 

key points that support this assessment:

1. the text explicitly states that science is not anti-religious or hostile towards religion.
2. it presents a nuanced view of both scientific and religious approaches to belief in god.
3. the language used is matter-of-fact and explanatory, without exaggeration or mockery.
4. the text acknowledges the role of faith in both scientific and religious contexts without belittling either perspective.
5. the conclusion summarizes the main point in a straightforward manner, reinforcing the neutral tone of the entire passage.

given these factors, i can confidently label this text as ""not sarcastic.""",0
Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.,0,"based on the provided context and cues, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic undertones. the speaker is using rhetorical questions and pointed language to emphasize their belief that newton did not actually find empirical evidence of god. the phrase ""do you mean someone who was wrong?"" is particularly indicative of sarcasm, implying that the person they're addressing is mistaken in their assertions about newton. the final sentence, ""i suspect that you can't,"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone by suggesting that the other person is unable to provide the requested evidence, which the speaker seems to believe does not exist.",1
"By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course, which is different to imprisonment of the criminal.",0,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of ""of course"" which implies a mock agreement with an absurd interpretation.
2. the stark contrast between ""killing the innocent"" and ""imprisonment of the criminal,"" highlighting the disproportionate and unjust nature of the first action.
3. the tone is biting and critical, using irony to point out the extreme difference between these two actions.

the sarcasm serves to criticize and draw attention to the severity and injustice of ""removing"" (euphemism for killing) innocent people, compared to the more appropriate punishment of imprisoning actual criminals. the author is using sarcasm to express disapproval and highlight the absurdity of equating these two very different actions.",1
So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.,0,"sarcastic

this input text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using rhetorical questions and exaggerated language to criticize and mock someone else's argument. the tone is incredulous and the phrasing implies that the opposing claim is absurd. 

key elements that indicate sarcasm:

1. the opening ""so you're actually claiming..."" is a classic sarcastic setup, expressing disbelief at the supposed claim.

2. the use of ""even if..."" to present a hypothetical that still wouldn't justify the conclusion being criticized.

3. phrases like ""huge and unjustified leap in logic"" directly call out the perceived absurdity of the argument.

4. the overall structure of presenting the opposing view in an exaggerated manner to highlight its flaws is a common sarcastic technique.

therefore, based on the tone, structure, and word choice, this text is clearly sarcastic in nature.",1
"It depends on the particular situation. Some adoption agencies ask about it, and some don't. Most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions. Some adoptive gay parents are out about it, and some keep it quiet.   There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, ""I am not homosexual."" Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely. They have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents. In the case of a couple, their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt. No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans.",0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward, informative explanation of various adoption policies and practices, particularly as they relate to gay individuals and couples. while some of the information presented might be controversial or surprising (such as weight requirements for adoptive parents in china), the tone remains factual and neutral throughout. there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking language. the author simply presents the information without commentary or emotional bias, making this a clear example of non-sarcastic text.",0
"Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.",0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward, factual explanation of evolutionary processes. it describes the step-by-step development of complex biological systems through modifications of existing structures, mutations, and natural selection. the tone is informative and matter-of-fact, without any apparent sarcasm or irony. the author is presenting scientific concepts and offering to provide further information, which is consistent with a genuine, non-sarcastic discussion of the topic.",0
"(Note the key word ""also,"" which admits that it's human).   As for the rest, This is more of the sort of ""defensive rationalization"" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own ""brilliance"" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a ""parasite"" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human.   However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.   Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk.   Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.   This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions.",0,"based on my analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

this text appears to be a serious, earnest argument against abortion. the author is making a detailed case for why they believe a fetus should not be considered a parasite and why both parents bear responsibility for it. the language and tone are passionate and argumentative, but there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony. the text is consistent with the topic summary provided in the cues, presenting a straightforward anti-abortion stance using logical arguments and legal concepts. the author seems to be genuinely expressing their viewpoint rather than employing sarcasm to make their point.",0

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine inquiry seeking more information and citations about claims made against carl baugh. the tone is inquisitive and slightly skeptical, but not sarcastic. the parenthetical comment about feeling special for being asked to look up a book adds a touch of light-heartedness, but it doesn't change the overall sincere nature of the request for information.",0
"You're right, I think he has made such comments. Sorry. I think he's wrong and went too far.",0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

explanation:
the text appears to be a sincere acknowledgment and apology. the speaker is agreeing with someone else's point (""you're right""), admitting their own mistake (""sorry""), and expressing their opinion about a third party's actions (""i think he's wrong and went too far""). the use of words like ""sorry"" and the straightforward expression of disagreement suggest that this is a genuine statement rather than a sarcastic one. the emotional cues provided (sorry, wrong, too far) align with the content of the text and support a non-sarcastic interpretation.",0

label: not sarcastic

the input text ""we agree! excellent!"" appears to be a genuine expression of agreement and approval. there are no contextual clues or indicators of sarcasm present. the exclamations are straightforward positive statements without any underlying contradictions or irony that would suggest sarcastic intent. the emotional words extracted (""agree"" and ""excellent"") are consistently positive, and there's no contrast or unexpected juxtaposition that might hint at sarcasm. therefore, it's most likely that this statement is meant to be taken at face value as a sincere expression of agreement and enthusiasm.",0

If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" would they and with positive critiques too.

the text appears to be a serious argument presenting contentious views on mental health issues in the gay community compared to the heterosexual community. it references statistics, professional organizations, and prominent figures to support its claims. the tone is direct and argumentative rather than employing irony or humor typical of sarcasm. while the views expressed may be controversial, the text itself does not exhibit characteristics of sarcasm.",0

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing. There was nobody there at all, no human anyway.",0,"based on the content and emotional language used in this text, i would classify it as:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere and earnest account of personal religious experiences and beliefs. the author describes multiple instances of what they perceive as miraculous interventions and supernatural events, expressing strong conviction in their faith. the language used is emotional and passionate, but not ironic or mocking, which are typical hallmarks of sarcasm. 

the author speaks of healing prayers, angelic interventions, and spiritual experiences with genuine belief and fervor. they also acknowledge the skepticism others might have while firmly standing by their own experiences. this level of detail and personal investment in the narrative suggests the author is being straightforward about their beliefs rather than employing sarcasm.

the emotional words extracted from the text further support this classification, as they reflect both positive religious sentiments (miracle, healing, love, grace) and descriptions of challenging situations (violent, murder, trouble) that the author claims to have overcome through faith.

given these factors, i am confident in classifying this text as ""not sarcastic.""",0

the text appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration and criticism towards an unclear concept or statement. while the language is strong and dismissive, it doesn't exhibit the hallmarks of sarcasm such as irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. instead, it's a direct and genuine critique of something the speaker finds confusing and unhelpful.",0
"And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of ""atheism"" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you.",0,"based on the input text and the extracted emotional cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the use of ""failing miserably"" is an exaggerated criticism.
2. the term ""asinine"" to describe the person's definition is harsh and mocking.
3. the overall tone is condescending and dismissive, particularly with the final sentence implying even those who might be expected to agree (christians) would not.

these elements, combined with the strong negative emotions conveyed, strongly indicate that the statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward criticism.",1

"Oh, he doesn't want abortion, huh? If you take the Old Testament to be true, you just lied here.   Let's look, shall we?",0,"based on the input text and the current cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear markers of sarcasm, including:

1. the rhetorical question ""oh, he doesn't want abortion, huh?"" which implies skepticism or mockery.
2. the challenging tone in ""if you take the old testament to be true, you just lied here.""
3. the exaggerated invitation ""let's look, shall we?"" which suggests the speaker is about to present contradictory evidence.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic tone that questions and mocks the stance of someone who opposes abortion while claiming to adhere to old testament teachings. the speaker is using irony to highlight perceived inconsistencies in this position.",1

I'm not surprised.   That's a typical response when someone calls your bluff.   Waxy,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the phrase ""i'm not surprised"" often carries a sarcastic tone, especially when followed by commentary on someone's behavior.

2. the use of ""typical"" suggests a critical or dismissive attitude towards the response being described.

3. the mention of ""calling your bluff"" implies a confrontational situation where sarcasm is often employed.

4. the seemingly unrelated word ""waxy"" at the end adds an element of absurdity or non-sequitur, which is a common technique in sarcastic comments to emphasize the speaker's disdain or mockery.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their disapproval or criticism of someone's predictable behavior when confronted.",1

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it uses exaggeration and hyperbole to make its point, such as imagining elaborate fashion and economic opportunities around open carry.

2. the tone is mock-enthusiastic, proposing absurd scenarios (like needing a specific outfit to get a date) to ridicule opposing viewpoints.

3. it employs irony, particularly in comparing gun-carrying to wearing revealing clothing (""it doesn't bother you to watch scantily clad women...or men"").

4. the text uses derogatory language towards those with opposing views (""brady cowards""), which is often a feature of sarcastic political commentary.

5. the overall structure of the text presents seemingly positive scenarios about open carry, but the exaggerated nature of these scenarios implies a critical undertone, suggesting that the author is actually mocking arguments against open carry.

while the author appears to be pro-gun rights, they are using sarcasm as a rhetorical device to criticize gun control advocates and dramatize what they see as the benefits and normalcy of open carry. the sarcastic tone serves to underscore the author's actual beliefs while ridiculing opposing viewpoints.",1

the text is not sarcastic, but rather a sincere cautionary message about the potential misinterpretation of scientific terminology. the author is genuinely advising readers to be careful about taking scientific names or terms at face value, using examples like ""junk dna"" and ""gill slits"" to illustrate how these labels can be misleading. the tone is informative and slightly critical of overreliance on terminology in evolutionary biology, but it does not employ sarcasm to convey its message.",0

while the statement uses political jargon and has a slightly cynical tone, it doesn't display clear markers of sarcasm. the phrase ""pork tacked onto the original bill"" is a straightforward use of political terminology to describe additional, often unnecessary, provisions added to legislation. the speaker appears to be providing a factual, albeit critical, explanation rather than employing sarcasm. the directness of the statement and the absence of exaggeration or irony typical of sarcastic remarks support classifying this as not sarcastic.",0

the statement is a straightforward clarification about which specific concept of creation the speaker is referring to. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or any form of figurative language that would suggest a sarcastic intent. the speaker is simply distinguishing between the literal 7-day creation account from the bible and other theories of divine creation that might be compatible with scientific explanations like the big bang. this appears to be a genuine attempt to clarify their point of reference, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.",0

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere, though somewhat informal, explanation and argument about evolution, intelligent design, and the limitations of science in disproving the existence of god. the author is presenting their views straightforwardly, without employing sarcasm or irony. they are addressing misconceptions about evolution, discussing the challenges of using design flaws as evidence against god's existence, and explaining why science cannot definitively disprove god. the language and arguments used are direct and meant to be taken at face value, rather than conveying a sarcastic or mocking tone.",0
"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.",0,"not sarcastic

the input text appears to be a sincere and detailed explanation of the author's views on morality. the content aligns with the key points extracted, and there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm. the author is engaging in a thoughtful discussion about the basis of their moral code, referencing philosophical concepts and contrasting their approach with religious-based morality. the tone is earnest and explanatory, demonstrating a genuine attempt to clarify their position and reasoning. therefore, the appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0
"And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.   Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.",0,"not sarcastic

the text presents factual information about quantum physics and its counterintuitive nature, followed by a cautionary statement about applying macro-world experiences to quantum phenomena. the tone is informative and serious, without any indicators of sarcasm or irony. the content is consistent with established scientific understanding of quantum physics and its implications. therefore, this text is clearly not sarcastic.",0
"Well, that just struck a chord with me. People of both sides say, “We got the facts! The facts support our side!?but it isn't about the facts but how we react to them.",0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine reflection on the nature of debates and disagreements. the speaker is making a sincere observation about how people from different sides of an argument claim to have facts supporting their position, but the real issue lies in how people interpret and react to those facts. the phrase ""well, that just struck a chord with me"" indicates a genuine emotional response to this realization, rather than a sarcastic comment. the tone and content align with the cues provided, suggesting a thoughtful consideration of the topic rather than a sarcastic remark.",0
"Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic.",0,"based on the input text and the limited context provided, i believe i can make a reasonable judgment about the sarcasm in this statement.

label: sarcastic

the text demonstrates clear sarcastic elements:

1. the rhetorical question ""oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts?"" implies the opposite of what it's asking, suggesting the person was indeed talking about evolution.

2. the follow-up question ""then why are they posted on the c vs e board?"" further emphasizes the sarcasm by pointing out an apparent contradiction.

3. the final statement ""please, that's just pathetic"" is a dismissive comment that reinforces the sarcastic tone of the entire message.

the speaker is using irony to mock or criticize the other person's apparent attempt to deny discussing evolution in a forum dedicated to evolution debates (likely creationism vs. evolution, given the ""c vs e"" reference). this combination of rhetorical questions and dismissive language is a common structure for sarcastic comments in online discussions.",1
A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic because:

1. the phrase ""a taste of what could be our future"" is often used sarcastically to criticize or mock a potential outcome.

2. the cues indicate that the context involves criticism of left-leaning policies, which aligns with a sarcastic interpretation.

3. the dramatic phrasing ""if the left has its way"" suggests an exaggerated or mocking tone typical of sarcasm.

4. the statement doesn't provide specific details, which is common in sarcastic generalizations.

the sarcasm here appears to be used to express disapproval or mockery of perceived negative consequences of left-leaning policies, rather than a literal prediction of the future.",1
"Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have.",0,"based on the context provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the rhetorical question at the beginning suggests a mocking tone.
2. the use of ""a bit better"" is likely understated for effect.
3. the contrast between acknowledging the skeptic's disparaging remarks and then pointing out their failure to address the actual examples implies criticism through irony.
4. the phrase ""well documented examples"" appears to be used sarcastically, especially given the context of a debate about creationism.

the overall tone and structure of the comment indicate that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize the skeptic's debate tactics and indirectly support the position that creationism involves falsehoods.",1

Certainly it does.,0,"based on the given cues and the input text ""certainly it does."", i cannot confidently assign a label of 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. the phrase is too brief and lacks context to determine if it's meant sarcastically or not. without more information about the conversation or the tone in which it was said, it's impossible to accurately judge whether sarcasm is present. the statement could be a genuine affirmation or a sarcastic response depending on the context, which is not provided. therefore, i cannot reliably assign a label in this case.",0

I think you overestimate how big of a ""moral issue"" this really is for most people.   Waxy",0,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine, earnest response challenging claims made by another person (jyoshu) about same-sex marriage and the canadian government's stance on free speech and religious freedom. the author is asking for evidence to support the claims and offering their own perspective based on personal experience. the language is direct and argumentative, but it doesn't exhibit the hallmarks of sarcasm such as irony or mocking tone. instead, it's a straightforward rebuttal and request for proof, which is characteristic of sincere debate rather than sarcastic commentary.",0

"Actually, Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong. The fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant.",0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the use of ""actually"" at the beginning sets a contrarian tone.
2. the statement is overly definitive and absolute (""utterly wrong""), which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
3. the dismissive nature of the last sentence, stating that the other party's recognition is ""irrelevant,"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone.
4. the context provided indicates an ongoing argument where the speaker believes they have conclusive evidence, yet expresses this in a mocking rather than straightforward manner.

these factors combined strongly suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize or mock the other party's position in the argument.",1

Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.",0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine, thoughtful commentary on the gaia theory and related concepts. while the author expresses some skepticism and criticism, the overall tone is one of genuine interest and consideration rather than sarcasm. the contrasts in the text reflect a balanced perspective, weighing both the fascinating aspects and potential shortcomings of the theory. the final comparison to creationism seems to be a sincere assessment rather than a sarcastic jab. therefore, based on the content and tone, this text is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0

sarcastic

the text employs sarcasm to critique arguments about abortion rights and bodily autonomy. it uses exaggerated analogies and deliberately absurd comparisons (like equating pregnancy with inviting a stranger for dinner) to highlight perceived flaws in pro-choice arguments. the emotional contrasts and complex ethical dilemmas presented in the cues are evident in the text, supporting the sarcastic tone. the author is not sincerely proposing these ideas, but rather using them to satirize and challenge certain pro-choice positions.",1
"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.   4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html   Here is a time line of hominid species   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html   Evolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well ""evolved"" depending on it's environment etc.   A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp.

Humans just like to think so.",0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward, informative explanation of various aspects of evolution and human ancestry. it aligns well with the extracted common knowledge points and doesn't contain any apparent sarcastic elements. the author is providing factual information and explanations about evolutionary concepts, which match the current cues and general scientific understanding of the topic.",0
"A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S.",0,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it begins with a dismissive and confrontational tone (""a slimey claim you cannot support as usual""), which is often used in sarcastic responses.

2. the statement contradicts itself, which is a common sarcastic technique. it first says the u.s. is ""far down the list"" among developed nations (implying higher crime rates), but then claims that ""'other' nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the u.s.""

3. the reference to the information being posted ""at least 5 times"" on the board seems exaggerated and potentially mocking, another hallmark of sarcasm.

4. the use of quotation marks around 'other' suggests a mocking or skeptical tone towards the notion of these other nations.

the overall tone and contradictory nature of the statement strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic response, likely aimed at criticizing or mocking someone else's claims about crime rates in the u.s. compared to other nations.",1

You're working at the wrong end of the problem. We need young to survive. It's the old that are expendable.,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i would assign the following label:

sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be sarcastic because it presents a controversial and ethically questionable view about the value of human life based on age in a matter-of-fact tone. the blunt assertion that older people are ""expendable"" while young people are needed for survival is likely meant to provoke a reaction or highlight the absurdity of such thinking, rather than being a genuinely held belief. the casual way of discussing such a sensitive topic (""you're working at the wrong end of the problem"") adds to the sarcastic tone, making light of a serious ethical issue.",1

this statement is sarcastic because it uses a rhetorical question to point out a logical inconsistency in arguments against gun control. the speaker is implying that stricter gun laws do, in fact, affect criminal behavior by citing the example of the uk, which has both strict gun laws and low rates of criminal gun use. the sarcasm lies in framing this as a question, as if inviting gun law opponents to explain something that contradicts their stance.",1

"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see.",0,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

the text appears to be a genuine and earnest discussion of a philosophical argument for the existence of god. the author is engaging seriously with the topic, providing explanations and clarifications about the ontological argument. while there is some skepticism expressed (e.g., ""yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless""), this is presented as part of a thoughtful analysis rather than as sarcasm. the final ""hmmm...."" suggests contemplation rather than mockery. overall, the tone is one of sincere intellectual engagement rather than sarcasm.",0
"Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one.",0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. it opens with a rhetorical question (""notice the double-standard here?""), which is often used to introduce sarcastic commentary.

2. the author points out a perceived hypocrisy, contrasting accusations of harassment with actions that could be seen as promoting harassment.

3. the final sentence ""i can't wait to see the backlash from this one"" is likely meant ironically, as the author probably doesn't actually look forward to conflict but is rather predicting it with a mix of frustration and dark humor.

4. the emotional words identified (accuses, harassment, backlash) and the overall confrontational tone support the sarcastic interpretation.

sarcastic

the text contains clear elements of sarcasm, particularly in the statement ""you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post."" this is a sarcastic jab at the other person's language skills, using wordplay to equate poor grammar with actual murder. the overall tone is confrontational and mocking, which are common characteristics of sarcastic discourse, especially in online debates.",1

this text appears to be a straightforward clarification of a scientific concept and how it's being discussed. there's no evident sarcasm or irony present. the author is making a sincere effort to correct a misunderstanding and accurately represent scientific views. the tone is informative and direct, without any apparent attempt at humor or mockery that would indicate sarcasm. therefore, based on the content and context provided, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic"".",0
"Banning abortion is a tool with which to punish women you deem promiscuous or immoral and recreate through a police state a mythical golden age of christian virtue, got you.   The rest is just a cover story in the same way biblical creationists who want their religion brought into the school system advocate ""intelligent design"".   They call it ""lying for baby Jesus"".",0,"based on the emotional cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear hallmarks of sarcasm, including:

1. exaggerated statements about punishing women and creating a ""police state""
2. references to a ""mythical golden age"" of christian virtue, implying skepticism
3. comparing anti-abortion arguments to ""intelligent design"" advocates, suggesting dishonesty
4. the phrase ""lying for baby jesus"" is particularly sarcastic, mocking religious justifications

"So let me get this straight - you admit that you are wrong, and you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct?   How about we both simply agree that you were wrong and move on.",0,"based on the emotional contrasts and linguistic cues present in the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the rhetorical question ""so let me get this straight..."" is a common sarcastic opener, setting up an exaggerated or absurd scenario.

2. the juxtaposition of ""you admit that you are wrong"" with ""you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct"" highlights the perceived absurdity of the situation, a key element of sarcasm.

3. the follow-up suggestion ""how about we both simply agree that you were wrong and move on"" uses a seemingly reasonable tone to emphasize the speaker's frustration and the perceived ridiculousness of the other person's stance.

the emotional contrasts of frustration vs. conciliation and accusation vs. compromise further support the sarcastic tone, as the speaker oscillates between pointing out the absurdity and proposing a resolution, all while maintaining an underlying critical stance.",1
"Oh sorry, I didn't understand what you were asking.   Ok, what I think happened {Like Tasyfish hinted at} was that Moses recorded what god told him or Genesis 1 because it is in more detail, and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah, in Oral history, so it would differ slightly, but that's becaue of man's error, not God's.",0,"not sarcastic

the text does not exhibit any clear signs of sarcasm. it appears to be a genuine attempt to explain a perspective on the differences between genesis 1 and genesis 2 in the bible. the speaker starts with an apology for not understanding initially, which seems sincere, and then proceeds to offer their interpretation. the tone is explanatory and speculative rather than sarcastic or mocking. the content and style of communication align with a straightforward, non-sarcastic response to a previous question or discussion about biblical texts.",0
"A more precise term would be ""broaden,"" since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, ""diluted"" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only ""change"" would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only ""change"" in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.   The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.",0,"not sarcastic

this text is a straightforward, logical argument about the terminology and implications of expanding marriage rights to include same-sex couples. the author presents a reasoned case for why ""broaden"" is a more accurate term than ""dilute"" when discussing this change. 

the tone is analytical and informative, without any irony, exaggeration, or mocking elements that would typically characterize sarcasm. the author is making a sincere effort to clarify the nature of the proposed change to marriage laws, emphasizing that it doesn't alter existing rights but rather expands who can access those rights.

the language used is precise and aimed at explaining a concept clearly, which is inconsistent with sarcastic intent. therefore, this text can be confidently labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0

2. the capitalization of ""this"" for emphasis adds to the sarcastic delivery.

Through religion, televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity.

"But we certainly have the right to evict such persons.   But then, regardless, the embryo is not a person.",0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward statement of opinion on a controversial topic, likely abortion or embryonic rights. while the topic is emotionally charged, the language used is direct and matter-of-fact, without any apparent irony or sarcastic undertones. the speaker is presenting their viewpoint plainly, arguing that there is a right to ""evict"" certain persons (possibly referring to abortion) and asserting that an embryo is not considered a person. these are contentious claims, but they are presented in a direct manner that doesn't suggest sarcasm.",0
"Well it could mean simple instinct, and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains.

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward, analytical response to a discussion about intelligence in living organisms. it presents a critical view of a particular perspective (attributed to ""eam"") in a direct and factual manner, without employing sarcasm or irony. the author is making a serious argument against attributing intelligence to all living things, and there are no signs of exaggeration, mockery, or humorous contradictions that would typically indicate sarcasm.",0

2. the speaker is responding to something that wasn't said, as indicated in the context cues.
3. there's an underlying criticism or frustration expressed through the suggestion of a missed opportunity for agreement.

this text appears to be a genuine expression of the author's views on safety precautions, including fire extinguishers, seat belts, and carrying firearms. the tone is consistent and sincere throughout, drawing parallels between different safety measures. the use of phrases like ""pray i'll never need it"" and ""god bless"" further reinforces the earnest nature of the statement. there are no indicators of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the author is expressing a straightforward belief in being prepared for potential emergencies, even if they hope never to encounter them.",0
Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the exclamation ""oh what a shame!"" followed by ""especially if it's true!"" suggests an exaggerated, insincere expression of disappointment.

2. the rhetorical question at the end implies skepticism about the notion that intelligent design (id) theory is not evidence-based.

4. the contrast between expressing disappointment and then immediately questioning the premise creates a sarcastic undertone.

this combination of factors strongly indicates that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize or mock the idea that id theory lacks an evidence-based foundation.",1
"Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem.

What school are you at?",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text uses sarcasm to make a point about gun control policies on university campuses. the author employs exaggerated logic and a mocking tone to criticize the idea that the presence of weapons inherently increases danger. the statement about the ""murder rate"" at their house being zero is particularly sarcastic, using personal anecdotal evidence in an absurd way to counter arguments about gun safety on campuses. this sarcastic approach is used to challenge the perspective that guns on campus are inherently dangerous.",1

not sarcastic

"Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells ""tuned"" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can ""figure out"" what wavelength is entering our eyes.   http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm   Does this dispell your confusion?   Edit:   And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye.",1,not sarcastic,0

60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

2. the cues indicate that the text is primarily stating factual information about poll numbers.

therefore, the text seems to be a sincere statement and question about public opinion data, without any apparent sarcastic intent.",0
Shh shhh it's ok mellow mellow mellow. Relax you have managed to go from legalizing gay marriage to a collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man's ability to reason and govern himself in two paragraphs.   Maybe gay people would like to enjoy some of the happiness you get from your marriage and same as you that happiness is worth the oppressiveness incurred as a result.   You may have more in common with gay people than you think.,1,"based on the input text and the extracted emotional cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the opening ""shh shhh it's ok mellow mellow mellow"" is exaggerated and condescending, setting a sarcastic tone.

2. the author sarcastically exaggerates the consequences of legalizing gay marriage, implying a ""collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man's ability to reason and govern himself.""

3. the contrast between the extreme negative consequences mentioned and the simple desire for happiness highlights the sarcastic intent.

4. the final statement about having more in common with gay people than the addressee thinks is a sarcastic jab at the perceived narrow-mindedness of the person being addressed.

the mix of calming words (mellow, relax) with extreme negative outcomes (collapse, downfall) in the emotional cues further supports the sarcastic nature of the text. the author is using these contrasts to mock the exaggerated fears about gay marriage.",1

"Chalk it up to the fact that -- although not all the time -- a good part of the time, the same people are pretty anti-anything education. We shouldn't expect them to argue positions that make sense.",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

the text uses a sardonic tone to criticize people who are anti-education, implying that their arguments often don't make sense. the sarcasm is evident in the final sentence: ""we shouldn't expect them to argue positions that make sense."" this statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a biting commentary on the perceived illogical nature of anti-education arguments. the overall tone and content align with the cues provided, particularly the idea that anti-education stances are often not well-reasoned, making this a clear example of sarcasm.",1
"Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they, termites could assure that if properly used. After 40 days and more they would be ravenous.",1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text uses a speculative and somewhat absurd scenario (termites destroying noah's ark) to explain why the ark hasn't been found.
2. the tone is casual and slightly mocking, especially with the phrase ""if properly used"" when referring to termites, as if they were a tool.
3. the comment about termites being ""ravenous"" after 40 days adds to the exaggerated nature of the statement, contributing to the sarcastic tone.
4. the overall context suggests a skeptical or humorous take on the biblical story, rather than a serious discussion.

while the sarcasm is subtle, the combination of these elements points towards a sarcastic interpretation of the biblical narrative and the search for noah's ark.",1
"Well, that's because all those things happened during the Age of Law (the god of swift and harsh justice bit), whereas now we're in the Age of Grace (the god is all-forgiving bit), so . . . . er . . . hang on a minute.",1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. the speaker starts by seemingly attempting to explain the difference between the ""age of law"" and the ""age of grace"" in christian theology, but then trails off with ""er... hang on a minute."" this ending implies that the speaker has realized a contradiction or inconsistency in the explanation they were trying to give.

the sarcasm lies in the way the speaker initially presents a confident explanation of the theological concepts, only to undermine it at the end. this suggests that the speaker is actually pointing out the perceived inconsistency in the idea of god being both harshly judgmental (in the old testament) and all-forgiving (in the new testament).

the ""hang on a minute"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it shows the speaker pretending to suddenly realize the contradiction in what they're saying, when in fact they likely intended to highlight this contradiction all along.",1

the text appears to be a direct and serious response to accusations and misunderstandings. the speaker is clarifying their position, explaining the content of their previous post, and addressing misconceptions about their beliefs and intentions. the tone is straightforward and somewhat frustrated, but there are no indicators of sarcasm. the speaker is genuinely trying to correct misinterpretations and defend their stance, which is characteristic of non-sarcastic communication in a debate or argument context.",0
oh brother.. so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder.   this is rediculous.,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text uses exaggeration and an absurd example (legalizing murder) to criticize the idea of making policy changes based on minority opinions. the phrase ""oh brother"" and the misspelling of ""ridiculous"" as ""rediculous"" further reinforce the sarcastic tone. the comment is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to mock and express disagreement with the concept being discussed.",1
Mongoloid? Is this 1937?,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the input ""mongoloid? is this 1937?"" is indeed sarcastic. the speaker is using a rhetorical question to express criticism and disbelief at the use of an outdated and offensive term. by referencing the year 1937, they're implying that such language is extremely outdated and inappropriate in modern times. this use of exaggeration and historical reference to make a point about present-day language use is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1

"BREAKING NEWS: SHOOTING IN DALLAS OFFICE TOWER - CTnow   Ah, the good old gun-crazy US of A.",1,"given the input text and the extracted topic, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

explanation: the text contains two parts:
1. a factual news headline about a shooting incident in dallas.
2. a comment ""ah, the good old gun-crazy us of a.""

the second part is clearly sarcastic. it uses a mocking tone to criticize the frequency of gun violence in the united states. the phrase ""good old"" is often used sarcastically to highlight negative aspects of something, and calling the us ""gun-crazy"" is a critical commentary on the country's relationship with firearms.

this combination of a serious news headline with a sarcastic comment about gun violence is a clear indicator of sarcasm, particularly as a commentary on the recurring nature of such incidents in the united states.",1
So god is unnatural?,1,"based on the available cues and the input text, i will assign a label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
the question ""so god is unnatural?"" appears to be a straightforward philosophical or theological inquiry. the cues suggest that this is likely part of a serious discussion about the nature of god, rather than a sarcastic statement. there's no clear indication of irony, mockery, or exaggeration that would typically characterize sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a genuine question seeking clarification or challenging a concept, which is common in philosophical debates.",0
So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.

New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using exaggerated scenarios and rhetorical questions to criticize and mock an opposing viewpoint on gun control. the sarcasm is particularly evident in:

1. the extreme example of allowing a 10-year-old to buy an uzi and carry it into sensitive locations.
2. the use of ""wow"" to express mock amazement.
3. the seemingly agreeable statement about the logic being ""perfect,"" followed by a contradiction that undermines that logic.
4. the exaggerated list of criminals at the end, emphasizing the ongoing nature of crime.

the tone is heavily satirical, using hyperbole to point out perceived flaws in the argument being critiqued. this is a classic example of using sarcasm to make a point in a debate about a serious topic.",1
"Is that what you said right before they started banning assault weapons? 'Oh, let's just see what Sarah Brady wants to do?' Obviously, you're gullible.

And again, read this slower this time (if that helps) 'On the other hand, not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned.'",1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the tone is confrontational and mocking, using phrases like ""obviously, you're gullible"" and sarcastically calling the person a ""brainiac."" the use of ""beloved un"" is also sarcastic, implying the opposite. the overall structure, including rhetorical questions and condescending instructions to ""read this slower,"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone. the content appears to be criticizing someone's stance on gun control and their trust in certain organizations, but does so through heavy sarcasm rather than straightforward argument.",1
"What quaint illogic. Only people who marry can get divorced, so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates. If anything, a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than ""normal"".",1,"based on the provided cues and context, as well as analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the opening phrase ""what quaint illogic"" is a sardonic way of calling the unstated argument foolish or naive.

2. the tone is mocking, using terms like ""quaint"" to belittle the logic being criticized.

3. the author uses irony to point out the flawed reasoning, explaining how the purported relationship between marriage and divorce rates actually implies the opposite of what's being claimed.

4. the quotation marks around ""normal"" at the end suggest a skeptical or mocking attitude towards the concept.

the combination of mocking language, irony, and the deliberate deconstruction of the flawed logic all strongly indicate that this text is sarcastic in nature.",1

this text is clearly sarcastic. the use of exaggerated language, capitalization for emphasis (""proved""), and the feigned surprise and admiration are all hallmarks of sarcasm. the speaker is not genuinely impressed by the claim of disproving the big bang theory, but rather mocking the idea that someone could casually refute such a well-established scientific concept. the request for a reference to the article at the end is particularly sarcastic, as the speaker clearly doesn't believe such an article exists.",1

the text appears to be a genuine, albeit emotional, series of questions. the author is using strong language and emotional cues to express concern and outrage about a serious situation in india. the questions seem rhetorical but sincere, aimed at emphasizing the gravity of the events and the potential public reaction. the use of words like ""upset,"" ""violently murdered,"" and phrases like ""seeking changes"" and ""better prepared"" align with the extracted emotional cues and indicate a serious tone rather than a sarcastic one. the author seems to be genuinely questioning or challenging someone's understanding or portrayal of the situation in india, not employing sarcasm.",0
"My first line of defense for up to 300 yards is an M4 (specops m16) flattop with an ACOG scope and tritium backup sights, 14.5 barrel with a 1/7 twist with mccluek (sp) muzzle brake to make it the legal 16 inches. foward pistol grip and a surefire light mounted to my knights RASII. I keep 45 grains in the clips so they frange and not penatrate walls. I keep a second clip with 77gr noslers in a mag-cinched clip for longer range shots. I use a long range Shephered scope on my .308 chambered m14 for shotting zombies out to 1000 yards. And to compliment my defensive ability I keep a romanian AK in my bugout bag with a surefire light and an OKO red dot scope for quick egress when reliability is of most importance and close range firefight is likley. (this in not to mention the plethora of pistoles and handguns I keep for home defense also). THe m4 is 1.5 MOA, The M14 (m1a) is sub MOA, and the AK is a typical 3-4moa. BTW. I have had military and civilian training in all of these weapons   I also keep a well trained Caucasian Mountain dog roaming the house at night so if anyone where to make it inside I doubt there would be anything left of him by the time I got there...   Preparedness my friends...   Now VoR probably keeps his Rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wifes neck and a fancy pug roaming the house...   Dear Mr. Criminal,   Which house would you like to break into.   SIncerely,   1 constitutional rights violator and 1 law abiding citizen.",1,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a sincere, detailed description of a person's home defense setup. the tone is serious and informative, displaying knowledge about various weapons and defense strategies. while the content might seem extreme to some readers, there's no clear indication of sarcasm or irony in the way it's presented.

the author goes into specific technical details about their weapons, showing a level of expertise and seriousness that doesn't align with sarcastic intent. they also mention their training and emphasize the importance of preparedness, which further supports the notion that this is a genuine, albeit perhaps overzealous, account of their home defense strategy.

the comparison at the end between their setup and a hypothetical less-prepared individual (vor) is meant to emphasize their point about preparedness rather than to mock or be sarcastic. the final ""challenge"" to potential criminals is presented as a rhetorical device to underscore the effectiveness of their defense setup, not as a sarcastic remark.

therefore, based on the content and tone, this text is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.   Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.",1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine argument presenting a logical stance on moral judgments, societal views, and the role of religion in forming opinions. the tone is direct and assertive, but it doesn't contain the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. the content aligns closely with the cues provided, discussing moral judgments, societal views, and the use of religion as a basis for opinions without employing sarcastic language.",0
"So now you are saying that the earth doesn't move? I get it. The earth used to be fixed at the center of the universe when those Bible verses were written but God changed it. Now it orbits the sun like the other planets.   Actually, the verse does say that grasshoppers have four legs. There is no mention of jumping legs. You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error.   You ""interpret"" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.",1,"label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony and exaggeration to criticize someone's inconsistent interpretation of the bible. the sarcasm is particularly evident in the opening sentences where the author mockingly suggests that god changed the earth's position in the universe to align with scientific discoveries.

the author is pointing out the logical inconsistencies in their opponent's argument, using a tone that is critical and mocking. they're highlighting how the person they're addressing seems to selectively interpret the bible literally or figuratively based on what aligns with modern scientific understanding.

the use of phrases like ""i get it"" and ""actually"" in a context where the author clearly disagrees with the statements that follow is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the overall tone is one of ridicule towards the idea of selectively interpreting religious texts to fit with scientific knowledge while claiming to take them literally.",1
"Oh really the people who where behind the petition drive here in michigan want to deny me marriage, Here I will let the head of the organization that spearheaded the drive explain it in her own words.   http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=19408",1,"based on the analysis of the cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""oh really"" at the beginning sets a sarcastic tone.
2. the author is presenting the opposing viewpoint (denying them marriage rights) in a way that implies strong disagreement.
3. the phrase ""here i will let the head of the organization... explain it in her own words"" is likely not a genuine offer, but rather a sarcastic way to highlight what the author sees as the absurdity or unfairness of the organization's position.
4. the inclusion of the link suggests the author is inviting readers to see the opposing viewpoint, not because they agree with it, but to emphasize how wrong they believe it to be.

the overall tone and structure of the text strongly indicate that the author is using sarcasm to express their disapproval and frustration with the petition drive and its organizers.",1
BWAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH![/quote]So you are saying that my DNA reflects the fact that I live in Texas?,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the exaggerated laughter ""bwaaaaaaahahahahahahahah!"" at the beginning suggests an over-the-top reaction, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
2. the follow-up question ""so you are saying that my dna reflects the fact that i live in texas?"" seems to be a hyperbolic interpretation of something previously said, which is another common sarcastic technique.
3. the combination of the extreme laughter and the seemingly absurd question about dna reflecting living in texas creates a contrast that is typical of sarcastic humor.
4. without full context, it appears the speaker is mockingly responding to a statement or implication about dna and living in texas, using sarcasm to highlight the perceived ridiculousness of such a connection.

while we don't have the full context, the elements present in this short exchange strongly suggest a sarcastic tone.",1
"Those walking sperm will be funding your social security in the future, Matt. What will your sperm be doing besides causing stains?",1,"label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. it uses crude humor and a mocking tone to make a point about reproduction and future social security funding. the rhetorical question at the end and the derogatory way of referring to children as ""walking sperm"" are strong indicators of sarcasm. the comment is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to insult or criticize the person being addressed (matt) in a sardonic manner.",1
"Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view.",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to criticize the idea of writing from an embryo's perspective. the speaker is pointing out the absurdity of this concept by comparing it to writing from a rock's point of view, which is equally impossible. this comparison highlights the speaker's sarcastic tone and intention to mock the original idea.

the cues support this interpretation by confirming that embryos and rocks indeed do not have consciousness or a point of view, which is the factual basis for the sarcastic comment. the speaker is using this common knowledge to create a satirical comparison, emphasizing the ridiculousness of the initial premise.",1
Actually quite a common name in South America... but I know what you mean.,1,"based on the available information and analysis of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

not sarcastic

How cruel can you be,1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere and emotional expression of frustration and pain regarding the inequality faced by non-heterosexual individuals in terms of marriage rights. the speaker is directly addressing someone who doesn't understand their perspective, using strong emotional language and personal examples to illustrate their point. the tone is serious and impassioned, without any indicators of sarcasm or irony. the emotional contrasts highlighted in the cues further support the genuine nature of this statement, reflecting real feelings of frustration, love, and a sense of injustice.",0
and,1,"based on the provided cues and the single word input ""and"", there is not enough context or information to determine if this is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the word ""and"" by itself does not convey any sentiment or tone that would indicate sarcasm. therefore, i cannot reliably assign a label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input.",0
"Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.",1,"sarcastic

this text appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. rhetorical question: the opening ""where are those organizations with such scientific rigor?"" is likely not a genuine inquiry, but a skeptical challenge to the existence of such organizations.

2. exaggerated language: the use of ""worshipping"" in relation to scientific organizations suggests an over-the-top characterization.

3. ""god of the gaps"" reference: this philosophical concept is often used critically to point out flaws in certain arguments. its use here, especially with the term ""worshipping,"" implies a mocking tone.

4. contrast between ""scientific rigor"" and religious terminology: this juxtaposition creates a sense of irony.

5. ""microscopic"" as a descriptor: this suggests that the ""god of the gaps"" has become so small as to be almost non-existent, which is a sarcastic way of critiquing the organizations' beliefs or methods.

the overall tone is one of skepticism and criticism, delivered through sarcastic rhetoric rather than straightforward statement.",1
"Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death.

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere explanation of how observing nature can lead to understanding the role of death and scavengers in ecosystems. it doesn't contain typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. instead, it presents a straightforward observation about the prevalence of death in nature and the efficiency of natural systems in recycling organic matter through scavengers. the tone is informative and matter-of-fact, consistent with a non-sarcastic statement.",0

And many of the questions that creationists ask.,1,"not sarcastic

the input text ""and many of the questions that creationists ask."" appears to be a neutral, factual statement without any indicators of sarcasm. based on the provided cues and the content of the statement itself, there's no evidence of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the sentence seems to be a straightforward reference to questions posed by creationists, likely in the context of a broader discussion about creationism or debates between creationism and scientific theories. therefore, the most appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0
"Your use of language is rather colourful here (lying propagandist!) and smacks of hyperbole. What is being critisised here is bad application of the scientific method in relation to National Geographic's articles on the nature of relationship between birds and dinosaurs. I think Olsen makes some very pertinent points, but at no stage is he saying that evolution does not occur or the possibility that there is no link between any theropods and birds ever.   What he correctly draws attention to is poor peer review and less than conclusive evidence to support the hypothesis of the article's author. In turn this is a stinging criticism of the NG given its high profile, reputation and claim to being a leading forum for the presentation of science in a popular format.",1,"based on the content and context provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a serious, critical response to another statement or article. it provides a nuanced explanation of olsen's criticism of national geographic's articles, emphasizing the focus on scientific methodology rather than a denial of evolution. the tone is analytical and aimed at clarifying misconceptions, without employing sarcasm or irony.",0
"gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?",1,"based on the provided input and cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

the text ""gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" exhibits clear sarcastic elements. the phrase ""gooey cute"" is used dismissively to describe something as overly sentimental or saccharine, which contrasts sharply with the expected seriousness of philosophical discourse. the question about relevance further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, implying that the content being referred to is out of place or inappropriate for a philosophical discussion. this juxtaposition of cuteness with philosophy, along with the questioning of relevance, strongly indicates a sarcastic intent.",1

"There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils   It also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.   +It predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument. How could anyone argue with your brand of logic? That would be senseless.",1,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
while the text uses some rhetorical devices and occasionally employs a mocking tone, it is not fundamentally sarcastic. the author is genuinely presenting arguments in favor of creationism and against evolutionary theory. the text aligns with the context provided in the cues, offering a sincere, albeit controversial, perspective on the origins of life and the universe. the author is earnestly challenging evolutionary theory and supporting a biblical interpretation, using what they consider to be evidence and logical arguments to support their viewpoint. although some phrases might seem sarcastic out of context, the overall intent of the text is to seriously argue for creationism, not to mock or satirize evolution.",0
"And the moon could fall from the sky, too.",1,sarcastic,1
"It surely doesn't sound like he's a Nazi to me, but then again, I don't suffer from paranoid delusions either.",1,"based on the provided context and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic. the speaker uses irony to criticize those who are making accusations of someone being a nazi. the sarcasm is particularly evident in the second part of the sentence, where the speaker implies that only someone with ""paranoid delusions"" would think the person in question is a nazi. this indirect and mocking way of disagreeing with the accusation is a classic example of sarcastic speech.",1
"Let me see if I have this right, Priscilla. You admit your ignorance of the topic and you refuse to read the linked article in order to learn the topic of the thread, and yet you are willing to offer an opinion.   As Mr. Jack said, interesting.",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. the emotional contrasts you've highlighted, combined with the tone and structure of the message, strongly indicate sarcasm. here's why:

1. the speaker begins with ""let me see if i have this right,"" which is often used sarcastically to point out flaws in someone's logic or behavior.

2. the contrasts between ignorance and opining, as well as between refusing to learn and eagerness to comment, are presented in a way that emphasizes the absurdity of priscilla's approach.

3. the final sentence, ""as mr. jack said, interesting,"" is likely using ""interesting"" ironically to mean ""ridiculous"" or ""foolish.""

4. the overall structure of the message, which lays out priscilla's contradictory behavior step by step, is a common sarcastic technique used to highlight inconsistencies.

these elements, combined with the critical tone implied by the contrasts, clearly indicate that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize priscilla's approach to the discussion.",1
"I dunno, maybe it was in the third trimester?",1,not sarcastic,0
"Hmmm... interesting. Where does this inalianable right derive from and how does it really work? I mean, clearly you cannot create your own army called Islamic Jihad of Al queda Supporters and start to develop weapons of mass destruction on your own farm, regardless if that organisation actually interfer with someone else.   As for bootlicking   Please drop the rethorics and explain how you mean instead.",1,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine inquiry seeking clarification on the concept of inalienable rights and their limitations. while the tone is somewhat skeptical and the example used is extreme, the overall intent seems to be to understand the topic better rather than to mock or use sarcasm. the request at the end for an explanation without rhetoric further supports that this is a sincere, albeit provocative, set of questions and not a sarcastic statement.",0
"Way to make a controversial, unsupported assertion, Winston!",1,sarcastic,1
"Yes they sure will.... with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns. But if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole (literary form of exageration to express a point) I will try in the future to keep it down to your level.",1,"sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic. the author uses exaggeration and a condescending tone to make their point about the relative dangers of guns versus drownings. the sarcasm is particularly evident in the final sentence, where the author mockingly suggests they'll ""keep it down to your level"" for someone who doesn't understand hyperbole. this is a classic use of sarcasm to criticize an opposing viewpoint while presenting statistics to support their argument.",1
"So you are saying that despite the majority of the public opposing gay marriage, opposing it may be the wrong direction?   Good for you. You're getting it.",1,"based on the provided cues and the context of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text exhibits characteristics of sarcasm, particularly in the phrases ""good for you"" and ""you're getting it."" while these phrases might appear positive on the surface, the context suggests they are being used ironically. 

the speaker is responding to someone who is questioning the majority stance against gay marriage. by saying ""good for you. you're getting it,"" the speaker is not genuinely praising the other person, but rather using a mocking tone to imply that the realization should have been obvious.

the contrast between the seemingly encouraging words and the underlying critical tone is a hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express disapproval or criticism of the other person's slow realization, rather than sincere approval.",1
"And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward, earnest response in a discussion. the speaker is directly addressing another person, explaining why they think that person might be a troll, and then providing a sincere assessment of the expertise levels within their community. the language used is analytical and descriptive, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm. the speaker acknowledges the presence of knowledgeable individuals while explaining the sources of their knowledge, which comes across as a genuine observation rather than a sarcastic remark.",0
"Wrong again sherlock. All of this animosity is after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian Nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity. That was why they signed fatwas against us originally. It is the abortions, gay marriage and our women walking around half naked that caused that lack of respect to occur. And you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to Americas image. It was the Left that coined the phrase, ""If it feels good, do it,"" Not the Right.",1,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere expression of the author's views on the reasons for radical islamic animosity towards the united states. the language is direct and assertive, presenting a specific perspective on cultural conflicts without employing sarcasm or irony. the author seems to genuinely attribute the issues to left-wing politics and the export of american pop culture, which aligns with the cues provided about the text's topic. the strong opinions and accusatory tone are indicative of a earnest, albeit controversial, viewpoint rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
But they consider the exact same thing inside a human that has yet to be implanted a pregnancy?   Double standards much?,1,"based on the input text and the emotional cue provided, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the rhetorical question format suggests the speaker is not genuinely asking for information, but rather making a point.

2. the phrase ""double standards much?"" at the end is a classic sarcastic expression used to point out perceived hypocrisy or inconsistency.

3. the cue ""double standards"" is explicitly used, which is often employed in sarcastic critiques.

4. the overall tone implies frustration with what the speaker sees as an illogical or hypocritical stance, using sarcasm to highlight this perceived inconsistency.

therefore, this text can be confidently labeled as sarcastic.",1
"And would you care to tell us just what those ""official ideological goals"" are and where we might find a certifiable copy of them?",1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the input text demonstrates several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""official ideological goals"" suggests skepticism about the legitimacy of these goals.

2. the phrasing ""would you care to tell us"" is a polite form that often masks sarcasm or challenge in this context.

3. the request for a ""certifiable copy"" implies doubt that such a document actually exists, further emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

4. the overall structure of the question is rhetorical, designed to challenge rather than genuinely seek information.

this sarcastic tone aligns with the cues mentioning skepticism, doubt, and challenging previous claims, making ""sarcastic"" the appropriate label for this input.",1
"Oh, I dunno guys... I think I've been saved.   *sings* ""I've been redeemed, by the blood of the lamb..."" ummm... barbequed lamb.... rare... yumm....   I'm wondering, Benjamin, if you would trade some photos of the Holy Pink Bunny for the shroud of Turin?",1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text mixes religious themes with casual, humorous elements like barbecued lamb and trading religious artifacts. this incongruous combination and irreverent tone strongly indicates the speaker is being sarcastic rather than sincere about religious salvation.",1
"Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?",1,"based on my analysis of the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text is a detailed, logical argument about gun control regulations. the author is presenting their views earnestly and addressing various counterarguments. there's no indication of sarcasm or irony in the text. instead, the author is making a genuine effort to explain their position, using analogies, examples, and responding to potential criticisms. the tone is serious and argumentative throughout, consistent with a non-sarcastic debate on a complex political issue.",0
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward commentary on cross-jurisdictional police escorts and a criticism of the article's author. while there is some frustration expressed towards the author's reporting, the overall tone is informative and critical rather than sarcastic. the text is primarily presenting factual information about common practices in the area and pointing out a discrepancy in the reporting. there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm in the statement.",0
"Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there.",1,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere, though opinionated, discussion about abortion, personal responsibility, and related ethical issues. the author is expressing their genuine views on these topics, presenting arguments and responding to counterpoints. while the tone is sometimes critical or judgmental, it doesn't exhibit the irony, mockery, or exaggeration typically associated with sarcasm. the author seems to be earnestly conveying their perspective on a serious subject, making it clear that this is not intended as a sarcastic piece.",0

""Lie, cheat, steal and fabricate to get people to be believe.""",1,"based on the content and tone of the input text, as well as the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the opening sentence ""well maybe that will teach him to get a education for once"" is clearly sarcastic, implying the opposite of its literal meaning.

2. the author criticizes creationist arguments and tactics, using exaggerated language that suggests mockery.

3. the final quote, ""lie, cheat, steal and fabricate to get people to be believe,"" is a hyperbolic representation of creationist methods, further indicating a sarcastic tone.

the text aligns with the provided cues, discussing education, the evolution vs. creationism debate, and accusing creationists of dishonest tactics. the sarcastic tone is used to emphasize the author's criticism of creationist arguments and methods.",1
"Or, given that this is about feasts, a waist is a terrible thing to mind.",1,"given the analysis provided in the cues and examining the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the input text is indeed sarcastic. it cleverly plays on the well-known phrase ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste"" by substituting ""waist"" for ""waste"" and rearranging the words to create a humorous pun. this wordplay, combined with the contrast between enjoying feasts and worrying about one's waistline, clearly indicates sarcastic intent. the statement humorously suggests prioritizing enjoyment of food over concerns about weight gain, which is contrary to typical health advice, further emphasizing its sarcastic nature.",1
"The guys who want guns in their homes to protect themselves from burglars or ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" call others full of fear and mistrust?",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is pointing out the irony in gun owners accusing others of being ""full of fear and mistrust"" when their own reasons for owning guns (protection from burglars or potential revolution) are themselves rooted in fear and mistrust of others or the government. the sarcastic tone is evident in the way the author frames this contradiction, highlighting the inconsistency in the gun owners' logic.",1

"Once cannot abort a pregnancy if it has not begun.   The morning after pill prevents a pregnancy from ever occuring by preventing the fertilized egg from implanting.

Do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant?",1,"based on the given input and the extracted cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the text uses a logical argument to point out the absurdity of considering pregnancy to begin at conception, particularly by extending this definition to its illogical conclusion with the petri dish example. the final rhetorical question, ""do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant?"" is clearly sarcastic, highlighting the author's view that defining pregnancy as beginning at conception leads to ridiculous outcomes. this use of reductio ad absurdum is a common sarcastic technique to criticize a particular viewpoint.",1
"Because his, as a Christian, doesn't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does.   ""Quote mine"" - looks like that will be a common acusation here. If I keep things concise and readable, I'm quote mining. That quote wasn't about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution, far more than ""believers"" (creationists)   And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.   Again, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying.   No, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to ""correct"" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6. Miller didn't misinterpret him at all. In note #47, Lewontin even mentioned the NY Times!   Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools. We have to more and more, as atheism is established.   It's a deal, if you'll put a hold on lecturing me about reading comprension as you ignore very relevant notes in the rear of the book.   The one where he bragged about defeating Henry Morris, a Christian? (pp 172, 173)   Sure they were, Christians are always opposing Christianity! All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!   And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.   Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited.   So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about ""preachers"", he wasn't referring to priests? I've seen it all now.   As I said, I hope to learn if all theistic evolution does not believe in original sin. I'd like to know if all Catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale.",1,"based on the input text and the provided context, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
while the text contains some argumentative and confrontational language, it does not appear to be sarcastic. the author is engaging in a serious debate about religion, evolution, and related topics. they are making direct rebuttals to various points, expressing disagreement, and asking questions. the tone is passionate and sometimes critical, but it doesn't employ irony or mock sincerity that would be characteristic of sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a genuine expression of the author's views and counterarguments in an ongoing discussion about complex and contentious topics.",0
"Well, that is the argument that one hears from creationists so often. So when are you going to get to the most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment? Even more important, when are you going to expose the theory of evolution? YOu don't seriously propose that your little series of cow pies is actually meaningful, do you?",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. the text displays clear hallmarks of sarcasm, including:

1. mocking tone: the phrase ""delicious, highly satisfying entertainment"" is clearly not meant sincerely.

2. rhetorical questions: ""so when are you going to..."" and ""you don't seriously propose... do you?"" are not genuine questions but sarcastic challenges.

3. derogatory language: referring to someone's work as ""your little series of cow pies"" is a sarcastic and dismissive way of criticizing it.

4. exaggerated language: the use of ""expose the theory of evolution"" suggests a sarcastic attitude towards those who believe evolution needs to be ""exposed.""

5. overall confrontational tone: the entire message is framed in a way that's not seeking genuine answers but rather mocking the ideas being discussed.

these elements, combined with the context provided about creationism and evolution, strongly indicate that this text is sarcastic in nature.",1
"By far most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech.

If Canada limited it's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem.",1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere expression of the author's views on the topic of speech about homosexuality, criticism of gay advocacy groups, and concerns about laws in canada. while the opinions expressed are controversial and potentially offensive to some, the statement does not exhibit typical markers of sarcasm such as irony, exaggeration for humorous effect, or saying the opposite of what is meant. instead, it seems to be a direct and literal expression of the author's beliefs on this contentious subject.",0
"Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you",1,"based on the input text and the provided context, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. it opens with a rhetorical question that mocks the other person's intelligence: ""prove something besides your ignorance?""

2. the tone is confrontational and condescending, listing differences between homo erectus and neanderthals in a way that implies the other person should already know this.

3. it concludes with a mocking statement: ""i can see why people are laughing at you""

these elements, combined with the context of a heated debate about human evolution, strongly indicate that the speaker is using sarcasm to belittle their opponent's knowledge and argument. the sarcasm serves to emphasize the speaker's perceived superiority in the discussion.",1
I see. So what you are saying is that you are unsure about evolution and wish to explore it. Great. Then start with one of those unreasonable and dumb arguments and present it. Why are you more reasonable and not so dumb?   It's easy to do what you have done. I can claim that invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky. I can claim that you are unreasonable and dumb because you disagree with me. But it is meaningless unless I am willing to show that I have a pair and can step up and show why I am right.   Do you have a pair?,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. it starts with a feigned understanding (""i see. so what you are saying is..."") that's likely not sincere.
2. it uses exaggerated and absurd examples (invisible pink unicorns pushing the moon) to mock the other person's argumentation style.
3. the tone is confrontational and challenging, using phrases like ""do you have a pair?"" which is colloquial and provocative.
4. it sarcastically invites the other person to present ""unreasonable and dumb arguments,"" implying that's what they've been doing.
5. the overall structure mimics a reasonable argument but is clearly meant to criticize and ridicule the other person's position.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic message that's meant to challenge and criticize the other person's argumentation style and lack of evidence, rather than engage in a straightforward debate about evolution.",1

the text appears to be a sarcastic response to someone else's interpretation or explanation of scripture. the sarcastic tone is evident from the opening line:

""sure let me have your sermon/propaganda of misinformation since it doesn't match the context of the scriptures.""

this statement is clearly not meant to be taken at face value. the author is using irony to criticize the other person's interpretation, implying that it's misleading or out of context.

the rest of the text provides definitions and biblical quotes, seemingly to support the author's own interpretation and to further highlight the perceived flaws in the other person's understanding. the overall tone and structure of the response, starting with that sarcastic opening, indicates that this is indeed a sarcastic text.",1
Probably because buildings aren't biological or reproductive.,1,"sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic. the phrasing ""probably because..."" followed by stating obvious facts about buildings not being biological or reproductive entities suggests a sarcastic tone. the speaker is likely responding to an absurd or illogical statement or question about buildings with deliberate understatement, pointing out the obvious in a dry, humorous manner. this kind of response is a common sarcastic technique used to highlight the absurdity of a situation or previous statement.",1
How informative.,1,"sarcastic

i've chosen to output the label directly because i'm confident in this judgment based on the given information and context.

the phrase ""how informative."" on its own is typically used sarcastically. while the word ""informative"" itself has a positive connotation, the brief, standalone nature of this comment strongly suggests sarcasm. 

people often use this phrase ironically to imply that something was actually not informative at all. without any additional context to indicate sincere appreciation, the default interpretation of this short statement is sarcastic.

the cues provided also support this interpretation, noting that this phrase is ""typically used sarcastically to indicate that something is not actually informative at all.""

therefore, i've labeled this input as ""sarcastic.""",1
"2, A. Myth;   Complete fabrication.",1,not sarcastic,0
In other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law.   Admit it.,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. it uses exaggeration and accusation (""you're happier"") to highlight the perceived inappropriateness of someone's reaction.

2. there's a stark contrast between the positive emotion (""happier"") and the negative action (""something criminal""), which is a common sarcastic device.

3. the phrase ""admit it"" at the end adds a confrontational tone that's often used in sarcastic statements to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.

4. the overall context implies criticism of someone's attitude towards a criminal act, using irony to make this point.

these factors strongly indicate that the statement is intended to be sarcastic, critiquing someone's apparent pleasure at an illegal act rather than being a genuine accusation.",1
"Wonder what ""euthanization"" is. Never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary.",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. contrasting knowledge: the speaker claims to not know what ""euthanization"" means, yet uses the term correctly in quotation marks, suggesting they actually do know what it means.

2. exaggeration: claiming that ""neither has the dictionary"" is an exaggeration, as euthanization (more commonly known as euthanasia) is a well-established term found in dictionaries.

3. feigned ignorance: the phrase ""never heard of it before"" seems to be a deliberate understatement, given that euthanasia is a fairly well-known concept.

4. tone: the overall tone of the statement suggests a mocking or ironic attitude towards the concept of euthanization, rather than genuine confusion.

the sarcasm here appears to be commenting on the controversial nature of euthanasia, using feigned ignorance and exaggeration to make a point about the topic's sensitive or taboo status in some contexts.",1
Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.,1,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the analysis of the input text and the provided cues. the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""oxymoron"" to describe reasonable gun regulation, implying that it's a contradiction in terms.
2. the comparison to ""military intelligence,"" which is a common sarcastic phrase implying that military and intelligence are incompatible.
3. the rhetorical question ""you mean like..."" followed by examples that seem to contradict the point being made.
4. the phrase ""wait my bad"" is used sarcastically to introduce a point that undermines the previous implication.

the cues also support this interpretation, noting the sarcastic and confrontational tone, as well as the use of ""oxymoron"" and ""bad"" in a context that implies criticism rather than sincere emotion. the overall negative sentiment conveyed through context rather than explicit emotional words is characteristic of sarcasm.",1
"So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread?

But I hope you don't do it again.",1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine, albeit somewhat judgmental, response in a serious discussion about abortion and christianity. the tone is direct and questioning, but it doesn't contain the irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. the author is expressing their honest opinion and asking straightforward questions about the other person's motivations and beliefs. the language used, including references to sin, forgiveness, and god's love, suggests a sincere engagement with the topic rather than a sarcastic dismissal.",0
"So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?",1,sarcastic,1
So you think Zeus and all the other Greek gods exist?,1,"based on the input text and the provided context, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

this question is likely sarcastic because:

1. greek mythology is widely understood to be a set of ancient beliefs and stories, not currently practiced as a religion by most people.

2. the phrasing ""so you think..."" often introduces a skeptical or sarcastic tone, implying disbelief in the idea being presented.

3. asking about belief in zeus and ""all the other greek gods"" in a modern context is typically done to highlight the perceived absurdity of believing in these mythological figures, rather than as a genuine inquiry about someone's religious beliefs.

4. the question seems rhetorical, implying that the answer is obviously ""no,"" which is a common structure for sarcastic statements.

therefore, the statement ""so you think zeus and all the other greek gods exist?"" is most likely intended to be sarcastic, questioning or mocking the idea of believing in greek mythology as literal truth in the present day.",1
And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.,1,sarcastic,1
"Yes, have you?",1,"given the limited context provided by the input ""yes, have you?"", it's not possible to definitively determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, context, and the broader conversation, which are not available here.

however, based solely on the text provided, i would lean towards labeling this as:

### label:
not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the phrase ""yes, have you?"" is a common, straightforward response in everyday conversation.
2. it appears to be a genuine question following an affirmative answer.
3. there are no obvious linguistic markers of sarcasm (like exaggeration or contradiction) in this short phrase.

without more context or cues about tone or the surrounding conversation, it's safest to assume this is a non-sarcastic, sincere response and follow-up question. however, it's important to note that in certain contexts or with specific tones of voice, this same phrase could potentially be used sarcastically.",0
Oh!   Did you mean something like this in gun free France:   http://www.guardian.co.uk/internatio...ews+-+guardian   Those weapons were cheap and from an eastern block country. Machine guns are for sissy American felons. Real felons in gun free France use anti-tank weapons.,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text uses exaggeration and irony to make a point about gun control laws in france. the author sarcastically refers to france as ""gun free"" while pointing out an incident involving heavy weapons. the contrast between the idea of strict gun control and criminals using anti-tank weapons is intentionally hyperbolic, which is a common feature of sarcasm. the final sentence, comparing american felons to french felons, further emphasizes the sarcastic tone of the entire statement.",1
We DID learn about selective hearing in health class.,1,not sarcastic,0
You should refrain from calling others arrogant Mr. Kettle.,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

this statement is indeed sarcastic. it cleverly references the idiom ""the pot calling the kettle black"" by addressing ""mr. kettle"" and suggesting they shouldn't call others arrogant. the irony lies in the implication that ""mr. kettle"" is likely being arrogant themselves by criticizing others for arrogance. this subtle use of the idiom and the ironic advice create a sarcastic tone in the statement.",1

Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear signs of sarcasm, particularly in the opening phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" and the exaggerated claim that ""nothing will ever change your mind."" the tone is mocking and critical, using irony to imply the opposite of what is literally stated. the author is sarcastically criticizing darwinists for being closed-minded and basing their beliefs on materialism rather than evidence, which aligns with the cues provided about the text's content and intent.",1
"Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping.",1,sarcastic,1
No I can't marry them becasue some of them are married. Also none have intent to li ve within Mass.,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text directly states a logical reason why the person can't marry ""them"": some are already married, which aligns with the common knowledge that marriage requires both parties to be unmarried.
2. the text also mentions another practical reason: none of the people intend to live in massachusetts (abbreviated as ""mass"" in the text), which corresponds to the common knowledge that married couples typically live together.
3. the tone of the text is straightforward and matter-of-fact, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.
4. the misspellings (""becasue"" and ""li ve"") are likely typos rather than intentional markers of sarcasm.

given these factors, the text appears to be a sincere explanation of why marriage is not possible in this situation, rather than a sarcastic comment.",0

sarcastic

the text uses exaggerated and provocative language in a way that is clearly not meant to be taken literally. the exclamation points, quotation marks around ""unbalanced"", and the stark contrast between calling abortion ""fun"" while also describing it as ""traumatic"" and ""killing"" indicate this is a sarcastic statement meant to criticize pro-choice views on abortion. the tone is biting and mock-enthusiastic, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.",1
"They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.",1,"sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcasm through the contrast between valuing ""science and common sense"" and a world where these are considered ""irrelevant."" this juxtaposition creates a mocking tone towards those who disregard scientific and logical thinking, implying their views are absurd or irrational. the phrase ""in their world"" further emphasizes this divide and the speaker's critical stance. this use of irony and implicit criticism is characteristic of sarcastic expression.",1
"If this is your stance, then it's your job to prove it correct. Show us that Britain is just fine, show us that the criminals aren't awarded more protection than their victims.   Show us thimble head. Show us or shut up.",1,"based on the context provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. the use of the mocking term ""thimble head"" indicates a derisive tone.
2. the challenge to ""show us or shut up"" is confrontational and implies disbelief in the opposing viewpoint.
3. the exaggerated demand to ""show us that britain is just fine"" and to prove criminals aren't more protected than victims is likely meant to highlight the perceived absurdity of the opposing stance.
4. the overall tone is combative and uses hyperbole, which are common features of sarcastic rhetoric in debates.

the sarcasm here is used to criticize and challenge the opposing viewpoint, implying that the speaker believes the contrary - that britain is not fine and that criminals do receive more protection than victims.",1

"Oh, I get it?Flashlights and I-Pods have souls and consciousness.",1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the input text ""oh, i get it? flashlights and i-pods have souls and consciousness."" is clearly a sarcastic statement. the speaker is not genuinely expressing a belief that inanimate objects like flashlights and ipods have souls or consciousness. instead, they are using irony to mock or express disbelief at such an idea, likely in response to someone else's statement or argument. the phrase ""oh, i get it?"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone, indicating feigned understanding of an absurd concept.",1
Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine question asking for evidence, specifically quotes, to support a claim about endorsing monopolies. while the ""really."" at the beginning could potentially indicate skepticism, the overall tone of the question seems straightforward and sincere in requesting factual information. there are no clear markers of sarcasm or irony present in this brief statement.",0
"So you're a historian now?   Yes, you are right - the Civil War was fought to keep the union in tact. But, it is also a fact that Abraham Lincoln, the Commander in Chief of the Union Army, did not believe that the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   According to who? Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness, it in no way follows that all men are not created equal.   Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.",1,"sarcastic

the text contains several indicators of sarcasm:

1. the opening line ""so you're a historian now?"" is clearly sarcastic, implying that the person being addressed is not actually a historian but is speaking as if they were.

2. the tone throughout is confrontational and mocking, challenging the other person's knowledge and understanding of the civil war and lincoln's views.

3. there's an implicit criticism of the other person's argument, suggesting they lack deep knowledge of the subject while claiming expertise.

4. the closing sentences are particularly sarcastic, implying that the other person can't defend their position because it's fundamentally flawed.

these elements combine to create a highly sarcastic response to someone's claims about the civil war and lincoln's beliefs, making ""sarcastic"" the appropriate label for this text.",1

1. it starts with a dismissive ""i dunno,"" suggesting feigned ignorance or indifference.
2. it points out an apparent contradiction in the recipient's behavior (complaining yet returning), which is a common sarcastic technique.
3. the comparison to people with down syndrome is deliberately provocative and insensitive, likely meant to be a biting, sarcastic remark rather than a sincere statement.
4. the overall tone is confrontational and mocking, typical of sarcastic discourse.

the cues also support this interpretation, noting the frustrated and confrontational nature of the response, as well as the insensitive comparison. therefore, ""sarcastic"" is the appropriate label for this text.",1
"It was a pretty clear rebuttle of the idea that the ToE breeds social elitism, Marxism, and Nazisim.   I guess you're right though, SS. This wasn't nearly as entertaining as a slough of out-of-context quotes to show that ToE-accepting biologists reject the ToE.",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements, particularly in the second sentence. the author starts by agreeing with a straightforward rebuttal of claims linking the theory of evolution to controversial ideologies. however, the tone shifts dramatically in the second part, where they sarcastically agree with another person (presumably ""ss"") that this factual rebuttal isn't as ""entertaining"" as misrepresenting biologists' views through out-of-context quotes. this sarcastic agreement mocks the idea that sensationalized, misleading information is preferable to factual rebuttals, clearly indicating the use of sarcasm to criticize such an approach.",1
"So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.   And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. ""POOF! Goddidit!"" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk.",1,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a serious, detailed argument against the feasibility of noah's ark as described in the bible. the author presents logical arguments about the physical limitations of wood in large structures, particularly in shipbuilding. they discuss specific engineering challenges such as wood flexibility, structural support requirements, and the problems of maintaining a watertight hull at large scales.

the author also criticizes the use of divine intervention (""poof! goddidit!"") as an explanation for overcoming these physical constraints, but does so in a direct, critical manner rather than using sarcasm.

while the text does include some mildly humorous or ironic elements (like the comment about noah getting drunk), the overall tone and content are focused on presenting a rational argument against the plausibility of the noah's ark story. therefore, this text is best classified as not sarcastic.",0
"I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?",1,sarcastic,1
"But what if it is unconstitutional, like Prop. 8?   No, it doesn't.   Are you saying homosexuals aren't American? Are you saying that more of gay's right should be stripped, including that of protest? How dare them fight for their own freedoms? I should lend you my time machine, and you should go tell this to Malcom X.   And you still haven't responded to my post.",1,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

rationale:
the text appears to be a series of earnest, confrontational questions and statements in a heated debate about gay rights and constitutional issues. the tone is direct and passionate, with rhetorical questions challenging the other person's views. while the language is forceful and sometimes indignant (e.g., ""how dare them fight for their own freedoms?""), it doesn't exhibit the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. the references to historical civil rights struggles and constitutional matters suggest a serious discussion rather than a sarcastic exchange.",0
Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear sarcastic elements, particularly in the phrases ""here's a novel idea"" and ""just a thought."" these expressions are typically used to introduce ideas that the speaker believes should be obvious or have already been considered, but are being presented as if they were new or revolutionary. this creates a sarcastic tone throughout the message.

the content of the suggestion itself (improving access to birth control and information instead of promoting abstinence programs) is presented sincerely, but the framing of this idea as novel or just a passing thought is what makes the overall message sarcastic. the writer is using this sarcastic tone to criticize current policies and express frustration with approaches they view as ineffective.

the contrast between the sarcastic delivery and the serious subject matter further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the text. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1
And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...,1,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i would assign the following label:

sarcastic

the statement appears to be using exaggerated, inflammatory language to make a provocative point about political views in a sarcastic manner. the use of extreme phrasing like ""murdering innocent children"" in reference to complex political positions suggests this is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a sarcastic commentary. the ""and yet"" opening also implies a contradictory or ironic tone consistent with sarcasm.",1
"Hehehehehehe. That made me laugh, but you actually make a good point. They should have I AM JUST A THEORY written on them, otherwise kids will regard them as fact and then where will we be?",1,"sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the exaggerated laughter at the beginning (""hehehehehehe"") sets a mocking tone.
2. the initial agreement (""that made me laugh, but you actually make a good point"") is followed by an absurd suggestion, indicating the speaker isn't being sincere.
3. the idea of writing ""i am just a theory"" on something (likely referring to scientific theories or educational materials) is an exaggeration that pokes fun at the concept of distinguishing between theories and facts for children.
4. the rhetorical question at the end (""and then where will we be?"") further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, implying mock concern over an exaggerated scenario.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic comment that playfully criticizes an overly simplistic or cautious approach to presenting information to children.",1
"What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want.",1,"sarcastic

i'm assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. here's my reasoning:

1. unicorns are mythical creatures, not real animals. the text discusses their characteristics as if they were factual, which is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

2. the phrase ""what's your point?"" at the beginning sets a dismissive tone, often used in sarcastic responses.

3. the supposed ""facts"" about unicorns (toxic breath and low density) are absurd and not based on any real mythology or common depictions of unicorns. this exaggeration is a common sarcastic technique.

4. the casual way these outlandish characteristics are presented (""so they can get around all they want"") further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

5. the overall structure of the statement mimics a logical argument, but with completely fictional and nonsensical premises, which is a classic sarcastic approach.

given these factors, it's highly likely that this statement is meant to be sarcastic rather than a genuine assertion about unicorns.",1
Who is killing children?   Except for George Bush who has seen to the killing of thousands of children in Iraq.,1,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the text uses a rhetorical question followed by an accusatory statement about george bush, implying sarcasm in its criticism of bush's actions in iraq. the phrasing ""except for george bush who has seen to the killing of thousands of children in iraq"" suggests a bitterly ironic tone, typical of sarcastic political commentary.",1
And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies.,1,"based on the given context and input, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine observation about the nature of online comments sections, rather than a sarcastic remark. the speaker is likely expressing a sincere belief that user comments often contain more humor or entertainment value than the original content itself. this is a common sentiment shared by many internet users, and there's no clear indication of irony or sarcasm in the phrasing.",0
"Well Spam&amp;Scram is certainly the strangest of the anti-evolution crowd I've come across. He even proclaims that animals change as fact, not something that Creationists concede lightly.   He claims to know very little then decides he knows it all... (OK that's more like a Creationist.)   It might be intresting to see what happens if he came into contact with Creationists.",1,"based on the context provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text contains several elements that indicate sarcasm:

1. the use of ""certainly the strangest"" to describe spam&scram's views, which is likely an exaggeration.
2. the ironic observation that spam&scram accepts animal change as fact, which is unusual for creationists.
3. the parenthetical remark ""(ok that's more like a creationist.)"" is a clear sarcastic jab.
4. the final sentence suggesting it would be ""interesting"" to see spam&scram interact with other creationists implies an expectation of conflict or contradiction, which is often a setup for sarcastic humor.

these elements collectively create a tone of mockery and irony towards both spam&scram and creationists in general, making the text sarcastic in nature.",1
Well all you have to do is tell us the minimum time during which it could happen by NDS theory and then how long it actually took and we can compare the numbers. Of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers. Enjoy,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text demonstrates several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the exaggerated simplification of a complex task: ""well all you have to do is..."" suggests that the speaker is ironically presenting a difficult or involved process as if it were simple.

2. the tone is subtly mocking, implying that the task being requested is actually quite challenging or unreasonable.

3. the closing ""enjoy"" adds a final sarcastic touch, as if sardonically wishing the recipient pleasure in performing a tedious or complex task.

4. the overall structure of the statement presents a series of demands in a way that appears helpful on the surface but is actually highlighting the difficulty or absurdity of the request.

while the cues don't explicitly mention sarcasm, they do note that the text is about comparing theoretical and actual times for an event, which aligns with the content of the sarcastic statement. the sarcasm here is used to critique or comment on the complexity of such a comparison.",1
"Oh my stars and garters.   He actually admitted what ""the real issue"" is.",1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the use of the old-fashioned, exaggerated expression ""oh my stars and garters"" combined with the seemingly surprised reaction to someone admitting ""the real issue"" suggests a sarcastic tone. the speaker appears to be mock-surprised or feigning astonishment, likely implying that the admission was either obvious or long overdue. the quotation marks around ""the real issue"" further hint at skepticism or irony. this combination of exaggerated language and implied criticism is characteristic of sarcastic expression.",1
"hey, watch yourself.........watch it..",1,not sarcastic,0
"You believe that your interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than his, and he believes that his interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than yours. This is quite simple, but that's never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.   No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   ""Concise and readable"" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his ""citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts.""   I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the ""on"" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this ""power,"" too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble ""stomaching"" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc. I love helping you reach new lows.",1,"based on the analysis of the emotional cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text is filled with sarcastic remarks, critical commentary, and frustrated responses to someone named marc. the author uses exaggerated language, rhetorical questions, and mocking tone throughout the passage. key phrases like ""marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again"" (clearly sarcastic), ""keep on diggin', marc. i love helping you reach new lows,"" and the repetitive structure used to mock marc's arguments all point strongly to a sarcastic intent. the overall tone is combative, dismissive, and heavily laden with irony, making it a clear example of sarcastic discourse.",1
"and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.",1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. the opening rhetorical question ""and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars?"" sets a sarcastic tone right from the start. the author is using exaggeration and cynicism to criticize the methodology of studies on gay men, implying that researchers often use biased sampling methods that lead to skewed results.

the sarcasm continues throughout the text as the author mocks how studies can be manipulated to show predetermined outcomes based on where participants are recruited. the phrases ""studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say"" and ""if you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar"" are particularly sarcastic, highlighting the author's frustration with what they perceive as flawed research practices.

the overall tone is cynical and critical, using sarcasm to emphasize the importance of random sampling in obtaining accurate statistical data on gay men. the author's use of sarcasm serves to underscore their point about the difficulties in conducting unbiased studies on this population.",1
"Don't get me wrong sleazyrider I love babies, they're delicious!",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic, employing dark humor and an unexpected twist. the comment ""i love babies, they're delicious!"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's a shocking juxtaposition designed to provoke a reaction and create a humorous effect through its absurdity. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning.",1
"Hit that one right on the head, Symbiote. I'd like to hear supersport's response to this.",1,"based on my analysis of the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a genuine expression of agreement with ""symbiote's"" statement.
2. the phrase ""hit that one right on the head"" is a common idiom used to express sincere agreement.
3. the speaker shows genuine interest in hearing another person's (""supersport's"") response, which indicates engagement in a serious discussion.
4. there are no obvious contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would suggest sarcasm.
5. the tone is straightforward and lacks the typical markers of sarcasm such as hyperbole or mock enthusiasm.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere comment in an ongoing discussion, without any sarcastic intent.",0
"You know, from the title, I was sure this would be about The hitchhikers guede to the galaxy' bible fish...",1,"based on the given input and context cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits sarcasm because:

1. it expresses a mistaken expectation based on the title of something (likely an article or video).
2. the expectation is humorously off-base, referring to the ""babel fish"" from ""the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" (which is misspelled as ""bible fish"" and ""hitchhikers guede,"" adding to the humorous tone).
3. the use of ""you know"" at the beginning sets up a casual, potentially ironic tone.
4. the ellipsis at the end suggests a trailing off, often used to imply an unspoken ""but it wasn't"" or to emphasize the absurdity of the initial expectation.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic comment about the speaker's misguided expectations, likely regarding some content that had nothing to do with douglas adams' fictional universe.",1
"But don't you see?   They aren't sure.   They don't know.   They didn't ""prove"" anything!!",1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the rhetorical question ""but don't you see?"" sets up a mocking tone.
2. the use of short, emphatic statements creates a dramatic effect.
3. the quotation marks around ""prove"" suggest skepticism or derision towards the claim of proof.
4. the multiple exclamation points at the end indicate exaggerated emphasis, typical of sarcastic expressions.
5. the contrast between the speaker's apparent certainty and their portrayal of others' uncertainty is a common sarcastic device.

these elements, combined with the emotional contrasts noted in the cues, strongly indicate that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize or mock someone's lack of certainty or evidence.",1
And when the President speaks in public we could hand out guns to the audience so that they could respond to any assassination attempt.,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. the suggestion to hand out guns to the audience during a presidential speech as a response to potential assassination attempts is absurd and dangerous. it's an exaggerated, ridiculous proposal that no one would seriously advocate for. 

the use of such an outlandish idea is a classic hallmark of sarcasm, where an extreme or nonsensical suggestion is made to criticize or mock a related topic (in this case, likely gun policies or security measures). the provocative and shocking nature of the statement, as noted in the cues, further supports its classification as sarcasm.",1
"You forgot one. For trying to bring eugenics to the US. We wouldn't want those ""poor negros"" reproducing now would we?",1,"given the context and analysis provided, as well as the content and tone of the input text, i would classify this as:

sarcastic

the text uses dark sarcasm to criticize historical eugenics efforts in the us, particularly those targeting african americans. the quotation marks around ""poor negros"" and the rhetorical question at the end strongly indicate a sarcastic tone meant to highlight and condemn the racist ideology behind such policies.",1
So what are you trying to do here - smother everyone with bafflegab ?,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear sarcastic characteristics:

1. it's a rhetorical question that implies criticism.
2. the use of the term ""bafflegab"" (meaning complicated or technical language used to confuse or deceive) adds to the sarcastic tone.
3. the phrase ""smother everyone"" is hyperbolic and contributes to the sarcastic effect.

the cues also support this interpretation, noting the implied frustration, skepticism, and critical tone of the question. while there may not be a stark emotional contrast, the sarcasm is evident in the exaggerated and critical nature of the question.",1
Neither are yours. *GEE* *gasp* *amazement* *realization*   thistownwilleat-,1,sarcastic,1
"and a brain with no body kept on life support is only a brain...no person. If beg the question here. I deny that a level of intelligence is needed to deserve rights. I disagree that what you can do is a requirement..only what you are (that being a human).   Still, I quoted you as saying ""a basic human fundamental right""...I am not sure what this right is or where it comes from or why it is fundamental or why it only applies to the humans you think it should apply to. Perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again...after all, white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife...right?",1,"sarcastic

the text contains several indicators of sarcasm, particularly in its concluding statements. the author uses increasingly provocative and absurd arguments to challenge the position they're arguing against. the final sentence about restricting rights to ""white folks"" and comparing other humans to ""wildlife"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather to sarcastically highlight the perceived flaws in the opposing argument. this use of exaggeration and false equivalence to make a point is a hallmark of sarcastic rhetoric.

the overall argumentative tone, combined with the provocative language and the deliberately outrageous final comparison, strongly suggests that this text is sarcastic in nature, particularly in its conclusion.",1
"Oh, OK then.",1,"based on the available information and cues provided, i cannot reliably determine whether the input ""oh, ok then."" is sarcastic or not sarcastic. this short phrase is highly context-dependent, and its interpretation can vary greatly depending on the tone, situation, and preceding conversation, which are not provided here.

without additional context, this phrase could be a genuine acknowledgment or a sarcastic response. therefore, i cannot confidently assign a label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input.",0

### label:
not sarcastic

the input text presents a straightforward observation about the difficulty of making ethical choices compared to taking easier but less moral paths. the statement aligns with common perceptions about human behavior and morality. there are no linguistic cues or contextual hints that suggest the author is being ironic or sarcastic. instead, the text appears to be a genuine commentary on the challenges of maintaining ethical behavior in various aspects of life.",0
as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training? not a good option. my apology if that was a failed sarcasm.   -a|ex,1,"not sarcastic

this response is not sarcastic. the author is expressing genuine concern about the lack of gun control measures and apologizing for any potential misunderstanding in a previous comment. the tone is sincere and straightforward, without any ironic or sarcastic elements. the apology for ""failed sarcasm"" refers to a previous statement, not the current one.",0
Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations. Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots doesn't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different...,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to make its point. the exaggerated ""oh no"" and ""gasp!"" at the beginning, along with the capitalized ""wide and vast"" for emphasis, are strong indicators of sarcastic tone. the writer is using this sarcasm to criticize those who would attack an open-minded church, implying that such criticism is absurd and unwarranted.",1
"So, evolution is falsified because Ford didn't draft chimps to work the assembly lines?   I've never seen such nonsense paraded about with such pride. I'd congratulate you on your win DamEtel, but I'm more impressed with your patience.",1,sarcastic,1
And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the response exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it has a dismissive and unapologetic tone.
2. the phrase ""that's the breaks"" is used sarcastically to downplay the other person's potential offense.
3. the speaker acknowledges correcting the other person without showing empathy, which can be interpreted as sarcastic in this context.

the overall tone and phrasing suggest that the speaker is not genuinely concerned about the other person's feelings and is using sarcasm to deflect potential criticism of their behavior.",1
Jesus! Another scientific illiterate. The facts are the observations. And the point is not to test facts but to explain them with an hypothesis that suggests a prediction as a consequence that can be tested by experimentation.,1,"based on the content and tone of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text begins with an exclamation ""jesus!"" followed by a disparaging remark about ""scientific illiteracy,"" which sets a sarcastic tone. the author then proceeds to explain scientific concepts in a manner that suggests frustration with a perceived lack of understanding, using emphatic language to differentiate between facts, hypotheses, and predictions. this combination of exasperation and pointed explanation is characteristic of sarcastic commentary on someone's lack of knowledge or understanding.",1

Just because you can not figure out what those little numbers on the end of the things I have posted nor simply because you lack the mental fortitude to look back to some of my older posts or click and R*E*A*D the links to see that I have indeed provided ample backing does not mean that I haven't been doing MY job.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it uses hyperbole and generalization to criticize the ""evolutionary community,"" suggesting that ""most of them"" behave in a certain way.

2. the tone is mocking and dismissive, implying that members of this community are intolerant of debate or challenges.

3. the phrase ""i'm afraid"" is likely used sarcastically to feign politeness while actually expressing criticism.

4. the text aligns closely with the cues provided, which mention criticism of the evolutionary community's attitude towards debate and their alleged preference for expressing opinions without challenge.

5. the reference to exploring this issue in another thread (""numbers"" thread) adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that this behavior is a known and discussed problem.

given these factors, the text appears to be using sarcasm to criticize the perceived closed-mindedness of the evolutionary community in online discussions.",1
"How can they? If they exist in the mind and not on there own, then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws (Bivalency, Involution, Idempotency,Identity, (Non-)Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Contraction, Commutatively, DeMorgan's, Associatively, Distributivity) and they stop existing? Or I could say, ""hofflenosh"" is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either. If is existed only in the mined, it would not be absolute. It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist.",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: not sarcastic

this text appears to be a genuine philosophical argument questioning the nature and existence of logical laws. the writer is sincerely exploring the implications of logical laws being mental constructs rather than absolute truths. the tone is questioning and skeptical, but it doesn't employ sarcasm to make its point. instead, it uses examples and hypothetical scenarios to challenge the idea of logical laws as absolute entities. the text is consistent with the cues provided, which indicate a serious discussion about the nature of logical laws without any clear emotional contrasts or sarcastic elements.",0
"I take it you have no understanding of science, much less the scientific method?",1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the question is indeed phrased in a condescending and dismissive manner, implying the speaker believes the other person is ignorant about science and the scientific method. this type of rhetorical question, combined with the phrase ""i take it,"" is a classic example of sarcasm used to mock or belittle someone's perceived lack of knowledge.",1

"Not much of anything else either, it would seem.",1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:

"So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?   Wouldn't it just be easier, as well as more likely, for an emotionally disturbed student to just illegally bring a gun to school and kill their teacher, rather than waiting for a legal alternative to commit murder and go to prison anyway?",1,"sarcastic

After reading that I had to go talk to Ralph on the big white telephone.,1,"sarcastic

the phrase ""talk to ralph on the big white telephone"" is a humorous, euphemistic way of saying ""vomit into a toilet."" the use of this clever, roundabout expression instead of directly stating the act of vomiting suggests a sarcastic tone. 

the speaker is implying that what they read was so disgusting or upsetting that it made them physically ill, but they're expressing this in a witty, indirect manner rather than stating it plainly. this kind of exaggeration and use of colorful language to describe a negative reaction is characteristic of sarcasm.

the contrast between the formal-sounding ""after reading that"" and the slang euphemism that follows also contributes to the sarcastic tone. the speaker is using humor to express their strong distaste for whatever they read, which is a common sarcastic technique.

therefore, based on the use of euphemism, exaggeration, and humorous contrast, this statement can be classified as sarcastic.",1

All forms of life? Animal life? Plant life? The mold growing in your bathroom?,1,"based on the cues provided and the nature of the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

"Well, I think it is best to use a real source. Like the Australian FBI, called the A.I.C..   The latest figures. Violent crimes from 1996 to 2007 (per 100,000 persons per year)   Homicide is pretty much a flat line no? However there violent crime is not. And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.   So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?",1,"not sarcastic

the text does not exhibit characteristics of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward, analytical discussion of crime statistics in australia. the author is presenting factual information and making logical arguments about the interpretation of crime data. the tone is sincere and the points are made directly, without irony or mocking undertones that would typically indicate sarcasm.

the use of phrases like ""i think it is best"" and ""to be fair"" suggest the author is trying to present a balanced and honest perspective. the congratulatory remark about australia's lower murder rate seems genuine. overall, the text reads as a serious contribution to a discussion about crime statistics and gun control effectiveness, without any apparent sarcastic intent.",0
