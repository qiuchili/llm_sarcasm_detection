SHELDON: It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.,"LEONARD: I never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the Big Bang.
 SHELDON: My apologies. What's your plan?
",BBT,1,"given the context and the character of sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" this statement is likely to be sarcastic. sheldon is known for his condescending attitude and often uses sarcasm to express his superiority or frustration with others' intellectual capabilities.

the phrase ""it's just a privilege to watch your mind at work"" is typically used genuinely to express admiration, but coming from sheldon, it's more likely to be a backhanded compliment or outright mockery of someone's thought process.

therefore, i would confidently assign the label:

 SHELDON: Excuse me.
 SHELDON: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is using exaggeration and irony to comment on the cluttered state of the coffee table. he's not literally suggesting that the coffee table is having a garage sale; rather, he's implying that there are so many items on the coffee table that it resembles a miniature garage sale. this kind of witty, exaggerated observation is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially coming from a character like sheldon who is known for his dry humor and sarcastic remarks.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward hypothetical question posed by howard to sheldon in what seems to be a dialogue from a tv show or movie script. while the scenario presented is unusual (about sheldon potentially being a robot), there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the phrasing or context provided. the tone seems to be casual and conversational, setting up a thought experiment or discussion rather than employing sarcasm.",0.0
"SHELDON: If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.","SHELDON: Oh, good Lord.
 LEONARD: God, that's a good song.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text displays clear sarcastic elements through its exaggerated dark humor and mocking tone, which aligns with the language style analysis provided in the cues. the reference to a ""mix cd for a double suicide"" is an extreme, hyperbolic statement not meant to be taken literally, but rather to sarcastically criticize something. the abrupt shift to the scratching post comment further reinforces the sarcastic, biting humor. these elements strongly indicate that the correct label for this text is ""sarcastic"".",1.0
SHELDON: No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.,"LEONARD: How do I look?
 SHELDON: Could you be more specific?
 LEONARD: Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon's response is a prime example of dry, deadpan humor that's characteristic of sarcasm. he appears to be answering a question about whether something (likely sweat stains) is visible, and his reply is technically truthful but delivered in a way that's intentionally humorous and somewhat biting.

the use of precise, almost clinical language (""dark crescent-shaped patterns"") to describe what are likely sweat stains, combined with the assertion that these unflattering marks actually ""conceal it nicely,"" creates a perfect sarcastic juxtaposition. it's the kind of statement that seems helpful on the surface but is actually a thinly veiled insult or joke at the expense of the person being addressed.

this type of dialogue is very much in line with the character of sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" known for his socially awkward, highly literal, yet often unintentionally (or sometimes intentionally) sarcastic remarks.",1.0
"SHELDON: How's this? ""Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

 LEONARD: What?
 SHELDON: Nothing.
 LEONARD: Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
",BBT,1,"based on the information provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text is clearly a sarcastic greeting composed by sheldon. he uses polite language on the surface (""pleased to meet you"") but follows it with a series of backhanded compliments and thinly veiled insults about dr. gablehauser's lack of original research and the perceived low quality of his popular science books. the tone is unmistakably sarcastic, criticizing dr. gablehauser while pretending to congratulate him on his new position.",1.0

 PERSON: Nice meeting you.
 PENNY: Yeah, you, too.
Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello.
",BBT,1,"based on the content and context of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic. leonard is using dry humor to joke about his parents' choices, implying that they unintentionally set him up for bullying by giving him a nerdy name and putting him in advanced classes. the sarcasm lies in the implication that his parents were somehow trying to get him ""beaten up"" when in reality they were likely trying to give him advantages. this type of self-deprecating humor about one's upbringing is a common form of sarcasm.",1.0

 SHELDON: We play teams, not one-on-one.
 SHELDON: One-on-one.
 LEONARD: The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. it employs dark humor and exaggeration to make a point about the dehumanization of foreigners. the casual suggestion of violence (""cut the foreigner in half"") combined with the dismissive attitude (""there's a billion more where he came from"") creates a stark contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm. the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to highlight and criticize a callous attitude towards foreign individuals.",1.0

 SHELDON: Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the provided cues and the context of the input. the statement from sheldon has several indicators of sarcasm:

1. the apology (""i'm sorry, too"") is immediately followed by a contradictory statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

2. the use of a figurative expression about his wallet to reject someone is likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a sardonic way of saying he won't accommodate the person in some way.

3. the tone described in the cues as ""dismissive or reluctant"" aligns with a sarcastic interpretation.

4. the language style analysis provided in the cues explicitly mentions that the tone appears sarcastic.

given these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that sheldon's statement is indeed sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

 PENNY: I know the reason.
 LEONARD: We all know the reason.
 LEONARD: Sheldon, what are you getting at?
",BBT,0,"based on the analysis of the language style and context provided, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the formal language, rhetorical question, and intellectual reference to a fictional character suggest sheldon is making an exaggerated comparison between a real person and a literary figure, likely in a deadpan or sarcastic manner typical of his character. the enthusiasm about seeing a ""beloved fictional character come to life"" further implies he's not being entirely sincere, but rather making a wry observation.",1.0

 RAJ: I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised.
 RAJ: But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the cue correctly identifies the use of verbal irony in sheldon's statement. sheldon is employing sarcasm by equating a person to a machine that needs to ""power down"" on saturdays, implying this would be a negative aspect when in reality, most people welcome a day off. this ironic comparison and the absurdity of treating a person like a machine in this context clearly indicate that the statement is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0

 SHELDON: Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays.
 LEONARD: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of irony in sheldon's statement, presenting an absurd scenario of a trash can spontaneously forming around the letter, is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this is immediately followed by a reference to occam's razor to contrast the ridiculous suggestion with a more logical explanation. the juxtaposition of these elements creates a sarcastic tone, typical of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory"" where he often uses dry humor and sarcasm to highlight the obvious or critique others' actions.",1.0

 LEONARD: It goes with my corduroy suit.
 PENNY: If you mean it should end up in the same place, then I agree.
 PENNY: Is this your only tie?
",BBT,0,"based on the information provided and the content of the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward explanation or demonstration by leonard.
2. the tone is enthusiastic and excited, as indicated by the exclamation point.
3. there's no obvious irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm.
4. leonard seems to be genuinely pointing out a feature (reversibility) of something he's discussing.
5. the use of ""technically"" and the reversal of expectations doesn't appear to be sarcastic, but rather a way to build anticipation for the reveal of the reversible feature.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, there are no clear indicators of sarcastic intent in this brief dialogue. the statement appears to be a sincere, excited explanation of a technical feature.",0.0

 SHELDON: Hello Penny.

",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward, literal response from sheldon about a scientific publication. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the language, context, or style. the formal and precise nature of the statement, along with the specific reference to a scientific journal, aligns with what we might expect from a character like sheldon in a non-sarcastic context.",0.0

 PENNY: Get anything good?
 SHELDON: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

based on the available cues and the content of the input text, i believe this statement is likely sarcastic. here's why:

1. the use of the phrase ""that is so weird"" is often employed sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism rather than genuine surprise.

2. the verbal irony identified in the rhetorical devices cue suggests that penny doesn't actually find the situation weird, but is instead implying suspicion or doubt.

3. the contrast between ""yours came and mine didn't"" sets up a perfect scenario for sarcasm, where penny is likely implying that it's not actually a coincidence or strange occurrence.

4. the informal, conversational tone (with filler words like ""oh"" and ""you know"") is often used to deliver sarcastic comments in a casual manner.

5. without more context, it's difficult to be certain, but the combination of these elements strongly suggests that penny is being sarcastic about the situation, possibly implying that there's a reason why she didn't receive something while the other person did.",1.0

 HOWARD: Don't yell at me! I've got to go to the emergency room!
",BBT,1,"based on the information provided and the exaggerated, humorous comparison of a swollen tongue to a brisket, i can confidently assign the label:

",BBT,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""sell it on ebay as 'slightly used'"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of irony in describing something that is likely significantly damaged or destroyed as merely ""slightly used"" is a classic sarcastic technique. this understated description creates humor by deliberately misrepresenting the item's true condition, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0

 HOWARD: Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere.
 LEONARD: I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. while it starts with seemingly sincere advice to comfort someone, it takes an unexpected and inappropriate turn at the end with the crude suggestion to ""cop a feel."" this abrupt shift from seemingly caring advice to an objectifying and inappropriate comment is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially in the context of sitcom-style humor. the casual, blunt delivery of such contrasting ideas (comforting vs. sexual opportunism) further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assess that leonard's statement ""i think tonight was a very good start"" is not sarcastic. the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the cues indicate that this is a positive assessment of an evening's events.
2. the context suggests leonard is genuinely reflecting positively on something that occurred earlier.
3. the language used in the statement is straightforward and lacks any obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration or contradictory tone.

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward and sincere refusal by sheldon to attend a renaissance fair. the language is direct and formal, which is consistent with sheldon's character (assuming this is sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory""). there are no indicators of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm. the use of ""i'm sorry"" at the beginning of the sentence further reinforces the sincerity of the statement. therefore, this statement can be classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using exaggeration and absurd contrast to highlight what he perceives as unfair treatment. comparing the difficulty of getting a simple pen to needing wire cutters to steal from a bank is an obvious hyperbole, which is a common technique in sarcastic statements. the juxtaposition of someone else receiving an assistant while he struggles for basic supplies further emphasizes the sarcastic tone of his complaint.",1.0

this statement appears to be a straightforward, sincere expression of sheldon's personal boundary regarding his food. the tone is assertive and defensive, which is consistent with sheldon's character traits and his known aversion to people touching his food. the language is direct and lacks any ironic or exaggerated elements that would typically indicate sarcasm. given the context and sheldon's character, this is likely a genuine expression of his feelings about his personal space and food preferences, rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

the input text displays clear markers of sarcasm, particularly in the final exclamation ""on mars!"" this rhetorical question and exaggerated response to what was likely a genuine inquiry about location strongly indicates a sarcastic tone. the contrast between the realistic initial answer (near bakersfield) and the absurd suggestion of being on mars further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the statement. the informal, conversational style and the exasperated tone also support this classification.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the rhetorical analysis mentions that this could be interpreted as a sarcastic remark rather than a genuine inquiry.

2. the language style is described as colloquial and potentially implying frustration or annoyance, which often accompanies sarcasm.

3. the statement is phrased as a rhetorical question, a common device used in sarcastic expressions.

4. the suggestion of violence (punching in the face) is likely hyperbolic or exaggerated, which is another hallmark of sarcastic speech.

5. without full context, proposing violence as a solution often indicates frustration expressed through sarcasm rather than a genuine suggestion.

while sarcasm can sometimes be ambiguous without fuller context, the combination of these factors strongly suggests a sarcastic intent in this dialogue.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

the reason for this judgment is:

1. the tone of howard's comment appears to be mocking or teasing.
2. the use of ""bff"" (best friends forever) by an adult male character when referring to another adult male's friendship often carries a sarcastic connotation.
3. the quotation marks around ""dave"" suggest a dismissive or skeptical attitude towards this new person.
4. in the context of friend groups or sitcom dynamics, characters often react sarcastically to potential new friends who might disrupt the existing social balance.

the statement seems to imply that howard is not seriously suggesting leonard has a new best friend, but rather is making a sarcastic comment about leonard's interaction with someone named dave.",1.0

 SHELDON: It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and my analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the allusion to ""build her a bear"" (referencing build-a-bear workshop) is used as an absurd alternative to whatever activity they're currently engaged in. this sudden, seemingly out-of-place suggestion is a common sarcastic technique.

2. the informal and colloquial tone, combined with the abrupt shift from ""this stuff"" to building a bear, creates a comedic contrast that's typical of sarcastic remarks.

3. the implication that building a stuffed animal is a suitable alternative to their current activity (which someone doesn't like) is likely meant to be humorous and not a genuine suggestion, further indicating sarcasm.

4. the concise and direct nature of the statement, coupled with its unexpected content, aligns with common sarcastic delivery methods.

therefore, considering these factors, the statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a sincere suggestion.",1.0

 LEONARD: I know, I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text displays clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the statement ""a lot of words sound like 'yoga'"" is an exaggeration. in reality, very few words sound similar to ""yoga.""

2. leonard appears to be making an excuse for mishearing something, using an obviously weak justification.

3. the tone implies that leonard is likely aware he misheard but is using humor to deflect from his mistake.

4. the structure of the dialogue, with the pause indicated by the dash, suggests a comedic timing often used in delivering sarcastic remarks.

given these elements, particularly the exaggeration and the implied tone, this statement can be confidently labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

sarcastic

leonard's suggestion to ""lie down on the floor and swim there"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally. it's a sarcastic response, likely to someone complaining about swimming or expressing difficulty with it. the absurdity of swimming on the floor highlights the sarcastic tone, making this statement a clear example of sarcasm.",1.0

the statement uses irony to convey sarcasm. penny is clearly not enjoying the lack of power, but she phrases it as if the department of water and power did her a favor by creating an ""ambience"" (darkness due to no electricity). this juxtaposition of a negative situation (having utilities cut off) with positive language (""enjoy the ambience"") is a classic indicator of sarcasm.",1.0

explanation:
the statement ""kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?"" appears to be a genuine rhetorical question. the language style information indicates an informal, conversational tone that invites reflection on an emotional or sensory experience. the use of a rhetorical question here seems to be aimed at engaging the listener and prompting them to consider their own feelings, rather than conveying sarcasm. the lack of context that might contradict the surface meaning of the statement also supports a non-sarcastic interpretation. therefore, this statement is most likely meant sincerely and not sarcastically.",0.0

this response from sheldon is indeed sarcastic. the sarcasm is evident in the last part of his statement, where he refers to the current conversation as ""fairly pointless."" this shows his impatience and frustration with the interaction, implying that it's wasting his time when he has a task to complete.

sheldon's character is known for his direct and often socially inappropriate comments, and this line fits that pattern. he's not just stating facts about his estimated time; he's adding a biting commentary about the conversation itself, which is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

the precise time estimate (three hours, 11 minutes) contrasted with the vague and dismissive ""however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation"" adds to the sarcastic tone, highlighting sheldon's priorities and his disdain for what he perceives as an unnecessary delay.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the given context and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. penny's comment implies that there's a different meaning to ""coffee"" beyond its literal interpretation.
2. her use of ""that is so sweet"" in this context is not meant literally, but rather as a condescending or patronizing remark about the other person's naivety.
3. the cues indicate that penny finds the literal interpretation amusing or endearing, which aligns with a sarcastic tone.

explanation:
the statement appears to be a genuine suggestion or idea proposed by howard. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the text or the provided cues. the language is straightforward and the context suggests that howard is seriously considering this option, possibly as a way to make a significant life change or deal with a problem. the specific details about his cousin, her husband avi, and the location (israel) further support that this is a sincere, albeit perhaps unusual or sudden, proposition rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

 SHELDON: Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

the statement ""hardly a day goes by when i don't think about it"" appears to be a sincere expression of frequent thought about something significant to leonard. there are several reasons to believe this is not sarcastic:

1. the use of hyperbole (""hardly a day goes by"") is often used for emphasis in sincere statements, especially when expressing the significance or impact of something.

2. the formal register and negative construction suggest a serious tone rather than a sarcastic one.

3. the first-person perspective and present tense indicate personal, ongoing reflection, which is more consistent with a genuine statement than sarcasm.

4. there are no obvious contextual cues or exaggerated language that would typically signal sarcasm.

5. the statement expresses a consistent, habitual thought process, which is more likely to be sincere than sarcastic.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a genuine expression of leonard's frequent contemplation of something important to him, rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the information provided and the context of the dialogue, i believe the correct label for this input is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone of leonard's statement appears genuinely hesitant and conflicted, rather than sarcastic.
2. the use of ellipsis (...) indicates hesitation or uncertainty, which is more consistent with sincere concern than sarcasm.
3. leonard is expressing what seems to be a genuine worry about penny's feelings, which doesn't have the hallmarks of a sarcastic statement.
4. the informal, conversational tone suggests a straightforward expression of thoughts rather than a sarcastic remark.
5. there are no obvious cues or exaggerations that would typically indicate sarcasm in this context.

this statement exhibits classic hallmarks of sarcasm, including:

1. the mocking interjection ""ooh""
2. the ironic phrase ""big talk""
3. the humorous and absurd imagery of someone being ""treed by a chicken""

the speaker (raj) is clearly using sarcasm to mock or tease the person he's addressing, likely in response to that person making some kind of boastful claim. the contrast between the ""big talk"" and the embarrassing situation of being scared up a tree by a chicken is a typical sarcastic technique used to deflate someone's ego or point out hypocrisy.",1.0

the dialogue appears to be a straightforward exchange where leonard is being offered chocolate and firmly refusing it. there are no indicators of sarcasm in his response. the exclamation mark suggests emphasis or frustration, but not sarcasm. the repetition of ""chocolate"" and the direct nature of the refusal align with a sincere, non-sarcastic interaction.",0.0

explanation:
howard's response appears to be a straightforward, literal answer to a question about ""goth stuff."" he's simply listing examples of items associated with goth culture (magazines and music) without any apparent irony or sarcastic tone. the casual, informal language and the direct nature of the response suggest that howard is genuinely providing information rather than using sarcasm.",0.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. context: sheldon, a character known for his intelligence and often condescending attitude, is commenting on waitressing at the cheesecake factory.

2. exaggeration: he describes waitressing as a ""complex socio-economic activity"" that requires ""a great deal of analysis and planning."" this is a significant overstatement of the skills typically associated with waitressing.

3. contrast: there's a stark contrast between the simplicity of the job (waitressing) and the complex terms used to describe it (socio-economic analysis, planning).

4. tone: the use of ""obviously"" at the beginning sets a sarcastic tone, implying that what follows is anything but obvious or true.

5. knowledge of the source: if this is from the tv show ""the big bang theory,"" sheldon's character is known for making such sarcastic and condescending remarks, especially about jobs he considers beneath his intellect.

the sarcasm here lies in the deliberate mismatch between the job description and the overly complex way it's being described, likely to mock or belittle the occupation.",1.0
SHELDON: When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the Battlestar known as Galactica.,"LEONARD: When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?

sarcastic

this quote appears to be a humorous, absurdist line likely intended as a sarcastic joke, mixing sci-fi references with mundane objects in an incongruous way for comedic effect. the character sheldon seems to be deliberately using overwrought, dramatic phrasing about something as ordinary as toast, which is characteristic of sarcastic humor.",1.0

 SHELDON: How would you put it?
 LEONARD: Yeah, okay, like you said.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. contrast between formal and informal language: the use of the formal term ""intercourse"" alongside the more casual phrase ""awful lot of trouble"" creates a humorous juxtaposition that's characteristic of sarcasm.

2. understatement: describing the efforts for intimacy as ""an awful lot of trouble"" downplays the emotional and physical significance many people attribute to sex, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. character context: if this is sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" he's known for his socially awkward and often unintentionally humorous observations about human behavior, particularly regarding relationships and sex.

4. implied criticism: the statement subtly criticizes or questions the value of sexual intercourse by suggesting it's not worth the effort, which is likely meant to be taken ironically.

5. deadpan delivery: the matter-of-fact tone described in the cues is often used to deliver sarcastic comments for comedic effect.

given these factors, the statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic, poking fun at both the speaker's own lack of understanding and society's complex courtship rituals.",1.0

 HOWARD: No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line.
 LEONARD: Thank you!
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard's comment is a biting, humorous exaggeration that plays on stereotypes and makes a mocking jab at the person he's speaking to. here's why it's sarcastic:

1. the exaggerated timeframe of the ex getting a new boyfriend ""by tomorrow morning"" is unrealistically fast, emphasizing the perceived ease with which she might move on.

2. the contrast between the ex's quick rebound and the addressee's inability to get a new girlfriend is deliberately harsh and comedic.

3. the phrase ""when you figure out how to build one"" is particularly sarcastic. it implies that the person is so inept at relationships or unattractive that their only chance of getting a girlfriend is to literally construct one, which is obviously impossible and meant to be a cutting joke.

this kind of exaggerated, mocking humor is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially when it's used to point out someone's perceived shortcomings or make light of a potentially painful situation like a breakup.",1.0

the use of concession in this statement, acknowledging a negative aspect before highlighting a seemingly minor positive point, is a common sarcastic technique. the speaker appears to be sarcastically praising an insignificant element (the desert scenery) in the face of the movie's overall poor quality. this kind of exaggerated focus on a minor positive in contrast to a major negative is often employed in sarcastic comments.",1.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is comparing leonard's scientific work to a simple elementary school experiment in a way that's meant to belittle leonard's achievements. the use of ""nearly as amazing as"" followed by a description of a very basic science project (growing lima beans in wet paper towels) that even young children can do is a classic sarcastic structure. it's meant to imply that leonard's work is actually not impressive at all, which is the opposite of what the words literally say. this kind of exaggerated, insincere praise is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially coming from a character like sheldon who is known for his condescending attitude towards others' intelligence and accomplishments.",1.0

the input text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the understated way of describing leonard as ""a bit emotionally unstable"" when discussing heavy machinery operation suggests irony.

2. the casual tone used to discuss a potentially dangerous situation (operating heavy machinery) creates a humorous contrast.

3. the indirect characterization of leonard and the subtle implication about his state of mind contribute to the sarcastic tone.

4. the use of ""you don't want someone like that"" adds to the dry humor and sarcastic delivery.

given these elements and the cues provided about the informal tone, conversational style, and humor through understatement, this statement can be confidently labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm, as indicated by penny's exaggerated and mock-serious response about alien overlords. the cues correctly identify the use of sarcasm as the main rhetorical device, along with hyperbole to emphasize the absurdity. the context and tone of penny's statement strongly suggest she's not being literal, but rather using sarcasm to mock or humorously respond to someone else's behavior or statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of a rhetorical question, the implication, and the casual tone all contribute to a sarcastic delivery. penny is not genuinely asking about a new girlfriend or offering helpful relationship advice. instead, she's making a pointed, humorous jab, likely at someone's expense or in response to a situation where the person's current relationship may be in trouble.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the cues mention verbal irony, which is often a key component of sarcasm.
2. the abrupt ""you."" at the end contrasts with the initially polite tone, suggesting a sarcastic or confrontational shift.
3. the exaggerated politeness (""oh, i'm so glad"") followed by the short, blunt ""you."" creates a mismatch that is typical of sarcastic statements.
4. the structure of the sentence, starting with enthusiasm and ending abruptly, is a common sarcastic technique.

explanation:
while leonard's statement does contain some exasperation and possibly mild humor, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. he's directly expressing his desire to change the topic of conversation to something more relatable, using slightly dramatic language to emphasize his point. this seems to be a genuine request rather than a sarcastic comment. the phrasing ""vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet"" is hyperbolic, but it's used to underscore his frustration with the current topic, not to convey the opposite of what he means (which would be characteristic of sarcasm).",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this statement is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone is described as informal and conversational, which is typical for a genuine question.
2. while there's a hint of skepticism or confusion in howard's question, it doesn't clearly indicate sarcasm.
3. the question seems to be seeking clarification about someone's intentions rather than making a mocking or ironic statement.
4. without additional context that might suggest a sarcastic intent, it's safer to interpret this as a straightforward, albeit slightly puzzled, inquiry.

 PERSON: Hey.
 SHELDON: Hello.
 PERSON: Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.
 SHELDON: Yes.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. while the first part about einstein's 1917 paper is factually accurate, the last part is a humorous fabrication. it's extremely unlikely that einstein would have used the colloquial term ""bitchin'"" to describe his hopes for the laser, especially given:

1. the formal scientific context of his work
2. the time period (1917)
3. einstein's personality and manner of speaking

the juxtaposition of the formal, scientific information with the very casual, anachronistic slang term ""bitchin'"" creates a humorous contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm. this is likely a quote from the character sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory,"" known for his deadpan delivery of such sarcastic scientific quips.",1.0

based on the input text and the provided cues, this statement appears to be a straightforward, sincere expression of discomfort or embarrassment. howard is genuinely describing a situation that has made it difficult for him to face someone. the informal, conversational tone and the use of hedging phrases like ""kind of"" twice suggest he's trying to convey his feelings honestly rather than employing sarcasm. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would typically be present in sarcastic statements. therefore, the appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

this line appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement. sheldon is reluctantly agreeing to something after some apparent discussion or debate. the repetition of ""all right, all right"" suggests a tone of exasperation or concession rather than sarcasm. the statement ""he can buy his own desk"" is a direct permission or agreement, not an ironic or mocking comment that would indicate sarcasm. the context and language style point to a character giving in to a request or argument, but doing so sincerely, albeit reluctantly.",0.0

",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this statement is sarcastic. the use of the phrase ""cornucopia of social awkwardness"" is an exaggerated and humorous way to describe someone's frequent socially awkward behavior. the term ""cornucopia,"" which typically refers to an abundance of good things, is ironically applied to a negative trait (social awkwardness), creating a sarcastic tone. this kind of witty, exaggerated commentary is characteristic of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory,"" who often makes sarcastic observations about others' social behaviors.",1.0

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward, casual conversation between friends. amy is sharing personal information about menstrual synchronization and then abruptly changing the topic to inquire about a planned girls' night. while the sudden shift in topic and the mention of synchronized menstruation might seem unusual in some contexts, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the language is direct and informative, lacking the typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the conversation seems to reflect genuine information sharing and social planning among close female friends, which is consistent with the context and common knowledge provided in the cues.",0.0

while this statement might seem unusual or potentially humorous due to its candid nature and the use of the idiom ""to make a long story short"" when discussing a rather specific medical detail, there's no clear indication of sarcasm here. amy appears to be genuinely sharing a personal medical fact about herself in a straightforward, albeit casual, manner. the language used, including the medical terminology, suggests she's relaying actual information rather than making a sarcastic comment. therefore, based on the available cues and context, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

the text does not appear to be sarcastic. amy is genuinely responding to a dare by bernadette to tell a dirty story. she references ""the miller's tale"" by chaucer, which is indeed known for its bawdy content. her comment about sock drawers is a humorous exaggeration to emphasize how scandalous the story would have been considered, but it's not meant sarcastically. the overall tone is light-hearted and playful, but straightforward in its intent to share what amy considers a dirty story from classic literature.",0.0

 LEONARD: No, Penny kissed me.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this text is likely sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the exaggerated comparison: howard equates a potentially awkward romantic situation with accidentally kissing his mother, which is an unlikely and humorous exaggeration.

2. the use of humor: the comment about frequently accidentally kissing his mother on the lips is clearly meant to be funny and not taken literally.

3. the incongruity: the casual way howard compares a romantic mishap to interactions with his mother creates a comedic disconnect.

4. the absurdity of the frequency claim: saying this happens ""all the time"" with his mother is an obvious overstatement for comedic effect.

5. the context: this appears to be a response to a potentially embarrassing or awkward situation, and using sarcasm or humor is a common way to diffuse such tension.

the sarcastic tone is used here to lighten the mood and possibly make the other person feel less uncomfortable about the situation being discussed. it's a playful way of suggesting that the kiss might have been accidental while also poking fun at the situation.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement has a dismissive and condescending tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.
2. the character sheldon from ""the big bang theory"" is known for his sarcastic and often socially inappropriate comments.
3. the statement makes a sweeping generalization about where certain items (likely barbie dolls or similar toys) ""belong,"" which is an oversimplification that can be interpreted as sarcastic.
4. the use of ""where they belong"" at the end of the sentence adds a finality that emphasizes the sarcastic tone.
5. without full context, this statement appears to be a response to a question or discussion, and the abruptness and definitiveness of the answer suggest it's not meant to be taken entirely at face value.

3. the question ""why not you?"" seems to be a genuine consideration rather than a sarcastic retort.
4. there's no clear indication of irony or mocking tone that would typically accompany sarcasm.
5. the fragmentary nature of the response (""somebody bigger and..."") suggests the speaker is thinking through their response in real-time, which is more characteristic of sincere speech than prepared sarcasm.

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""obviously"" at the beginning is a strong indicator of sarcasm, especially when followed by an absurd statement.

2. the extreme and illogical jump from ""justice league"" to ""muppet baby costumes"" is deliberately ridiculous, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. the character sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his deadpan delivery of outlandish statements, often with sarcastic undertones.

4. the juxtaposition of the serious-sounding ""we have no choice"" with the childish concept of ""muppet baby costumes"" creates a humorous contrast typical of sarcasm.

5. the overall tone and content are exaggerated and not meant to be taken literally, which is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

this statement from raj appears to be sarcastic, particularly the first part where he says ""i'd like to raise two points."" the formality of this phrase contrasts humorously with the content that follows, which is quite informal and risqué. the emphasis on ""are"" in italics also suggests a playful or sarcastic tone. 

the second point about the mimosas ""kicking his little brown ass"" is a colloquial and humorous way of saying the drinks are affecting him strongly, which fits with the overall sarcastic and comedic tone of the statement.

the reason for this label is:

1. the phrase ""who would have thought it?"" is a common sarcastic expression used to imply surprise at something that the speaker actually considers obvious or expected.

2. the context of sheldon saying ""hey, you taught me something"" followed by this phrase suggests he's expressing mock surprise, implying that he didn't actually expect to learn anything from the other person.

3. this kind of dialogue is typical of sarcastic exchanges, where the speaker uses exaggerated surprise to subtly insult or belittle the other person's knowledge or ability to teach them something.

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. here's why:

1. context mismatch: penny starts with ""oh, yeah, yeah. it's real great,"" but then describes a situation that is clearly not great at all.

2. tone: the initial ""oh, yeah, yeah"" and ""it's real great"" are likely said in a sarcastic tone, given what follows.

3. unexpected twist: the stark contrast between expecting a cat food commercial audition and ending up at a porn audition is presented in a deadpan manner, which is often indicative of sarcasm.

4. brevity in describing the twist: the short, blunt statement ""turned out to be porn"" at the end enhances the sarcastic effect.

5. implied frustration: the sarcasm serves to express penny's frustration and disappointment with how her day went, without explicitly stating those feelings.

given these factors, the statement is clearly meant to be taken as sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by howard is clearly sarcastic. the vivid and exaggerated imagery, combined with the mocking tone and rhetorical question format, strongly indicate that howard is using sarcasm to express his disgust or discomfort with the situation he's describing. the phrase ""that's got to be fun for you, huh?"" is a classic sarcastic setup, implying the opposite of what is literally stated. the graphic description that follows further reinforces the sarcastic intent, using deliberately provocative language to emphasize howard's negative feelings about the situation.",1.0

 PENNY: Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?
 AMY: Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of a rhetorical question ""isn't it?"" at the end of the statement often implies sarcasm, especially when paired with an overly positive sentiment.
2. the phrase ""great time to be alive"" is quite emphatic and could be seen as exaggerated, which is a common feature of sarcastic statements.
3. without additional context, the statement seems too broad and generalized to be taken at face value, suggesting it might be a sarcastic comment on current events or circumstances.
4. the cues mention that this could be used sarcastically depending on the context, and given the lack of specific positive context, sarcasm seems more likely.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the surrounding conversation or situation, this interpretation is based on the typical use of such phrasing in sarcastic contexts.",1.0

 PENNY: Yeah, it was.
 BERNADETTE: Leonard's really one of a kind.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of ""heavy-handed"" suggests amy is criticizing someone's action as being too obvious or exaggerated.
2. the rhetorical question ""don't you think?"" at the end adds a sarcastic tone.
3. the context implies amy is commenting on someone's symbolic use of a snowflake, which she finds overly simplistic or cliché.
4. the informal, conversational tone and critical attitude are consistent with sarcastic expression.
5. the juxtaposition of a delicate object (snowflake) with the term ""heavy-handed"" creates irony, a common element in sarcasm.

these elements together strongly indicate that amy's statement is meant to be sarcastic, criticizing someone's attempt at symbolism or metaphor as being too obvious or lacking subtlety.",1.0

this text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. penny claims she's ""not concerned"" and doesn't ""have a problem,"" but then immediately makes a critical comment about leonard's new girlfriend wearing ""way too much makeup."" this contradiction is a classic sarcastic technique.

2. the exaggerated statement about renting her womb to a gay couple to afford cute items is an over-the-top joke that further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

3. the abrupt shift from relationship talk to shopping, combined with the extreme financial measure suggested, adds to the overall sarcastic and humorous tone of the statement.

4. the initial denial of being concerned, followed by specific comments that show she is indeed concerned, is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

 BERNADETTE: You guys ready to order?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i believe this dialogue is intended to be sarcastic or humorous. here's why:

1. unusual combination: sheldon requests a serious antibiotic (penicillin), a medication to induce vomiting (syrup of ipecac), and then casually adds ""a mint"" at the end. this juxtaposition of medical items with a trivial candy creates a comedic effect.

2. anticlimax: as noted in the rhetorical devices cue, the list ends with ""and a mint,"" which is an unexpected and humorous conclusion that contrasts with the seriousness of the other items.

3. context: the cues suggest this is likely part of a comedic scene in a tv show or movie, given the unusual combination of requests.

4. character behavior: the character sheldon appears to be making these requests in a setting where such a combination would be unusual (likely a pharmacy or doctor's office), which adds to the sarcastic or humorous tone.

5. delivery: the hesitation (""uh"") before mentioning the syrup of ipecac suggests a possibly exaggerated or deliberately awkward delivery, common in sarcastic or comedic dialogue.

while the individual requests might be sincere in isolation, the combination and delivery strongly suggest this is meant to be a sarcastic or humorous line rather than a genuine medical request.",1.0

 BERNADETTE: I don't understand.
",BBT,1,"based on the context provided and the character's exaggerated reaction to a relatively minor incident, i would label this text as:

sarcastic

the character sheldon is using hyperbole by suggesting that drinking from someone else's glass is so catastrophic that it would be memorialized on his tombstone. this dramatic overreaction to a small social faux pas is a classic example of sarcasm used for comedic effect.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard's comment about jewish mothers taking a ""casual, la-di-da approach to their sons"" is the opposite of the common stereotype, which portrays jewish mothers as being very involved and often overbearing in their sons' lives. the use of phrases like ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" in this context is deliberately contradictory to the widely recognized stereotype, indicating sarcasm.",1.0

 HOWARD: Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.
",BBT,0,"label: not sarcastic

this statement from sheldon appears to be a direct and honest admission of what happened, rather than a sarcastic comment. given sheldon's character (often literal and straightforward) and the context provided (accidentally swallowing some tequila while gargling), this statement is likely meant to be taken at face value. sheldon is probably genuinely reporting his unusual experience with tequila, which aligns with his typically inexperienced approach to alcohol and social norms. the use of ""teeny bit"" further emphasizes his attempt to downplay the amount, which is consistent with his character's tendency to be precise and possibly embarrassed by such a mishap.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward explanation or definition, likely from a dialogue or script.
2. sheldon is using a simile to describe an event by comparing it to a heart attack, which is a common way to explain something serious or sudden.
3. there are no obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory context.
4. the language is simple and direct, typical of sheldon's character (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory"" tv show) when he's explaining concepts.
5. without additional context that might suggest a sarcastic tone, it's most likely that this statement is meant to be taken literally as a sincere comparison or explanation.",0.0

the statement ""oh, yeah, that can only be good for you"" is clearly sarcastic. the speaker is implying the exact opposite of what they're saying - that the situation of a current girlfriend and an ex-girlfriend hanging out together is likely to be problematic or uncomfortable for the person involved, not ""good"" as stated. this aligns with the cues about the use of sarcasm to express that this situation is likely not beneficial for the person in question.",1.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. amy's comment about seeing someone as ""the face of hemorrhoids"" is not meant to be taken literally or as a compliment. it's a humorous and sarcastic remark, likely intended to tease or mock the person she's speaking to. the use of ""oh"" and the phrase ""i could so see you"" further emphasize the sarcastic tone. the context provided in the cues also supports this interpretation, noting the humorous and sarcastic nature of the comment.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. sheldon is creating a mock term ""dinfast date"" to tease leonard about his unconventional meal timing with priya.

2. he explicitly mentions ""peer-based mocking,"" indicating he's aware of the sarcastic nature of his comment.

3. the final quote, ""hey, leonard, how was your dinfast with priya last night?"" is a direct example of the sarcastic mockery sheldon is describing.

4. the overall tone and wordplay (dinner + breakfast = dinfast) are characteristic of sheldon's style of sarcasm in the big bang theory.

sarcastic

the use of understatement by howard in describing significant and expensive gifts as ""fun news"" strongly suggests a sarcastic tone. the contrast between the casual phrasing and the extravagance of the gifts (diamond earrings and a leased car) creates an ironic effect typical of sarcasm. howard's choice of words appears to be deliberately downplaying the situation, likely to emphasize how over-the-top or potentially concerning raj's behavior is in his relationship with emily.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is making an ironic comment about whispering around a deaf person, pointing out the absurdity of such an action. the sarcasm lies in the fact that whispering would make no difference to someone who can't hear, and howard's use of ""smart"" at the beginning is meant ironically. this comment also demonstrates insensitivity towards the deaf person, using sarcasm to highlight the inappropriate behavior of others.",1.0

the statement ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself"" exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it uses irony to point out hypocrisy, which is a common sarcastic technique.
2. the tone is accusatory and confrontational, typical of sarcastic remarks.
3. it employs a contrast between how one perceives others versus oneself, which is often used in sarcastic commentary.
4. the statement is concise and pointed, which is common in sarcastic delivery.
5. coming from a character named sheldon, who is often associated with dry wit and sarcasm in popular culture, it further supports the sarcastic interpretation.

1. the character sheldon is known for his dry, often sarcastic humor in popular media.

2. the use of understatement as a rhetorical device, describing what is likely a more dramatic reaction in deliberately understated terms (""slightly widened eyes of mildly startled""), creates a humorous effect typical of sarcasm.

3. the formal and precise language contrasts with the trivial nature of the observation, which is a common technique in sarcastic speech.

4. the analytical tone in describing a human emotional reaction suggests a detached, somewhat mocking attitude, which is often associated with sarcasm.

5. the phrase ""there's nothing quite like"" is often used sarcastically to point out something unremarkable or annoying, rather than genuinely praiseworthy.

",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement contains contrasting elements that are typical of sarcasm:

1. ""said horrible things about each other in public"" - this is generally considered negative behavior.
2. ""all in all, a pretty magical night"" - this positive conclusion contrasts sharply with the negative description that precedes it.

the juxtaposition of ""horrible things"" with ""magical night"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. leonard is using irony to describe a night that was likely unpleasant as ""magical,"" which is a classic sarcastic technique. the extracted keywords support this interpretation, highlighting the contrast between the negative (""horrible things"") and positive (""magical night"") elements of the statement.",1.0

",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and the content of penny's statement, i believe this comment is not sarcastic. while there's a slight possibility of mild irony in her tone, the overall context and delivery suggest a straightforward, sincere response to a change in new year's eve plans.

penny's use of ""hmm"" and ""that's too bad"" indicates genuine disappointment rather than sarcasm. her suggestion about waiting for the ball to drop seems to be a sincere alternative plan, even if it might not be the most exciting option.

the language is informal and typical of casual conversation, without any clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, obvious irony, or mocking tone. therefore, i conclude that this statement is not sarcastic, but rather a straightforward expression of mild disappointment and an attempt to suggest an alternative plan.",0.0
LEONARD: Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.,"LEONARD: It's 2:00 a.m. What are you doing up?
 SHELDON: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
",BBT,1,"given the context provided and the nature of the dialogue, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the line ""you want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year"" is likely meant to be humorous and sarcastic. it plays on the stereotype that scientists are not typically known for their fashion sense, and the idea of attending a scientific conference to see what scientists are wearing is inherently amusing. the casual tone and the setup (with leonard's name indicating this is likely from a sitcom script, possibly ""the big bang theory"") further support the sarcastic interpretation of this line.",1.0

 PERSON: Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser.
And now we're reversed.
 PERSON: You're the winner.
",BBT,1,"based on the given context and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's using irony to criticize someone who is supposedly successful (""a winner"") but can't perform a simple task like making cocoa. the contrast between the person's perceived success and their inability to make cocoa is a classic sarcastic setup, implying that their success might be overrated or undeserved. sheldon's character is known for his sarcastic and often condescending remarks, which further supports this interpretation.",1.0

 PENNY: Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
 SHELDON: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears.
 SHELDON: I don't know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.
 PENNY: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the character sheldon is dismissing an important achievement in biology by reducing it to ""yucky, squishy things,"" which is an intentionally childish and reductive way to describe a scientific field.

2. the contrast between acknowledging that the news ""sounded important"" and then immediately dismissing it based on personal bias is a classic sarcastic structure.

3. the condescending tone and the way sheldon explains this as if it's obvious (""oh, i see why you're confused"") adds to the sarcastic nature of the statement.

4. this kind of statement aligns with sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory,"" who often uses sarcasm to express his biases against fields he considers inferior to his own.

the sarcasm here lies in the absurdity of dismissing an entire scientific field and its achievements based on a juvenile perception, especially when coming from a character who is supposed to be highly intelligent and scientific.",1.0
"SHELDON: No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.","SHELDON: I don't think there's anything in this jewelry store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.

 SHELDON: Ooh, a pocket watch.
 PENNY: Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the statement seems out of place and unexpected in a modern context, as pocket watches are not typically considered a desirable trait in men today.

2. the character sheldon (likely from a tv show or similar media) is known for making socially awkward or unconventional statements, often with unintentional humor.

3. the use of ""maybe"" suggests a speculative tone that could be interpreted as mock seriousness.

4. the juxtaposition of a seemingly antiquated item (pocket watch) with modern dating preferences creates a humorous contrast, which is a common element in sarcastic statements.

5. the cues suggest this is likely a humorous or sarcastic remark about dating preferences or attractiveness, which aligns with a sarcastic interpretation.

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that this statement is meant to be taken sarcastically rather than literally.",1.0
"LEONARD: Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?","PENNY: That was a really nice dinner.

 PENNY: You sure you just don't miss the sex?
",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reason for this label is:

1. the context suggests this is a playful or joking comment.
2. leonard's question ""have you ever tried it?"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally, as it's absurd to ask someone if they've tried having sex with themselves.
3. this kind of rhetorical question with an obvious answer is a common sarcastic device.
4. the statement plays on the ambiguity of ""it"" - first referring to sex with the other person, then jokingly implying sex with oneself.

the sarcasm here is gentle and playful, likely used to create humor in the conversation about their sexual relationship.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm through its use of deliberate misspellings, baby talk, and the juxtaposition of childish speech patterns with adult content. the speaker is using these rhetorical devices to create a humorous and ironic effect, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the contrast between the infantile language and the mature subject matter (taking pictures for craigslist) further emphasizes the sarcastic tone of the statement.",1.0

 LEONARD: This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
 PENNY: Okay, you're kind of really great.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. the comparison of neck massages to an eagle's grip is an exaggerated, humorous metaphor.
2. the question format implies a rhetorical tone, often used in sarcastic statements.
3. the contrast between a massage (typically associated with relaxation) and the violent imagery of an eagle's attack creates irony.
4. the name ""leonard:"" at the beginning suggests this is part of a dialogue, where sarcasm is often employed for comedic effect.

these factors strongly indicate that the statement is meant to be sarcastic, likely criticizing someone's poor massage technique in a humorous way.",1.0

 HOWARD: No
 RAJ: Okay, um... how about ""Crash""? 
Howard ""Crash"" Wolowitz.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. howard's statement is not meant to be taken literally. he's using irony to point out how inappropriate and potentially dangerous it would be for an astronaut to have the nickname ""crash."" the sarcasm is evident in the contrast between the positive words ""terrific"" and ""love"" with the obviously undesirable scenario of space travel with someone known for crashing. this juxtaposition creates a humorous and sarcastic tone.",1.0

 AMY: Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.
",BBT,0,"label: sarcastic

this statement is sarcastic because:

1. it's using the common misconception about einstein failing math, which we know is false based on the provided cues.

2. the character sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory"") is known for being highly intelligent and arrogant. by comparing himself to einstein and using a false ""fact"" to justify his perceived lack of challenge, he's employing sarcasm to emphasize his own intelligence.

3. the statement implies that sheldon's potential underperformance is due to being too smart for the material, rather than any actual shortcoming, which is a sarcastic way of deflecting criticism or explaining away poor results.

4. the use of a well-known (but incorrect) anecdote about a famous genius to explain personal academic performance is a classic form of sarcastic self-aggrandizement.",1.0

 SHELDON: Locus coeruleus.
 AMY: You're getting warmer-- it is, indeed, in the brain.
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the context provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

explanation:
the text contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the exaggerated praise: ""i'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you"" is likely not sincere given the difficult nature of the task described.

2. the contrast between the extreme precision required (""width of a single hair"") and the dismissive tone (""this is just biology"") creates irony.

3. the phrase ""hope your hands are steady"" followed by describing an incredibly precise task implies doubt about the person's ability to perform it, which is then contradicted by calling them a ""genius.""

these elements combine to create a sarcastic tone, where the speaker is likely expressing doubt or criticism about someone's ability to perform a delicate biological task while outwardly appearing to praise or encourage them.",1.0

 AMY: We're going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
 PENNY: Well, what about Bernadette?
",BBT,0,"based on the analysis of the cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of hyperbole in the statement ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm. this exaggeration is used to mock the idea of the speaker's supposed superiority or importance within the social group. the sarcastic tone is further reinforced by the dismissive opening phrase ""oh, screw her,"" which sets a negative and potentially insincere tone for the entire statement. the sarcasm here is likely being used to express frustration or criticism towards the person being discussed, while also potentially mocking the speaker's own perceived social status.",1.0

 LEONARD: Sheldon, be nice.
",BBT,0,"based on the analysis provided in the cues and the context of the input dialogue, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by sheldon is clearly meant to be humorous and self-deprecating. the idea that a hairstyle could give someone a ""bad boy attitude"" is an exaggeration, especially coming from a character like sheldon who is typically known for being anything but a ""bad boy"". this kind of ironic self-description is a classic example of sarcasm used for comedic effect in sitcom dialogue.",1.0

 HOWARD: Kangaroo, uh, I'd be Kanga-Jew.
 HOWARD: The first of my people to dunk a basketball.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the text displays clear markers of sarcasm:

1. exaggeration/hyperbole: leonard suggests an absurdly extreme alternative to living in one's mother's house by proposing living inside her body. this exaggeration is a common sarcastic technique.

2. unexpected twist: the statement starts with a seemingly normal premise (living in a mother's house) but then takes an unexpected and ridiculous turn, which is characteristic of sarcastic humor.

3. absurdist humor: the suggestion is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating a sarcastic intent.

4. tone: the blunt, matter-of-fact delivery of such an absurd idea implies a deadpan sarcastic tone.

5. context: while we don't have the full context, this type of statement is typical of sitcom-style sarcastic banter, especially given it's attributed to a character (leonard).

given these factors, the statement is clearly intended to be sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

 PERSON: Yeah, nice speech, Francine.
 RAJ: I'm not done, but thank you.

",BBT,0,"based on the content and context provided, i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the juxtaposition of ""good times"" with highly inappropriate or uncomfortable revelations.
2. the escalation from a relatively harmless secret (addiction to pedicures) to a shocking and taboo confession (losing virginity to a cousin).
3. the casual tone used to deliver such personal and potentially scandalous information.

the sarcasm here likely stems from raj ironically referring to these awkward and disturbing revelations as ""good times,"" when in reality, such a conversation would typically be extremely uncomfortable and far from a positive bonding experience.",1.0

explanation:
the statement by howard contains clear elements of sarcasm, particularly in the hyperbolic phrase ""let my life flash before my eyes."" this is an exaggerated way of expressing a desire to be left alone and reflect, typically associated with near-death experiences rather than simply sitting quietly. the dramatic nature of this statement, contrasted with the casual setup of the conversation, indicates a sarcastic tone. howard is likely using this exaggerated language to emphasize his desire for solitude and possibly to express frustration or stress in a darkly humorous way.",1.0

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. contrast between extraordinary and mundane: sheldon is comparing talking to someone in space (an extraordinary event) with talking to someone at a local coffee shop (a mundane occurrence).

2. exaggeration: the implication that without specific sound effects, a conversation with an astronaut is indistinguishable from a local chat is an exaggerated statement.

3. frustration and criticism: sheldon's tone suggests frustration with the lack of expected audio cues, criticizing the authenticity of the experience.

4. absurdity: the idea that walkie-talkie static is necessary to validate a conversation with someone in space is inherently absurd and humorous.

5. expectation subversion: one would expect talking to someone in space to be inherently exciting, but sheldon's comment subverts this expectation by focusing on a trivial audio detail.

the statement by leonard is a clear example of sarcasm. he's using childish language (""boom-boom in the potty"") to mock and belittle what is presumably a significant scientific achievement worthy of a nobel prize. this creates a stark and humorous contrast between the prestigious nature of the nobel prize and the trivial act of a child's toilet training, which is the essence of the sarcastic comment.",1.0

sarcastic

the text demonstrates clear sarcastic elements, particularly through the clever wordplay and unexpected twist in howard's response. the juxtaposition of ""under the weather"" (a common idiom for being ill) with ""under my dentist"" creates a humorous and sarcastic effect, implying a sexual encounter in a roundabout way. this kind of clever linguistic play is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially in sitcom-style dialogue. the informal tone and use of euphemism further support the sarcastic intent of the statement.",1.0

 RAJ: So you're wandering all around by yourself?

",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. irony: howard claims they don't seek glory and fame, but his statement itself seems designed to draw attention.

2. exaggeration: referring to themselves as ""space cowboys"" is an over-the-top way to describe their work.

3. false modesty: claiming they don't do it for glory while simultaneously elevating their status above other celebrities.

4. unexpected comparison: lumping together diverse groups like rock stars, athletes, and ""howie mandels"" creates a humorous effect.

5. the overall tone and structure of the statement is clearly meant to be humorous rather than sincere.

these elements strongly indicate that the statement is sarcastic in nature, using humor to actually highlight their desire for recognition while pretending to dismiss it.",1.0

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

the statement ""that sounds a little funny to an american ear"" is a straightforward observation about how something might sound unusual or strange to someone familiar with american english. there's no indication of sarcasm in this comment. it's simply noting a cultural or linguistic difference without any apparent irony or mocking tone. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

the message appears to be a genuine compliment to stuart about his comic book store. the phrase ""out of this world"" is used as hyperbole to express how impressive or extraordinary the store is. the comparison to ""the guy in this picture"" (which we can't see) seems to reinforce this positive sentiment. the tone is friendly and direct, without any obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony. therefore, based on the text and available context, this comment is most likely not sarcastic, but a sincere compliment.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of sheldon's genuine belief about wil wheaton's status as a minor celebrity. the context provided aligns perfectly with the content of sheldon's statement, indicating that he sincerely considers wil wheaton to be recognizable to many people once his identity is explained. there are no apparent contradictions or exaggerations that would suggest sarcasm. sheldon's character is known for his literal and direct communication style, which further supports the interpretation that this statement is meant to be taken at face value.",0.0

 HOWARD: I know. 
It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her.
 BERNADETTE: That's a lot for a kid to deal with.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this text appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the tone is exaggerated and self-aggrandizing, with howard claiming he was ""the only person"" who could cheer her up.

2. the punchline at the end, mentioning ""ben and jerry"" (the ice cream brand) alongside himself, creates a humorous contrast that undermines his initial claim.

3. the casual way howard talks about someone's persistent sadness and his ability to fix it suggests he might not be taking the situation as seriously as he claims.

4. the use of the well-known ice cream brand as a comforting agent is a common trope, often used in a lighthearted or sarcastic manner when discussing emotional situations.

the combination of these elements, particularly the self-importance followed by the ice cream reference, strongly suggests that howard is being sarcastic about his ability to cheer up the person in question, likely poking fun at himself or the situation.",1.0

the statement is humorous and alludes to an embarrassing personal anecdote, but it doesn't contain sarcasm. penny is genuinely expressing a quirky, lasting reaction to a past incident involving crayons. the tone is more self-deprecating and comedic rather than sarcastic. the informal, conversational style and use of imagery contribute to the humor, but there's no apparent irony or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm.",0.0

label: sarcastic

this conclusion is supported by several factors:

1. the noted ""slightly sarcastic or critical tone"" in the analysis.
2. the exasperated manner of speaking attributed to sheldon.
3. the phrase ""it's like you're not even trying to get better"" is a classic sarcastic construction, implying disappointment or frustration through an exaggerated statement.
4. the character sheldon, likely referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory,"" is known for his sarcastic and often condescending remarks.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that this dialogue is intended to be sarcastic, fitting the ""sarcastic"" label.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the current cues provided and the context of the input, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this response is likely sarcastic because:

1. it references the star trek catchphrase ""beam me up, scotty"" in a dismissive or mocking tone.
2. it's typically used humorously to express a desire to leave an unpleasant situation, implying that the current situation is frustrating or undesirable.
3. the phrasing as a suggestion (""why don't you..."") adds to the sarcastic tone, as if sarcastically proposing an impossible solution to a problem.

the use of this pop culture reference in this context strongly suggests a sarcastic intent rather than a literal suggestion.",1.0

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward description of a small gathering related to a work bonus. howard is explaining the attendees of the event in a matter-of-fact manner. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the use of colloquial language (like ""big wigs"") is casual but not inherently sarcastic. the context and tone seem to be informative and literal rather than sarcastic or mocking.",0.0

the input text is clearly an example of sarcasm. raj's question ""what, did he use a forklift?"" is not meant to be taken literally. instead, it's a sarcastic remark implying that the person being dumped is extremely heavy, which is intended as a mocking or critical comment. this aligns perfectly with the cue provided about the use of sarcasm and exaggerated imagery in this statement.",1.0

this statement does not appear to be sarcastic. leonard is expressing his genuine preferences and discomfort about public displays of emotion. he's being straightforward about being okay with surprises in general, but setting a clear boundary about not wanting anything done on a jumbotron. the mention of not wanting to cry on a big screen seems to be a sincere concern rather than a sarcastic comment. the language is casual and direct, which aligns with honest expression rather than sarcasm.",0.0

the text displays clear markers of sarcasm, particularly in bernadette's final sentence. the phrase ""i just had the decency to wait for him to leave"" is a sarcastic comment implying that she's more considerate than others for waiting to voice what everyone was already thinking. this creates a humorous contrast between her perceived politeness and the fact that she's still gossiping about someone who just left. the overall tone, combined with the situational irony and the casual suggestion of discussing something at red lobster immediately after someone's departure, strongly indicates a sarcastic intent.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the response from bernadette exhibits clear sarcastic undertones. the situation described (being stuck behind a bus and not going around it) is presented as an unlikely reason for someone to find charm in another person. the final sentence, ""i'm sure she finds it charming,"" is a classic example of sarcasm where the literal meaning is the opposite of what's actually meant. bernadette is implying that this behavior is not at all charming, but rather frustrating or unappealing.

the use of punctuation, particularly the question marks and the period at the end, also helps to convey the sarcastic tone, emphasizing bernadette's disbelief and mock certainty.",1.0

sarcastic

the response from amy contains clear sarcastic elements:

1. she's using a metaphorical expression (""losing my virginity"") in an unexpected context, subverting its usual meaning.
2. there's a humorous mismatch between the dramatic phrasing and the actual situation of watching a movie for the first time.

sarcastic

the response ""it was very entertaining... despite the glaring story problem"" contains clear sarcastic elements. the ellipsis and the contrast between ""very entertaining"" and ""glaring story problem"" suggest a sarcastic tone. the speaker is likely using irony to criticize the entertainment piece, emphasizing that a major flaw (the ""glaring story problem"") undermines its overall entertainment value. this aligns with the cue about discussing entertainment that was enjoyable but had a noticeable issue with its plot or narrative.",1.0

the context and phrasing strongly suggest this line is intended to be sarcastic or humorous. the juxtaposition of the grandiose phrase ""brave new world"" with what appears to be a reference to using the bathroom creates a comedic effect. additionally, the somewhat condescending use of ""little lady"" adds to the sarcastic tone. while sheldon may indeed be feeling relief, the way it's expressed is clearly meant to be funny rather than sincere, making this statement sarcastic in nature.",1.0

reasoning:

2. sheldon is making a clear distinction between ""bothering"" and ""talking,"" which appears to be a genuine clarification rather than a sarcastic remark.
3. the language style is straightforward and lacks typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, mock enthusiasm, or obviously false statements.
4. the parallelism in the sentence structure emphasizes the contrast between the two actions, which seems to be a sincere attempt to explain his intentions.

this label is appropriate because:

1. the context suggests this is dialogue from a comedic tv show, likely ""the big bang theory"" featuring the character sheldon cooper.

2. sheldon's assertion ""i'm really good at this"" followed immediately by asking for a hint is inherently contradictory and humorous, indicating sarcasm.

3. the overly specific and awkwardly phrased question about ""difficulty initiating a stream of anything"" is likely an attempt at humor through sheldon's characteristic social awkwardness and tendency to be overly technical.

4. the repetition of ""no, no, no"" at the beginning adds to the comedic timing and tone of the dialogue.

5. the cues mention a ""comedic tone"" and ""awkward but direct manner"" which aligns with the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

therefore, considering the context, character, and delivery of the line, this dialogue can be confidently labeled as sarcastic.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the dialogue appears to be a straightforward attempt by sheldon to change the subject of conversation.
2. mentioning an unusual skill like yodeling is consistent with sheldon's character (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory""), who often shares random facts about himself.
3. there are no clear linguistic markers of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
4. the statement is presented as a genuine question and fact, rather than a sarcastic comment.

1. the question ""what do you think i was gonna do at home?"" appears to be a straightforward inquiry without any obvious sarcastic undertones.
2. the language analysis indicates it's an informal, colloquial question, which is common in non-sarcastic everyday speech.
3. there are no clear rhetorical devices or figurative language that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the context is limited, but the question doesn't seem to convey any irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm.
5. without additional context that might indicate otherwise, it's safer to interpret this as a genuine question rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the context information and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
howard's statement is clearly sarcastic. the first part about picking up a cake or pie seems like a normal, thoughtful suggestion. however, the second part, ""but an insult to her faith is always thoughtful,"" is an obvious use of sarcasm. 

the juxtaposition of suggesting an insult as a thoughtful gesture is a classic sarcastic technique. howard is likely making a joke about how inappropriate and contrary to actual thoughtfulness it would be to insult someone's faith. this aligns with the context information that mentions the tone appears to be sarcastic or humorous.

the sarcasm here serves to highlight the absurdity of considering an insult to someone's faith as a thoughtful gesture, which makes it clear that howard is not seriously suggesting this course of action.",1.0

 RAJ: I can't tell you that.

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. penny is not seriously suggesting that there might be clues inside a beer in the fridge. instead, she's using humor to imply that she wants to drink a beer, disguising it as part of an investigation or search for clues. the absurdity of finding clues inside a beer bottle, combined with the casual tone and context provided, strongly indicates this is a sarcastic quip rather than a genuine suggestion.",1.0

 RAJ: Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored.
",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the speaker (penny) is making a humorous and exaggerated comparison between her current state and potential future effects of aging.

2. the use of contrasts (""isn't flat"" and ""not saggy"") against stereotypical aging concerns creates a comedic effect.

3. the final statement ""so far, the future's great"" is an ironic conclusion based on superficial criteria, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

4. the overall tone is lighthearted and playful, using physical attributes (beer and body parts) as a humorous way to comment on aging.

5. the brevity and punch of the statement, along with the setup and punchline structure, are consistent with sarcastic quips.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to make a point about aging in a humorous way, rather than making a sincere statement about her satisfaction with the future.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of a loaded question with an exaggerated and absurd assumption (""demented sex pervert"") is a clear indicator of sarcasm in this context. sheldon's character is known for making hyperbolic and socially inappropriate statements, often for comedic effect. this line fits that pattern perfectly, using sarcasm to create humor through an outrageous and unjustified accusation framed as a question.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward piece of dialogue, likely from a script or fictional conversation.
2. the language is direct and concise, without any obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration or irony.
3. penny's question ""so, why do you think that?"" seems to be a genuine inquiry for more information, not a sarcastic remark.
4. the phrase ""let the dead man talk"" could be literal in a supernatural or crime-related context, rather than sarcastic.
5. the punctuation and language style suggest a serious tone rather than a mocking or sarcastic one.

while the content is unusual (referring to a dead man talking), the delivery doesn't indicate sarcasm. instead, it appears to be a serious, albeit potentially dramatic or supernatural, conversation.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by howard is clearly intended to be sarcastic. he's not genuinely suggesting ""exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat"" as a serious career option. the phrasing and context strongly suggest this is a mocking or sarcastic comment, likely made in response to someone's job search or career discussion. the use of ""exciting opportunities"" paired with the somewhat insulting description of ""old and fat"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone of the statement.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the use of aposiopesis (trailing off with ""you and..."") followed by the abrupt ""oh, sure"" strongly suggests a sarcastic tone. the character seems to be proposing something and then immediately dismissing it with a sarcastic agreement, indicating they don't actually mean it sincerely. this kind of self-interruption and sudden shift in tone is often indicative of sarcasm in dialogue.",1.0

sarcastic

this dialogue is clearly sarcastic. sheldon's response is an exaggerated and mocking reaction to someone's suggestion (likely about a relationship progression). he uses rhetorical questions and escalating scenarios (engagement, house, family, sunset years) to express his disbelief and disapproval in a highly sarcastic manner. the final exclamation ""do you hear yourself, woman?!"" further emphasizes his sarcastic and emotional outburst.",1.0

the statement contains clear elements of sarcasm, particularly in the personification of sauvignon blanc (a type of wine) and the implied contrast between how someone treats people versus how they treat wine. the speaker, amy, is using irony to comment on the situation, suggesting that the person in question shows more respect or gentleness to their wine than to the people they're arguing with. this kind of humorous, indirect criticism is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.",1.0

based on the cues provided and the content of the statement, i believe this statement is not sarcastic. here's why:

1. the language is direct and emphatic, suggesting genuine sentiment rather than irony.
2. the statement aligns with what we might expect from a character named howard who is passionate about comic books.
3. there are no obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration or contradictory context.
4. the use of ""that's how much... means to me"" is typically used to express sincere importance.
5. without additional context suggesting otherwise, it's reasonable to interpret this as a straightforward expression of how meaningful buying a comic book store is to howard.

therefore, i conclude that this statement is not sarcastic, but rather a sincere expression of howard's feelings about purchasing a comic book store.",0.0

 PENNY: Oh, that's so sweet.
I mean, look at you-- you are gorgeous.
",BBT,0,"based on the context provided and the content of raj's statement, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
raj's comment appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the compliment about both women being ""gorgeous"" is immediately followed by a loaded implication about their shared intimate partner, which undercuts the sincerity of the initial compliment.

2. the phrase ""kind of says something about the man"" is deliberately vague and open to interpretation, but in this context, it's likely meant as a backhanded compliment or subtle insult to both the women and the man in question.

3. the juxtaposition of a seemingly polite observation with a more provocative comment about their sexual history suggests raj is not being entirely sincere or straightforward.

4. in social situations, bringing up shared sexual partners is often considered inappropriate or tactless, which further suggests raj is intentionally being provocative or sarcastic rather than genuinely complimentary.

the use of punctuation, particularly the double hyphen (--) to create a pause, adds to the sarcastic tone by separating the initial compliment from the more pointed follow-up comment.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of hyperbole in raj's statement, exaggerating the impact of bernadette leaving robotics, is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the phrase ""really took a hit"" is an overstatement meant to humorously emphasize bernadette's importance to the field, which is characteristic of sarcastic remarks.",1.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is likely intended to be sarcastic. the casual, blunt way penny references a rather risqué situation (getting out of a car without underwear) as if it's a common, everyday occurrence for everyone is the key to the sarcasm. it's an exaggeration used for humorous effect, not meant to be taken literally. the phrase ""same as all of us"" especially contributes to the sarcastic tone by falsely implying this is a universal experience when it clearly isn't.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. it presents an absurd and unexpected image of a renowned scientist (neil degrasse tyson) in a sexualized context typically associated with car advertisements or calendars. the humor comes from the incongruity between tyson's serious, intellectual public persona and this ridiculous scenario. the sarcasm is used to make a point about inappropriate or undesired imagery, likely in contrast to something mentioned earlier in the conversation. the tone and content strongly indicate this is a sarcastic joke, likely from a sitcom or comedy show.",1.0

label: sarcastic

this judgment is based on several factors:

1. the use of ""wow"" as an interjection often signals sarcasm, especially when combined with other cues.

2. the reference to ""went where no man has gone before"" is a well-known star trek quote, which is being used out of its original context. this misapplication of a familiar phrase is a common sarcastic technique.

3. the informal tone and brevity of the statement are consistent with delivering a sarcastic remark.

4. without additional context, the statement seems to be making light of or mocking someone's actions by hyperbolically comparing them to a grand space exploration feat.

these elements combined strongly suggest that howard is not sincerely praising someone's actions, but rather making a sarcastic comment about them.",1.0

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of interest or appreciation for an object, regardless of whether it's a tribble (a reference to star trek) or a toupee. the speaker finds the object ""pretty cool"" either way, which suggests sincerity rather than sarcasm. the tone is casual and lighthearted, but not mocking or ironic. therefore, based on the content and style of the statement, i would classify this as not sarcastic.",0.0

sarcastic

the use of euphemism, repetition, understatement, and circumlocution in leonard's response creates a tone of mild sarcasm. he's clearly trying to describe a potentially awkward or sensitive situation in an indirect and somewhat playful manner, which is characteristic of sarcastic speech. the phrase ""awfully flirty"" in particular has a sarcastic edge to it, downplaying what might be a more serious situation.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement exhibits clear markers of sarcasm, particularly:

1. the use of exaggeration: the speaker suggests an unlikely and specific scenario (the item being ""balled up in the corner of a barn"") rather than a more reasonable assumption about its whereabouts or condition.

2. the contrast between the initial surprise (""wow, you still have it?"") and the following absurd assumption, which creates a humorous effect typical of sarcastic comments.

3. the informal and playful tone, combined with the unexpected and somewhat ridiculous imagery, strongly indicates a sarcastic intent rather than a genuine belief or statement.

these elements align with the cues provided, especially the observation of ""sarcasm or playful exaggeration"" and the overall conversational and informal tone of the text. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate classification for this statement.",1.0

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and analysis of the text, this statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment from sheldon. the language is casual and uses common idioms, but there's no indication of irony or sarcasm. sheldon is simply expressing the practical idea of being prepared for future situations when he might be in a hurry. the phrase ""have a few in the bank"" is used literally to mean having something saved up or prepared in advance, which aligns with the overall context of planning ahead. there are no contradictory elements or exaggerated tones that would suggest sarcasm, so the most appropriate label for this statement is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
SHELDON: I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.,"LEONARD: Okay, why?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear sarcasm. here's why:

1. irony: sheldon's statement is ironic because snoring is typically considered disruptive to sleep, yet he's implying he needs it to sleep.

2. exaggeration: by saying he wonders how he'll ""ever sleep without it,"" sheldon is exaggerating his dependence on the snoring sound, which is unlikely to be true.

3. context: in most relationships or living situations, complaining about someone's snoring is common. sheldon's statement flips this expectation on its head for comedic effect.

4. tone: the phrasing suggests a dry, deadpan delivery typical of sarcastic comments.

5. implied criticism: while on the surface it might seem like a compliment, it's actually a subtle way of pointing out the person's loud snoring.

this combination of irony, exaggeration, and unexpected framing of a typically annoying habit as something desirable strongly indicates that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.",1.0

not sarcastic

the conversation appears to be a straightforward, casual dialogue without clear markers of sarcasm. while there is a touch of humor in amy's comment about syrup on her dashboard, it doesn't seem to be sarcastic in nature. rather, it's a lighthearted observation about a messy situation, delivered in a matter-of-fact way. the overall tone and context don't suggest sarcasm, but rather a normal, slightly humorous conversation.",0.0

It's a trap.
 BERNADETTE: So there<i> are</i> things you don't like.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of exaggerated metaphor: howard compares being in a conversation to being trapped and considering chewing his leg off to escape, which is a hyperbolic and sarcastic way of expressing frustration.

2. the context implies frustration: howard's statement suggests he feels stuck in an unwanted conversation, and he's using sarcasm to express his desire to leave.

3. the structure of the statement: the progression from ""and here i am in the trap"" to the extreme ""i'm gonna chew my leg off"" is a common sarcastic technique of escalating the situation for dramatic effect.

4. tone implication: while we can't hear the tone, the words chosen strongly imply a sarcastic delivery, especially with the middle sentence ""you just keep talking"" sandwiched between the trap metaphor and the leg-chewing hyperbole.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" best fits this dialogue.",1.0

 BERNADETTE: Uh-huh.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this statement. here's why:

1. the phrase ""and i love that..."" is often used sarcastically to express frustration or dissatisfaction with a situation.

2. the content of the statement describes an unfair distribution of responsibilities (working, doing all the cleaning) which is unlikely to be genuinely loved by most people.

3. the addition of ""and you're okay with that"" at the end implies criticism of the other person's acceptance of this imbalanced situation.

4. this statement aligns with the cues provided about household labor division and relationship dynamics, suggesting an imbalance that bernadette is likely criticizing through sarcasm.

the tone and content strongly indicate that bernadette is not sincerely expressing love for this arrangement, but rather using sarcasm to highlight her dissatisfaction with the unfair distribution of responsibilities in the relationship.",1.0

sarcastic

sheldon's comment about a surgeon letting a barn spider lay eggs in someone's nose is an extreme and absurd exaggeration that is clearly not meant to be taken literally. this kind of hyperbole is a common feature of sarcasm. additionally, the context mentions that sheldon appears to be exaggerating or being overly cautious about unlikely scenarios, which further supports the sarcastic nature of his statement.",1.0

2. the language style is described as informal and colloquial, which is typical for straightforward dialogue.
3. there are no rhetorical devices noted that might suggest sarcasm.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided input and cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""i'll catch you guys later"" is a common, casual farewell phrase. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the cues describe it as informal and friendly, which aligns with a straightforward, non-sarcastic goodbye. without any additional context that might imply a sarcastic tone or contradictory situation, this appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic statement from chandler as he's leaving a social situation.",0.0
MONICA: Really?,"MONICA: Honey the Miami vice sound track?
",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context provided in the input ""monica: really?"", it's not possible to definitively determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the word ""really?"" can be used both sincerely and sarcastically, depending on the tone and context of the conversation.

however, based on the common usage of ""really?"" in dialogue, i can make an educated guess:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. in many cases, ""really?"" is used as a genuine expression of surprise, interest, or a request for confirmation.
2. without additional context or cues (like tone of voice, body language, or preceding dialogue), it's safer to assume a non-sarcastic interpretation.
3. in scripts or dialogue, sarcasm is often indicated more clearly through additional context or stage directions, which are absent here.

however, i want to emphasize that this label is an assumption based on limited information. the true intent could easily be sarcastic if we had more context about the conversation or the character's typical speaking style.",0.0
"CHANDLER: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. - And she said - ""No no, its too cold, nobody will go out there.""  - I said ""Maybe if we put some lights out there they will"".","ROSS: After the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given input and the identified rhetorical device of irony, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text clearly demonstrates chandler's sarcastic tone as he points out the irony in monica's earlier rejection of his suggestion to put lights on their balcony, contrasted with the current situation where someone is apparently using a balcony (likely with lights). this ironic observation, delivered in chandler's characteristic style, is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the available cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a simple line of dialogue from a character named chandler.
2. chandler is calling out for someone named janice, repeating her name twice with question marks.
3. this repetition suggests urgency or concern, which is typically not associated with sarcasm.
4. there's no context or tone indicators that would suggest this is meant to be sarcastic.
5. the straightforward nature of calling someone's name is usually done sincerely, especially when repeated.

without any contradictory context or clear indicators of irony or sarcasm, this appears to be a genuine attempt by chandler to get janice's attention or locate her, and thus is not sarcastic.",0.0

 JOEY: That book got me through some tough times
 PERSON: There is a little child inside this man.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input text and the punctuation information provided, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

this statement appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the exclamation point at the end adds emphasis that seems out of place for what would otherwise be a serious medical statement, suggesting exaggeration or mockery.

2. the content of the statement is absurd - doctors wouldn't typically say removing something would kill a patient unless it was a vital organ. this extreme scenario is likely being used for comedic effect.

3. this line is attributed to chandler, a character from the tv show ""friends"" who is known for his sarcastic humor and witty remarks.

4. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""yes,"" followed by an outrageous claim, is a common format for delivering sarcastic responses.

given these factors, especially considering chandler's character and the absurdity of the statement, this line is most likely intended to be sarcastic.",1.0
CHANDLER: And I just won a million dollars!,"ROSS: I don't want to be single. I just, I just want to be married again.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is hyperbolic, which is a common feature of sarcasm.
2. the exclamation mark adds emphasis that could be interpreted as over-the-top enthusiasm, often used in sarcastic statements.
3. the character chandler (likely from the tv show ""friends"") is known for his sarcastic humor.
4. winning a million dollars is an unlikely event, making it a prime subject for a sarcastic comment.
5. without additional context, this sudden announcement of winning such a large sum seems more likely to be a sarcastic remark than a genuine statement.

while it's possible this could be a genuine statement of excitement, given chandler's character and the nature of the statement, it's more likely to be a sarcastic comment about something else entirely.",1.0
CHANDLER: You sure he is going to be able to crack that code?,"CHANDLER: Well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I have got pants that need to be altered.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

the question asked by chandler appears to be a straightforward inquiry about someone's ability to crack a code. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the tone, phrasing, or context provided. the question seems to express genuine uncertainty or concern about the person's capability to solve the code, rather than any ironic or mocking intent that would typically characterize sarcasm.",0.0
"CHANDLER: These people find out that a spelling game is going over there, there will be nobody left at our party.","MONICA: Could guys please try to keep It down? We are trying to start a tournament.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the context and tone of chandler's statement strongly suggest sarcasm. here's why:

1. exaggeration: chandler implies that ""everybody"" would leave their party for a spelling game, which is an obvious exaggeration.

2. contrast of events: a spelling game is typically not considered more exciting than a party, making the idea that everyone would leave for it absurd.

3. chandler's character: if this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" he's known for his sarcastic humor.

4. implied criticism: the statement indirectly criticizes their party as being so boring that even a spelling game would be more appealing.

the sarcasm here serves to humorously highlight the perceived dullness of their party rather than express a genuine concern about a spelling game's appeal. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this statement.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Oh, wait a minute, I have no one.","ROSS: Hi.

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

the input text doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward realization by the character chandler that he doesn't have someone for a particular situation. the use of ""oh, wait a minute"" suggests a sudden awareness, and the statement ""i have no one"" is a direct expression of his current state. without additional context or tonal cues that might suggest otherwise, this statement should be interpreted as sincere rather than sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward statement from chandler about his smoking habits. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in the language used. the repetition of ""smoking"" and the use of time markers (""yesterday"" and ""today"") suggest that chandler is simply reporting his recent behavior in a matter-of-fact manner. the informal speech pattern and simple sentence structure are consistent with casual conversation rather than sarcastic commentary. therefore, this statement is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

"CHANDLER: I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.","RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. chandler is referencing the famous 1971 anti-littering psa featuring ""the crying indian,"" which is a well-known cultural touchstone.

2. he's humorously suggesting that littering might summon this character from the commercial to ""save"" them, which is an absurd and impossible scenario.

3. the statement subverts the original message of the psa (which was to discourage littering) by suggesting littering as a solution to their problem.

4. this type of ironic humor is very characteristic of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic quips.

the sarcasm here lies in the deliberate misuse of the anti-littering message for a completely opposite and ridiculous purpose, which is a classic form of sarcastic humor.",1.0

3. the language style is casual and conversational, but not sarcastic.
4. chandler is making a simple evaluation of a patch, stating it's not suitable without any apparent sarcastic undertones.

 PERSON2: And he was my best student.
 PERSON1: Yes she was my best teacher.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and context provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the line ""if that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?"" is clearly meant to be a sarcastic comment. it uses rhetorical questioning and implies a humorous, ironic tone that is characteristic of sarcasm. this type of witty, sardonic remark is also typical of the character chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor. the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to humorously comment on something that is likely ineffective or undesirable as a method to keep kids in school.",1.0

2. there's no obvious irony or contradiction in the statement that would indicate sarcasm.
3. the tone seems casual and informative, rather than mocking or exaggerated.

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and context provided, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this classification include:

1. the question itself is framed in a way that suggests sarcasm, as it's unlikely that the speaker seriously believes the person was late due to burying someone.

2. the mention of ""burying this woman"" as a casual reason for being late is an exaggeration that's typical of sarcastic humor.

3. the character name ""chandler"" is likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic and witty comments.

4. the informal, conversational tone combined with the dark humor aligns well with typical sarcastic dialogue in sitcoms.

5. the implication and indirect accusation in the question (""were you so late because..."") is a common structure for sarcastic remarks.

given these factors, it's highly probable that this line is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine inquiry.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is very brief and lacks context, making it difficult to detect any sarcastic tone.
2. it appears to be a simple, straightforward question about makeup.
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.
4. without more context or information about tone of voice or facial expressions, it's safer to assume the question is meant literally.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and with such a short snippet, we can't be entirely certain of the intent behind the question.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this statement from chandler is clearly sarcastic. the phrase ""stop catching on fire"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's a humorous and exaggerated way of telling someone to stop doing something problematic or dangerous. the setup of ""there is never a good time to have to..."" followed by such an absurd instruction is a classic sarcastic structure. chandler's character in the tv show ""friends"" is well-known for his sarcastic humor, which further supports this interpretation.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. it plays on the absurd mismatch between joey's medical condition (a hernia) and the completely unrelated and inappropriate treatment suggestion (laser eye surgery). this kind of deliberate mismatching of medical issues and treatments is a common form of sarcastic humor, especially in sitcom dialogue. the statement is meant to be humorous by suggesting an obviously incorrect and nonsensical solution to joey's problem.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the response appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. contrast: chandler is contrasting crying over something (presumably more serious) with crying over bambi, implying that the latter is less worthy of an emotional response.

2. dismissive tone: by emphasizing that bambi is ""a cartoon,"" chandler is downplaying its emotional impact, which goes against the common understanding that many people find bambi emotionally moving.

3. character context: if this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" he's known for his sarcastic comments and dry humor.

4. implied criticism: the statement implies criticism of those who get emotional over animated films, suggesting they're overreacting to something that's ""just a cartoon.""

5. conversational setup: the phrase ""see now"" suggests he's making a point in contrast to something said earlier, likely in a sarcastic or ironic manner.

given these factors, the statement is most likely meant to be taken sarcastically rather than at face value.",1.0

 JOEY: I am not finished.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and my understanding of the character chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" i believe the correct label for this input is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the cues mention that chandler often uses sarcasm in his speech.
2. the exclamation point and over-the-top praise (""quite the craftsman!"") can be indicators of sarcasm, especially coming from chandler.
3. without full context, chandler's compliments are often delivered sarcastically in the show, particularly when directed at joey's attempts at various crafts or skills.
4. the misspelling of ""job"" as ""jon"" could be intentional to further emphasize the sarcastic tone, mocking joey's work.

however, it's important to note that without full context, there's a small possibility this could be genuine praise. but given chandler's character and typical speech patterns, sarcasm is the more likely interpretation.",1.0

based on the provided cue and the context of the input text, chandler's statement ""well thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of sarcasm here is evident, as chandler is likely implying the opposite of what he's literally saying. this kind of statement is typically used to criticize or mock in a humorous way, which is a hallmark of sarcastic speech. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0

 JOEY: Interesting
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the response from chandler is clearly sarcastic. he uses verbal irony by first mentioning leaving tools in a bulldozer (which he obviously doesn't own) and then immediately contradicting that statement by saying he doesn't have tools. this sarcastic response is typical of chandler's character and humor style, employing both sarcasm and hyperbole to create a comedic effect.",1.0

 CHANDLER: how?
 JOEY: Maybe we can lure them out, you know of any bird calls?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of hyperbole (""tons"" and ""quite the woodsman"") suggests exaggeration for comedic effect.
2. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends.""
3. the short, clipped sentence structure and informal tone are typical of chandler's sarcastic quips.
4. the context implies that chandler is likely overstating his woodsman skills, which is a common form of self-deprecating sarcasm he often employs.
5. the juxtaposition of chandler's typically urban character with claims of extensive outdoor skills adds to the sarcastic tone.

therefore, this line is most likely intended to be sarcastic, with chandler humorously exaggerating his non-existent woodsman skills.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this line from chandler is a clear example of sarcasm. he's using irony to humorously criticize someone's lack of verbal filter or self-control. the phrase ""if only there was something in your head to control the things you say"" is not meant to be taken literally. chandler knows that everyone has a brain to control their speech; he's sarcastically implying that the person he's talking about doesn't seem to use theirs effectively. this kind of witty, biting humor is characteristic of sarcasm, especially in the context of the show friends, where chandler is known for his sarcastic remarks.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Well yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.","ROSS: So uh, does it do anything uh special?

this line is clearly sarcastic. chandler is responding to ross with an absurd and fantastical claim that obviously isn't true, using dry humor and references to fictional elements (like narnia) to mock whatever ross might have said or asked previously about chandler's third nipple. the sarcasm is evident in the exaggerated and impossible scenario chandler describes, typical of his character's witty and sarcastic humor in the show friends.",1.0

"CHANDLER: No, rabies.","CHANDLER: What what?

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given input and the available cues, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

explanation:
while the statement ""no, rabies."" is brief and somewhat unusual without context, there's not enough evidence to conclude it's sarcastic. it appears to be a straightforward, albeit abrupt, response in a dialogue. chandler is likely responding to a previous statement or question about a condition or situation, and he's suggesting rabies as an alternative explanation. without more context, we can't determine if this is meant to be humorous or sarcastic. the brevity and directness of the response suggest it's more likely a literal statement within the context of the conversation.",0.0

 ROSS: I went to their tanning place your wife suggested.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this label is appropriate because:

1. the question ""was that place the sun?"" is clearly hyperbolic and not meant to be taken literally. chandler is using exaggeration for comedic effect.

2. the use of hyperbole is a common feature in sarcastic statements, especially in sitcom dialogue (which this appears to be, given the character name ""chandler"" and the style of speech).

3. the question implies that the place chandler is referring to was extremely bright or hot, to the point of being comparable to the sun. this extreme comparison is typical of sarcastic humor.

4. the informal, conversational tone and brevity of the statement are consistent with the quick, witty remarks often associated with sarcastic dialogue in comedies.

5. without additional context, this statement appears to be a standalone quip, which is characteristic of sarcastic comments in sitcom scenarios.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" best describes the nature of this dialogue line.",1.0

this line appears to be a straightforward statement from chandler, suggesting a possible reason for someone's behavior. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or contrasting elements that would typically characterize sarcasm. the use of ""maybe"" suggests genuine speculation rather than a sarcastic remark. without additional context that might imply a contradictory meaning, this statement should be classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone appears to be sincere and reassuring, expressing affection for chandler.
2. there's no obvious irony or contradiction that would indicate sarcasm.
3. the repetition of chandler's name seems to be for emphasis rather than mockery.
4. the context suggests this is likely a genuine moment of support or reassurance in a conversation or scene.

while the statement is a bit unusual (saying someone is not themselves but still loved), it doesn't come across as sarcastic. instead, it seems to be addressing a concern or situation where chandler might feel he's not being himself, but is being reassured of continued affection despite this.",0.0
JOEY: We got a box.,"JOEY: When that guy was robbing us and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, do you know what I was doing there in all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down. Yeah. But if I had known what kind of friend you would turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much. See you around!
 CHANDLER: Wait! Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do, something. If we still had that entertainment unit, I would get in there for six hours and think about  how I let you down.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

the statement ""joey: we got a box."" is a straightforward, literal sentence without any indicators of sarcasm. the context and language style information provided support this interpretation:

1. the sentence is brief and concise, stating a simple fact.
2. it uses informal, colloquial language typical of everyday speech.
3. there are no rhetorical devices or figurative language that might suggest a sarcastic tone.
4. the statement doesn't contain any obvious exaggeration, irony, or contradiction that are often present in sarcastic remarks.

given these factors, it's most likely that joey is simply informing someone about receiving a box in a literal, non-sarcastic manner. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement should be classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

this line appears to be a straightforward statement from chandler, likely in response to some confusion or misunderstanding in a conversation. without any additional context that might suggest otherwise, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. chandler is simply clarifying that he was speaking literally, using ""the actual words"" rather than paraphrasing or implying something else. this kind of clarification is typically made in earnest to avoid misunderstandings, so it's most likely not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this line is descriptive and humorous, but it's not inherently sarcastic. it's an exaggerated description of someone's unusual walking or movement, likely intended for comedic effect in a script or dialogue. the simile used (""as if independent from his body"") is meant to create a vivid, amusing image rather than convey sarcasm or irony. this kind of exaggerated description is common in comedic writing without necessarily being sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward response in a conversation about time. chandler is making a literal point about the nature of time and the impossibility of time travel, specifically going backwards in time. the tone is matter-of-fact and explanatory, without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the language is direct and the content aligns with common knowledge about the properties of time, suggesting that this is a sincere statement rather than a sarcastic one.",0.0

 MONICA: I don't think I have enough quarters
 PHOEBE: I have quarters!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the context: chandler from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic comments.
2. the exaggerated enthusiasm: doing laundry is typically considered a mundane task, not something to be excited about doing ""all night.""
3. the exclamation marks: the use of exclamation marks emphasizes the feigned excitement, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.
4. the repetition: repeating ""all night laundry"" with an exclamation mark further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

these elements combined strongly suggest that chandler is not genuinely excited about doing laundry all night, but rather expressing sarcasm about the situation.",1.0

sarcastic

this response from chandler is clearly sarcastic. he's making a dark, humorous comment about finding people who want to die in a plane crash as their new year's resolution, which is obviously not meant to be taken literally. the exaggeration and absurdity of the statement, combined with chandler's known tendency for sarcasm and dry humor in the show ""friends,"" strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic remark.",1.0

sarcastic

the dialogue demonstrates clear sarcasm through chandler's mocking tone and use of exaggeration. he's making a joke about someone's unusual name (hornswoggle) by comparing it to fictional characters from a children's show (fraggle rock). this type of humorous, exaggerated comparison is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially when delivered with chandler's characteristic wit as implied by the context.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and the context provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. chandler's hyperbolic claim of killing joey over gum, followed by a rhetorical question about whether it was wrong, is a classic example of his character's dry, sarcastic humor. the absurdity of the statement combined with the deadpan delivery is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially in the context of the sitcom ""friends"" and chandler's character.",1.0

the input text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. exaggeration: chandler uses an absurdly specific and unlikely scenario (telescope and box of donuts) to contrast with his claim of an accident.

2. tone: the statement is delivered in a way that's meant to be humorous and not taken literally.

3. irony: while claiming it was an accident, chandler provides a detailed alternative that implies premeditation, contradicting his initial statement.

4. context: the cues suggest this is from a sitcom, where sarcasm is a common form of humor.

5. defensive humor: chandler appears to be using sarcasm as a defense mechanism, deflecting from the actual incident by proposing an absurd alternative.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the statement is sarcastic, using humor to downplay or deflect from whatever incident is being discussed.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward, albeit simplified, explanation of historical events related to the jamestown colony.
2. while the tone is casual and informal, there's no clear indication of sarcasm or irony in the statement.
3. the inaccuracy regarding king george (as the jamestown colony predates any king george's reign) seems more likely to be a character's misunderstanding or simplification rather than intentional sarcasm.
4. the conversational style and trailing off with ""so"" suggests an informal explanation rather than a sarcastic remark.

without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement appears to be a non-sarcastic attempt at explaining a historical event in casual terms.",0.0

1. the text is attributed to chandler, a character known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor (likely from the tv show ""friends"").
2. the use of a rhetorical question ""me?"" followed by an exaggerated statement ""i am gonna die alone!"" is typical of sarcastic delivery.
3. the hyperbole ""i am gonna die alone!"" is an over-dramatization that's often used in sarcastic expressions.
4. the exclamation point adds emphasis that could be interpreted as mock dramatic flair, common in sarcastic statements.
5. the informal language and dramatic tone are consistent with chandler's character and his tendency to use sarcasm as a defense mechanism or for comedic effect.

"CHANDLER: Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved and not they're all recommending Trident?","ROSS: Who?
 CHANDLER: Dee, the sarcastic sister from What's Happening!!
 RACHEL: Guys, guess what guess what guess what.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

explanation: this line from chandler (likely from the tv show ""friends"") is clearly sarcastic. it's playing on the common advertising claim that ""4 out of 5 dentists recommend"" a certain product, in this case, trident gum. the humor and sarcasm come from chandler's deadpan delivery of the idea that the one holdout dentist has finally ""caved"" and now all dentists unanimously recommend the gum. this exaggeration and mockery of advertising claims is a classic example of sarcasm.",1.0
CHANDLER: Ah your own brand of vigilante justice.,"JOEY: Did you call the cops?
 RACHEL: No, we took her to lunch
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the nature of the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""ah"" at the beginning of the sentence often indicates a sarcastic or ironic tone.
2. the phrase ""your own brand of vigilante justice"" seems to be a wry or mocking comment on someone else's actions.
3. the character chandler, particularly from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks.
4. the cues mention that the tone seems ""somewhat sarcastic or amused,"" which aligns with this interpretation.

while context is limited, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that this line is intended to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward statement.",1.0
CHANDLER: Did you tell her about the magical night that starts with the flush of every toilet?,"CHANDLER: So Ross, how was the date the other night?
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. chandler's statement about a ""magical night that starts with the flush of every toilet"" is an exaggerated and humorous way of describing what is likely a mundane or unpleasant event (possibly related to plumbing maintenance). the use of the word ""magical"" in this context is ironic, as flushing toilets is generally not considered a magical or exciting occurrence. this type of exaggerated, ironic statement is a hallmark of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0
"CHANDLER: Oh I see, I thought you just really really liked your new couch.","ROSS: Look I drew a sketch of how we are gonna do it ok? Rach, that's you, that's the couch

 ROSS: Oh, that's me.
 RACHEL: Wow! Certainly think a lot of yourself.
 ROSS: No, that's my arm.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input and the cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement from chandler is a classic example of sarcasm. the character is not literally suggesting that someone really likes their couch. instead, he's using irony to comment on someone's behavior (likely someone spending a lot of time on the couch). the phrase ""oh i see"" followed by an exaggerated or unlikely explanation is a common sarcastic structure. this fits well with chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic humor.",1.0
"MONICA: No its not big, not at all. Kind of the same lines as, I don't know, having a third nipple!","MONICA: You are dead meat
 CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the rhetorical device present in the text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of understatement in monica's statement, comparing something to ""having a third nipple,"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. she's deliberately downplaying the significance of whatever she's referring to in an exaggerated manner, which is a classic sarcastic technique. the contrast between saying it's ""not big, not at all"" and then comparing it to something unusual like a third nipple creates a humorous and sarcastic tone.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the context suggests this is a humorous, sarcastic comment from the character chandler, likely from the tv show ""friends."" the phrasing and subject matter are consistent with chandler's typical sarcastic humor style on the show.",1.0
CHANDLER: And I think my testicles may be in here too,"RACHEL: Do you guys have any exta ribbon?
 CHANDLER: Oh yeah sure, what do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, rafia, gingam , felt.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this line is clearly intended to be humorous and sarcastic. it's a typical example of chandler's character (likely from the tv show ""friends"") using exaggeration and self-deprecating humor. the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a joking way to emphasize how cold or uncomfortable a situation is. the hyperbole of suggesting his testicles might be in some location due to extreme cold is a classic sarcastic quip, fitting chandler's character and the show's style of humor.",1.0
"JOEY: ThatÕs good, just keep rubbing your head. That will turn back time","PHOEBE: Oh so pretty, this must have cost him a fortune.
 CHANDLER: Oh c'mon Ross, remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought the ridiculosly expensive crustal duck?
 RACHEL: What did you just say?
 CHANDLER: Crustal duck.
 RACHEL: No, no, no, the love part? Oh my god!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the information provided and my analysis of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

this line appears to be sarcastic because:

1. it's clearly not possible to turn back time by rubbing one's head.
2. the statement is absurd and seems to be mocking or making light of someone's actions or desires.
3. the character joey is likely using humor to comment on a situation, possibly someone's regret or wish to undo something.

the exaggerated claim and impossibility of the action suggest this is meant to be humorous and not taken literally, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.",1.0

 CHANDLER: That I did. That I did.
 PERSON: So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited context provided, i don't see clear indicators of sarcasm in this short line of dialogue. chandler appears to be asking for clarification about his duties and then agreeing or preparing to hear about them. without more context, it's safest to interpret this as a straightforward question and acknowledgment.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is a simple, enthusiastic affirmation.
2. there's no context or additional information suggesting any irony or hidden meaning.
3. the use of an exclamation mark indicates genuine enthusiasm rather than sarcasm.
4. the brevity and straightforwardness of the response don't leave room for sarcastic undertones.
5. none of the provided cues suggest any sarcastic elements in this simple dialogue snippet.

therefore, this appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic response from joey.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given cues and the input text, i believe i can provide a reliable judgment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the exclamation ""no way!"" is a common expression of surprise, disbelief, or strong disagreement. in this context, without any additional information that might suggest irony or sarcasm, it appears to be a genuine expression of chandler's shock or disbelief about something. the use of an exclamation mark emphasizes the intensity of the reaction. while chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the show ""friends,"" this particular line on its own doesn't inherently indicate sarcasm. it's more likely a straightforward reaction to something unexpected or unbelievable that has just been said or has occurred.",0.0
RACHEL: Oh.,"RACHEL: Hi! What are you doing here?
 ROSS: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input text ""rachel: oh."" and the current cues, i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the single-word response ""oh"" can have various meanings depending on the context, tone, and situation, which are not provided here.

therefore, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

i choose this label because:

1. there's no clear indicator of sarcasm in this brief response.
2. ""oh"" is often used as a neutral acknowledgment or expression of surprise.
3. without additional context or cues (such as tone of voice, facial expression, or preceding conversation), it's safer to assume a non-sarcastic interpretation.

however, i want to emphasize that this classification is made with low confidence due to the lack of context. in a different scenario with more information, this same ""oh"" could potentially be sarcastic.",0.0

 CHANDLER: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
 JOEY: Which part exactly?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided input and cues, i would assign the following label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the dialogue appears to be a straightforward, urgent request from chandler to leave.
2. the exclamatory tone and question format suggest genuine impatience or eagerness rather than sarcasm.
3. there's no obvious irony or contradiction in the statement that would indicate sarcasm.
4. the brevity and directness of the dialogue align more with sincere communication rather than sarcastic undertones.

while context can sometimes change the interpretation of dialogue, based solely on this line and the provided cues, it appears to be a non-sarcastic statement expressing a genuine desire to leave or conclude something.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available cues and the input text, i don't have enough context to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the exclamation ""great!"" could be genuine enthusiasm or sarcasm, depending on the broader context and tone of the conversation. without more information about the situation or the character's typical manner of speaking, it's not possible to accurately label this as sarcastic or not sarcastic.",0.0
"PHOEBE: Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?","PHOEBE: Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this dialogue is:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
while the tone could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic or exasperated, there isn't enough context to definitively classify this as sarcasm. the question appears to be a straightforward inquiry about the appearance of an object, possibly in a casual conversation. without more context or clear indicators of sarcastic intent, it's safer to classify this as not sarcastic. the informal language and direct question style are more indicative of a genuine inquiry or rhetorical question expressing confusion or frustration, rather than clear sarcasm.",0.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text ""ross: yeah it would!"" appears to be a straightforward, enthusiastic agreement. the exclamation mark indicates excitement or emphasis, but there's no evidence of irony or sarcasm. the informal and conversational tone, as noted in the language style analysis, suggests a genuine response rather than a sarcastic one. without additional context that might contradict the surface meaning, it's most reasonable to interpret this statement as sincere and not sarcastic.",0.0

 ROSS: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

rationale:
1. the exclamation ""really!?"" is a common expression of genuine surprise, disbelief, or excitement.
2. without additional context indicating irony or contradiction, this brief reaction appears to be a straightforward expression of emotion.
3. the use of both an exclamation mark and a question mark emphasizes the intensity of the reaction, which is more typical of sincere responses rather than sarcastic ones.
4. sarcasm often requires more context or a clear contradiction between what is said and what is meant, which is not evident in this brief statement.

therefore, based on the limited information available, this exclamation from rachel is most likely not sarcastic, but rather a genuine expression of surprise or disbelief.",0.0

2. while it could potentially be used sarcastically in some contexts, there's not enough information here to suggest that it's being used ironically or to mock someone.
3. the use of hyperbole (as noted in the rhetorical devices cue) doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm; it can be used for emphasis in sincere statements as well.
4. the formal tone and concise nature of the statement align more with a serious declaration than a sarcastic comment.

without additional context that might suggest a sarcastic intent, it's more likely that this statement is meant to be taken at face value, expressing the idea that the king is truly inaccessible or isolated from the public.",0.0

sarcastic

the context strongly suggests this is a sarcastic or humorous statement. the character chandler (likely from the tv show friends, known for his sarcastic humor) is admitting to making up a game, which implies he had previously tried to pass it off as real. this kind of playful deception and subsequent admission is a common form of situational sarcasm or humor in sitcoms.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

the input text displays clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the speaker is making a playful, unrealistic request by asking for ""a date"" alongside their food order.
2. the phrase ""if you're given' 'em out"" is a humorous implication that dates could be casually distributed like menu items.
3. this kind of quip is a common form of flirtatious sarcasm, where someone jokingly treats something valuable or personal (like a date) as if it were a trivial item.

the tone and context strongly suggest this is a sarcastic, lighthearted comment rather than a sincere request, hence the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1.0

5. without additional context, tone indicators, or contradictory information, it's more likely that this is a sincere, non-sarcastic response.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided context and language style analysis, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the statement exhibits classic elements of sarcasm, including:

1. the use of understatement (""little breakfast adventure"") to describe what was likely a more significant incident.
2. the contrast between ""fine"" and the implied damage caused by the ""adventure.""
3. the specific mention of ""angela delvecchio,"" which adds a pointed accusation to the statement.
4. the overall tone, which is indirectly accusing while maintaining a facade of casual observation.

this fits well with the character of chandler, who is known for his sarcastic humor in the show ""friends."" the statement is clearly not meant to be taken at face value, but rather as a humorous and indirect way of pointing out someone's responsibility for damaging the furniture.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics that suggest sarcasm:

1. the stuttering or repetition in ""what-wh-what"" indicates surprise or disbelief, which is often used in sarcastic expressions.

2. the question ""so we'll just stay married forever?"" seems to be a rhetorical question, implying that the speaker (rachel) finds the idea absurd or unrealistic.

3. the use of ""just"" in this context often carries a sarcastic tone, minimizing the significance of a major decision like staying married forever.

4. the punctuation, particularly the question mark at the end, reinforces the incredulous tone of the statement.

5. the context of discussing staying married ""forever"" in such a casual manner suggests that rachel is not seriously considering this as a viable option, but rather pointing out its absurdity.

these elements combined strongly indicate that rachel is using sarcasm to express her disbelief or disagreement with the idea of staying married forever.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit vague, suggestion.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or mockery in the brief text.
3. the informal language and uncertain tone (""i don't know"") suggest a genuine, if somewhat stereotypical, response.
4. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it seems to be a sincere, if not particularly helpful, attempt at answering a question or making a suggestion.

while the use of ""girlie"" could be considered stereotyping, it doesn't inherently make the statement sarcastic. the speaker appears to be genuinely unsure and offering a broad, if potentially problematic, suggestion.",0.0

 PERSON: What is going on?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuine expression of confusion or alarm from ross, followed by a direct response. the repetitive and exclamatory nature of the dialogue suggests genuine emotion rather than sarcasm. the context cues indicate that this is likely part of a larger conversation or scene where something unexpected has occurred, prompting ross's reaction. the informal, emotional tone and punctuation (multiple exclamation marks) further support that this is a sincere outburst rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

 JOEY: A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this label is appropriate because:

1. the statement is a clear example of verbal irony, where chandler says something that contradicts what is generally considered responsible financial behavior.

2. the use of a rhetorical question (""who needs a savings account"") is a common sarcastic device, implying the opposite of what is literally stated.

3. the context suggests that chandler, at 29, is old enough to understand the importance of savings, making his dismissive attitude likely to be sarcastic rather than sincere.

4. the casual tone (""well, y'know"") combined with the seemingly irresponsible financial attitude is typical of sarcastic humor, especially in sitcom dialogue.

5. this type of self-deprecating humor about financial irresponsibility is characteristic of chandler's character (assuming this is from the tv show ""friends""), who often uses sarcasm.

the sarcasm here lies in the fact that chandler is implying he's too young to need savings, when in reality, 29 is an age where most people should be actively saving. this contradiction between the stated attitude and the expected responsible behavior is the essence of the sarcastic tone in this statement.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" based on the following considerations:

1. character context: chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends.""

2. question format: the use of a question, especially with an unexpected or exaggerated scenario (protecting from a tornado), is often a hallmark of sarcastic remarks.

3. implied tone: the statement seems to carry an implied tone of disbelief or mockery, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

4. lack of context: the use of ""them"" without a clear antecedent suggests this is part of a larger conversation, likely set up for a sarcastic punchline.

5. exaggeration: mentioning tornado protection in what seems to be an unrelated or unexpected context is a common sarcastic technique to highlight absurdity.

given chandler's character traits and the structure of the statement, it's highly likely that this line is meant to be interpreted as sarcastic rather than a genuine inquiry about tornado protection.",1.0

this is a straightforward question without any indicators of sarcasm. the language analysis shows it's a direct, casual inquiry typical of everyday communication between people who know each other. there are no rhetorical devices or contextual clues that would suggest sarcastic intent. it's simply a person asking about someone else's arrival time home, which is a common and sincere question in many situations.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by chandler is clearly sarcastic. he's pointing out, with a dry and humorous tone, that chasing after a food vendor (the ""churo guy"") is not actually a form of exercise like jogging. this fits the definition of sarcasm, where the speaker says something that's opposite to or different from what they really mean, often for humorous effect. the contrast between actual jogging and frantically chasing after a food cart highlights the absurdity of considering the latter as exercise, which is the core of the sarcastic comment.",1.0
"PERSON: Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know how that happened.","PERSON: I remember when we first got engaged.
 CHANDLER: Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm, particularly in the last sentence ""i still don't know how that happened."" this statement employs verbal irony, as noted in the rhetorical device analysis. the speaker is feigning ignorance about the cause of pregnancy, which is generally well-understood, especially by someone old enough to be in that situation.

the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""well,"" at the beginning also set up a context where sarcasm is more likely to occur. the contrast between the matter-of-fact statement about getting someone pregnant and the feigned confusion about how it happened creates a humorous effect typical of sarcastic comments.

therefore, based on these cues and the content of the statement, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0

reasoning:
1. the question appears to be a straightforward inquiry about whether something was pain-free as expected.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the formal structure and word choice (""was it not"" instead of ""wasn't it"") imply sincerity rather than sarcasm.
4. without additional context suggesting otherwise, it's most likely that phoebe is genuinely asking for information or confirmation about a previous event or procedure that was supposed to be pain-free.

not sarcastic

this line appears to be a humorous moment from a sitcom or similar media, where the character joey is recounting a mispronunciation. the humor comes from the genuine mistake or misunderstanding, rather than from sarcasm. the cues indicate this is likely a scripted moment meant to be funny due to the character's confusion or verbal error, but it doesn't contain the hallmarks of sarcastic intent or tone.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the utterance ""uh-huh!"" is a simple, affirmative response typically used to indicate agreement or acknowledgment.
2. while the exclamation mark suggests enthusiasm or emphasis, it doesn't inherently imply sarcasm.
3. the brevity of the response and lack of context make it difficult to infer any sarcastic intent.
4. ""uh-huh"" is a common, informal spoken language interjection that is often used sincerely.
5. without additional context that might suggest irony or contradiction, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a straightforward, non-sarcastic response.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this line of dialogue does not appear to be sarcastic. chandler is simply clarifying that he was speaking hypothetically about something, likely in response to a misunderstanding. the repetition of ""no"" and the use of ""just"" and ""hypothetically"" indicate he's earnestly trying to explain himself and correct a misconception. there's no evidence of irony, mockery, or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems straightforward and sincere, aimed at clearing up confusion rather than making a sarcastic remark.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text is a simple, straightforward statement of opinion followed by an action.
2. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory context.
3. the language style is described as informal and conversational, which is consistent with a genuine, non-sarcastic statement.
4. the use of ""well"" as a conversational filler and the simple sentence structure suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited context provided in the input text ""whoa, whoa, whoa,"" and considering the cues given, i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the exclamation ""whoa, whoa, whoa"" is commonly used to express surprise, to interrupt someone, or to call for a pause in a conversation. without additional context about the situation, tone of voice, or surrounding conversation, it's impossible to judge whether sarcasm is intended.

therefore, i cannot assign a definitive label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input. the statement itself is neutral and could be used in either sarcastic or non-sarcastic contexts depending on the broader situation and delivery.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

the input ""phoebe: okay?"" is a simple, brief line of dialogue that doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward question or confirmation, likely seeking agreement or understanding from another person in the conversation. the question mark suggests uncertainty or a request for confirmation, which is common in normal, non-sarcastic speech. without additional context or tone indicators, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic.",0.0

 ROSS: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

this label is based on several factors:

1. the use of the term ""interfacing"" in a human context is unusual and likely deliberately so. it's typically used for technological systems, not human interactions.

2. the formal, technical language (""interfacing"") contrasts with the informal, casual structure of the sentence, creating a humorous incongruity.

3. without more context, it appears ross is making a joke about human interaction by describing it in overly technical terms, which is a common form of sarcasm.

4. the statement seems to be purposefully awkward or exaggerated, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

5. in everyday conversation, people don't typically describe their interactions as ""interfacing,"" so this unusual word choice suggests ross is not being entirely serious.

while it's possible this could be a non-sarcastic statement in a very specific context (e.g., if ross is actually discussing a technological interface), the more likely interpretation based on common usage and conversational norms is that this is a sarcastic comment about human interaction.",1.0

explanation: while the statement does convey some complexity in phoebe's feelings and actions, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the exclamation and urgency in her tone suggest genuine emotion rather than irony or sarcasm. phoebe seems to be expressing a sincere desire to appear nonchalant in a potentially awkward situation, which is a common social strategy. the language is direct and straightforward, without the typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrary statements. therefore, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given information and the identified rhetorical device of understatement, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the use of understatement in chandler's dialogue is a classic indicator of sarcasm, particularly in the context of the character's typical communication style in the show ""friends."" chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, and this line exemplifies his tendency to use understatement to convey the opposite of what he actually means or feels. by saying they're ""just goofin' around"" and ""nothing,"" he's likely downplaying a more significant relationship or situation, which is a common sarcastic technique.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the exclamation ""paper cut!"" by chandler appears to be a genuine reaction to experiencing a paper cut. paper cuts are known to be surprisingly painful despite their minor nature, and it's common for people to exclaim when they get one. the brevity and directness of the statement, along with the exclamation mark, suggest a spontaneous and sincere reaction rather than a sarcastic comment. without any additional context indicating irony or a setup for a joke, it's most likely a straightforward expression of pain or surprise at getting a paper cut.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a genuine question from a character named ross, expressing vulnerability and seeking reassurance about love.
2. there are no obvious markers of sarcasm or irony in the short text.
3. the question mark indicates a sincere inquiry rather than a sarcastic statement.
4. the context cues suggest this is likely a line from a script or conversation dealing with emotional relationship topics, which are often addressed sincerely rather than sarcastically.
5. the direct and simple nature of the question aligns more with a straightforward, non-sarcastic communication style.

 JOEY: Hello.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the given input and the provided cues, this statement appears to be a sincere apology from chandler, not a sarcastic remark. the context and tone suggest that chandler is genuinely acknowledging his mistake and attempting to explain or justify his actions. the language is direct and apologetic, which is inconsistent with typical sarcastic speech. additionally, the topic and rhetorical device identified in the cues (apophasis) support the interpretation that this is a serious, albeit awkward, attempt at an apology rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0
CHANDLER: Lovely,"MONICA: No.
 CHANDLER: How long have we been home?
 MONICA: About a half an hour.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether this statement is sarcastic or not. however, given that this is a line from chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"", and considering the brevity and potentially exaggerated positivity of the response, there's a possibility that this could be a sarcastic comment.

that said, without more context about the situation or the tone in which it was delivered, we can't be absolutely sure. chandler could genuinely be expressing appreciation for something.

given these considerations, i would lean towards labeling this as:

label: sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this judgment is made with limited information and could be incorrect without more context.",1.0
"PERSON: Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life","MONICA: Ooh, nice.
 PERSON: So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
 MONICA: Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and the cues provided, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a genuine, reflective comment about personal thoughts.
2. the language style is informal and hesitant, which is typical of sincere spoken communication.
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contrast between the literal and intended meaning.
4. the context suggests introspection and personal reflection, which are usually expressed sincerely rather than sarcastically.
5. the unfinished nature of the thought aligns more with honest, impromptu speech than with crafted sarcasm.

therefore, the most appropriate label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
CHANDLER: I'm the ruptured spleen.,"MONICA: Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
 CHANDLER: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
 MONICA: What?!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the line ""i'm the ruptured spleen"" spoken by chandler appears to be a sarcastic or humorous self-description. it's likely meant to be comedic, as a person wouldn't literally be a ruptured spleen. the use of this unusual metaphor suggests chandler is employing sarcasm, possibly to express feeling damaged or useless in some context, or as part of a joke or roleplay scenario. without fuller context it's hard to be certain, but the absurdist nature of the statement strongly points toward a sarcastic intent.",1.0

 PHOEBE: Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?
 PERSON: I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i cannot determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the single-word question ""why?"" asked by phoebe does not provide enough context to make a reliable judgment about sarcasm. sarcasm typically requires more context or tone to be evident. without additional information about the situation, the tone of voice, or the surrounding conversation, it's impossible to accurately label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the phrase ""oh, come on!"" is a common exclamation used to express exasperation, disbelief, or frustration.
2. without additional context, this exclamation appears to be a genuine reaction rather than a sarcastic statement.
3. the cues indicate that this is likely part of a casual conversation or script dialogue, where such expressions are often used sincerely.
4. the brevity and directness of the statement suggest a straightforward emotional response rather than the more complex, layered meaning typically associated with sarcasm.
5. while sarcasm can sometimes be conveyed through tone of voice, which we can't determine from text alone, there's nothing in this short phrase that inherently suggests a sarcastic intent.

therefore, based on the available information, the most appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 PHOEBE: I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration and disappointment from phoebe about her current situation. the language is direct and conveys genuine feelings without any apparent irony or sarcasm. phoebe is candidly expressing that being limited to pregnancy-related activities is making her feel upset or discouraged. the use of casual language like ""bums me out"" further reinforces the sincerity of her statement. there are no contextual cues or linguistic markers that suggest this statement is meant to be taken as sarcastic.",0.0

3. ""hey"" is a common, straightforward way to start a conversation.

3. the context suggests a normal social interaction where someone is seeking approval for a meetup.
4. there are no clear contradictions or unexpected twists in the statement that might suggest sarcastic intent.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward dialogue where chandler is earnestly defending his reaction to janice. the repetition of ""janice"" and the phrase ""you gotta give me janice"" suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm. the context implies that chandler is explaining his behavior, likely in response to being accused of being too picky in relationships. the informal, conversational tone and the direct nature of the statement indicate that chandler is being genuine in his explanation, not employing sarcasm.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this line appears to be a straightforward statement from phoebe indicating that she has completed a task or action. the informal language and use of ""oughta"" suggests a casual, matter-of-fact tone rather than a sarcastic one. without additional context or cues that might suggest irony or mockery, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a sincere statement. therefore, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
JOEY: Hey.,"ROSS: Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
 MONICA: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
 RACHEL: I didn't know there were docks.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the extremely brief input ""joey: hey."" and the cues provided, there is not enough context or content to determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple greeting like ""hey"" can be used sincerely or sarcastically depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation - none of which are provided here.

therefore, i cannot reliably assign a label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input. the greeting itself is neutral and could be used in either a sincere or sarcastic manner depending on factors that are not present in this limited text.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this brief line of dialogue from chandler doesn't contain any obvious markers of sarcasm. it's a straightforward agreement to have something, likely in response to an offer. the tone appears genuine and matter-of-fact. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement should be taken at face value as a sincere acceptance. therefore, the appropriate label is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 ROSS: No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this dialogue does not contain any elements of sarcasm. it appears to be a sincere, albeit nervous, attempt by ross to reveal important information about ""someone else"" to another person. the hesitation (""umm""), repetition (""there's-there's""), and the overall context suggest this is a serious and potentially difficult conversation, likely about relationships. the language is straightforward and lacks any ironic or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm.",0.0

 RACHEL: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""twenty-one hours, you're a hero"" seems to be exaggerating the significance of staying awake or being active for 21 hours by calling someone a ""hero"" for this relatively common feat.

2. the brevity and directness of the statement, along with the informal tone, suggest a dry or deadpan delivery often associated with sarcasm.

3. there's an implied contrast between the mundane act of being awake for 21 hours and the grandiose label of ""hero,"" which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. without additional context, the statement appears to be mocking or poking fun at the idea that staying up for 21 hours is a heroic act, rather than genuinely praising someone.

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, the combination of exaggeration and the mismatch between the action and the praise strongly suggests a sarcastic intent in this case.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a fragment of natural dialogue, with hesitation and interrupted speech patterns typical of genuine conversation.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory statements.
3. the speaker (rachel) seems to be earnestly describing a situation where someone ""just went on,"" which doesn't imply a sarcastic tone.

3. the context suggests a casual, conversational dialogue, likely from a script or transcript.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the analysis of the rhetorical devices and the tone of the statement, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of exaggeration, strong emotion, and informal language in this short exclamation strongly suggests that monica is using sarcasm to express her frustration. the hyperbolic phrase ""screwing us all day"" is particularly indicative of sarcastic speech, as it's likely an intentional overstatement used for dramatic effect rather than a literal description of events.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement. rachel is explaining or apologizing for an unintended action. the use of ""i did not mean to"" and the trailing off with ""i mean"" suggest sincerity and possibly embarrassment or hesitation, rather than sarcasm. the informal, apologetic tone and incomplete thought are more indicative of genuine explanation than sarcastic intent.",0.0

 PERSON: What?
 ROSS: Stupid balls are in the way.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the analysis of the language style and context provided, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the phrase ""oh well"" at the beginning suggests a resigned or dismissive tone, which is often used in sarcastic comments.

2. the use of ""probably would've been"" implies that the speaker believes their solution was superior, but it wasn't implemented. this contrast between what could have been and what actually happened is a common setup for sarcastic remarks.

3. the term ""most constructive solution"" seems slightly exaggerated in this context, especially when paired with the dismissive ""oh well."" this overstatement is characteristic of sarcasm.

4. the context information suggests that ross is responding to a rejected idea, and his comment appears to be a way of passive-aggressively highlighting the perceived mistake of not choosing his solution.

while the sarcasm here is subtle, the combination of resignation, implied superiority of the rejected idea, and the contrast between the casual ""oh well"" and the more formal ""constructive solution"" strongly suggests a sarcastic intent.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is extremely brief and lacks context, making it difficult to detect any sarcastic intent.
2. ""yeah?"" is a common, neutral response used to acknowledge someone or to prompt for more information.
3. there are no indicators of tone or additional context that would suggest sarcasm.
4. the language style information describes it as informal speech and a casual conversation style, which doesn't inherently imply sarcasm.
5. without more context or cues indicating otherwise, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a straightforward, non-sarcastic response.",0.0

this brief line ""phoebe: the end."" appears to be a straightforward statement, likely from a script or dialogue. there's no contextual information or linguistic cues that suggest sarcasm. the phrase ""the end"" is commonly used to signal the conclusion of a story, performance, or narrative, and there's no reason to interpret it sarcastically here. therefore, based on the limited information provided, the most appropriate label is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the exaggerated frustration expressed by phoebe (""it's so hard!"")
2. the hyperbolic statement that ""nothing rhymes with your stupid name!""
3. the use of ""stupid"" to describe the name, which is likely an overstatement

3. the informal, conversational style and use of colloquial expressions (""some guy"") are often associated with sarcastic speech.

4. the abrupt escalation from trying to stop a sale to being put in jail is so extreme that it's more likely to be a sarcastic comment than a genuine report of events.

5. the character phoebe, based on this line, seems to be using hyperbole and dramatic language to humorously emphasize her failed attempt to prevent a sale, which is consistent with sarcastic speech patterns.

therefore, considering all these factors, the text is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a literal statement.",1.0

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the context suggests this is likely a line from a sitcom or casual dialogue, where sarcasm is common.
2. the question ""you building a post office?"" is likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a hyperbolic or exaggerated comment on someone's actions.

4. the brevity and casual nature of the question, combined with the unlikely scenario of actually building a post office, strongly suggests this is a sarcastic remark rather than a genuine inquiry.

given these factors, it's highly probable that this line is intended to be sarcastic, likely commenting on someone dealing with an excessive amount of paperwork, mail, or a complex task that humorously reminds chandler of building a post office.",1.0

the line ""it'll cost you one husband"" is clearly a sarcastic quip, typical of chandler's character (likely from the tv show ""friends""). he's using hyperbole to humorously suggest that whatever is being discussed is so expensive or problematic that it would cost a marriage. this kind of witty, exaggerated statement is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially in the context of sitcom dialogue.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the stark contrast between monica's initial strong disagreement (""nooo! no, that's not true."") and her subsequent enthusiastic praise (""best time ever! yeah, you rocked my world!"") is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

2. the cues mention that monica is likely speaking in an ""exaggerated or sarcastic manner,"" which aligns with the tone of the input text.

3. the over-the-top nature of the praise (""you rocked my world!"") following a clear disagreement suggests that monica is not being sincere, but rather using sarcasm to emphasize her actual dissatisfaction or disagreement.

4. the abrupt shift in tone within such a short statement is characteristic of sarcastic speech, where the speaker quickly pivots from negation to exaggerated positive affirmation for effect.

given these factors, it's highly likely that monica is using sarcasm in this statement to express her true feelings, which are negative, through exaggerated positive language.",1.0

label: sarcastic

this line appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of the exaggerated term ""chan love"" is likely a self-deprecating joke from chandler about his own appeal.

2. the statement ""she couldn't live without"" is hyperbolic, which is a common feature of sarcastic speech.

3. chandler, particularly if this is from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.

4. the tone of the statement suggests chandler is not being entirely serious about someone's attachment to him.

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i believe i can confidently label this text as:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the context suggests a casual, speculative conversation with a humorous tone.
2. the statement makes an unexpected and absurd connection between mary poppins (a quintessentially british character) and having an italian cousin.
3. the use of ""maybe"" indicates a playful, non-serious suggestion.
4. the allusion to mary poppins is used in a way that subverts expectations, which is a common sarcastic technique.
5. the informal conversational style and the seemingly random speculation about a fictional character's potential relatives are consistent with sarcastic humor.

while the sarcasm is subtle, the combination of these elements strongly suggests that dorothy is making a sarcastic comment, likely in response to something rose said earlier in their conversation.",1.0

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of confusion or frustration, rather than sarcasm. dorothy is directly stating that she cannot understand the commercials for the perfume ""obsession."" there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm. the language is simple and direct, conveying genuine difficulty in comprehending the advertisements. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
"DOROTHY: No, I am depressed becaues Phillis George left the morning news.","ROSE: Are you depressed about Glen?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the hyperbole identified in the statement strongly suggests sarcastic intent. the exaggerated claim of being ""depressed"" over a news anchor leaving a morning show is likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather used as a humorous or dramatic overstatement. this kind of exaggeration is a common hallmark of sarcasm, especially when applied to relatively trivial matters like changes in tv programming.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a simple, straightforward response from dorothy to blanche about a venus fly trap.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory tone.
3. the context suggests this is likely part of a casual conversation or script dialogue, where dorothy is directly addressing or correcting blanche about something related to a venus fly trap.
4. the brevity and directness of the statement ""no blanche, with a venus fly trap"" aligns more with a literal, non-sarcastic communication.

without more context, it's difficult to detect any sarcastic intent in this short statement. the text appears to be a straightforward disagreement or correction, rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text ""dorothy: lords of arabia"" appears to be a title or heading, likely for a book, film, or other creative work.
2. titles are typically straightforward and meant to be descriptive or attention-grabbing, not sarcastic.
3. there's no context or additional information that would suggest any sarcastic intent.
4. the format and content align with a standard title structure, using a name (possibly an author or character) followed by a subtitle.
5. none of the provided cues indicate any sarcastic elements or undertones in the text.

not sarcastic

rationale:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward expression of worry by dorothy.
2. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or humor that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the language style is described as informal speech, likely dialogue, which aligns with a genuine expression of concern.
4. the context information suggests dorothy is genuinely apprehensive about a possible connection between someone and phir resuda.
5. the tone of worry and concern is not typically associated with sarcasm, which often involves mockery or irony.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of worry rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0
"DOROTHY: Oh ma no, it was a little girl selling girl scout toilets.","DOROTHY: Oh fine we will!
 SOPHIA: Is that Paolo?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

i believe this label is reliable based on the following reasoning:

1. incongruity: the phrase ""girl scout toilets"" is absurd and unexpected, as girl scouts are famously known for selling cookies, not toilets. this stark contrast between expectation and reality is a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. informal tone: the use of ""oh ma"" suggests a casual, potentially exasperated tone, which often accompanies sarcastic statements.

3. context clues: the phrase ""oh ma no"" implies that dorothy is correcting a misunderstanding, likely in an exaggerated or humorous way.

4. intentional mistake: the substitution of ""toilets"" for ""cookies"" is almost certainly deliberate, used for comedic effect or to make a point through sarcasm.

5. conversational setting: sarcasm is more common in informal, conversational contexts like this dialogue.

given these factors, especially the absurd juxtaposition of girl scouts with toilets instead of cookies, this statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine mistake or misunderstanding.",1.0
"DOROTHY: No, I haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.","PERSON: Sophia was discharged, is she here?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the given input and the current cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
while the statement itself is straightforward, the context it implies is highly unusual and likely not meant to be taken literally. the casual tone used to discuss keeping someone in a car trunk suggests this is likely a sarcastic or humorous response rather than a genuine statement about an actual situation. the incongruity between the serious implications of the content (someone being in a car trunk) and the nonchalant delivery is a common hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement uses dark humor and exaggeration (""hack herself to death"") in a casual, conversational tone, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. the speaker, dorothy, is likely not seriously suggesting that rose should watch someone harm themselves, but rather using this extreme statement to make a point or express frustration in a satirical way. this kind of dialogue is typical of sitcom-style humor, especially in shows known for their sarcastic wit.",1.0

 SOPHIA: Are you referring to me?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i believe this statement is sarcastic. here's why:

1. absurd content: the claim that cary grant (a famous hollywood actor) is living in a broom closet is highly implausible and absurd, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.

2. context and tone: the dialogue format and informal language suggest a conversational tone, where sarcasm is more likely to occur.

3. exaggeration: the extreme nature of the statement (a celebrity living in a broom closet) is a form of exaggeration often used in sarcastic remarks.

4. contradiction: the phrase ""ofcourse no ma"" followed by an absurd statement creates a contradiction that is typical of sarcastic responses.

5. humor: the statement appears to be intended as humorous, which aligns with the use of sarcasm in casual conversation.

given these factors, it's highly likely that dorothy is not being literal but is instead making a sarcastic remark, possibly in response to a previous question or statement from ""ma.""",1.0

 ROSE: Are you upset because Blanche is going to sell the house and we can't live together.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. joe piscopo, primarily known as a comedian and impressionist, would be an extremely unlikely choice for the lead role in ""rain man,"" a serious drama.

2. the film ""rain man"" starred dustin hoffman and tom cruise, both well-established dramatic actors. the idea of being genuinely upset about joe piscopo not getting the role is absurd, suggesting sarcasm.

3. the tone and context suggest this is likely a humorous or ironic comment, possibly mocking someone else's complaint or making light of casting decisions in hollywood.

4. the lack of punctuation and casual tone further support the idea that this is not a serious statement but rather a sarcastic quip.

given these factors, it's highly probable that dorothy is using sarcasm to express a humorous or ironic sentiment, rather than genuine disappointment about joe piscopo's casting.",1.0
DOROTHY: A bucket of chicked. I hope you like it extra flat and crispy,"ROSE: We brought dinner.
 SOPHIA: What you get?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation: the text appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the phrase ""extra flat and crispy"" is likely not a genuine description of desirable fried chicken. typically, fried chicken is prized for being juicy and crispy, not flat.

2. the context suggests this is a humorous or sarcastic comment about the condition of the chicken, implying it may be overcooked or somehow flattened.

3. the informal tone and colloquial expression (""a bucket of chicked"") combined with the unexpected description create a humorous effect typical of sarcasm.

4. the misspelling of ""chicken"" as ""chicked"" could be intentional, adding to the overall comedic and sarcastic tone of the statement.

therefore, dorothy's statement appears to be a sarcastic comment about the poor quality or condition of the fried chicken, rather than a sincere offer or description.",1.0
DOROTHY: It's a musical Rose,"ROSE: What kind of a movie is this Dorothy?

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""it's a musical rose"" appears to be a straightforward comment made by dorothy, likely in reference to some form of entertainment or performance. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief statement. the context cues suggest this is a simple, informative remark about something being musical, possibly addressing someone named rose or referring to something with ""rose"" in its title. without any contradictory elements or exaggerated tone that might suggest sarcasm, it's reasonable to conclude that this statement is meant to be taken at face value and is therefore not sarcastic.",0.0

sarcastic

the text uses an allusion to jimmy swaggart's scandal to make a sarcastic comment about someone's financial or moral situation. the misspelling of swaggart's name as ""swaager"" and the reference to not being able to ""cover his motel bill"" are clear indicators of sarcasm, using the televangelist's infamous scandal as a point of humorous comparison.",1.0

reasoning:

2. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
3. the informal, conversational style is consistent with normal dialogue rather than sarcastic speech.
4. the context, while limited, suggests dorothy is simply providing information about the location of an object, which doesn't typically lend itself to sarcasm.
5. the lack of additional context or cues that might suggest a sarcastic intent supports a literal interpretation of the statement.

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"label: sarcastic

this line is clearly sarcastic. dorothy's response ""in what blanche, dog years?"" indicates she's skeptically questioning something blanche has said, likely about age or time. by suggesting ""dog years"" as an alternative, dorothy is implying that blanche's statement is exaggerated or unrealistic. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the speaker says something they don't literally mean in order to convey criticism or disbelief.",1.0

the given text appears to be a straightforward, playful response from a character named dorothy. while it contains wordplay with ""sunbrella"" (likely a blend of ""sun"" and ""umbrella""), there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the statement seems to be a lighthearted explanation or punchline to a question or observation, possibly about a rose. the tone is more whimsical and clever rather than sarcastic or mocking. without additional context suggesting an intent to be ironic or contradictory, it's best to interpret this as a non-sarcastic, imaginative piece of dialogue.",0.0

3. there's no clear indicator of irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm.

5. the informal, conversational tone is consistent with genuine questions rather than sarcastic remarks.

while the meaning of ""my ben gazara in person?"" is unclear without more context, the overall structure and tone of the questions do not suggest sarcasm. instead, they appear to be sincere inquiries from a character who is trying to recall or understand something.",0.0

1. the text appears to be a straightforward line of dialogue from a character named dorothy.
2. it describes a fantastical or whimsical situation involving a ""little man"" who controls lights.
3. the language is simple and explanatory, without any obvious irony or sarcastic tone.
4. the context suggests this is likely from a children's story or fantasy narrative, where such imaginative elements are common and typically presented sincerely.

the text ""member-girl: nooo"" appears to be a straightforward expression of disappointment, disagreement, or distress. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this brief message. the elongated ""nooo"" is a common way to emphasize negative emotion in informal, online communication, but it doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. without additional context that might imply a contradictory or ironic meaning, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a genuine, non-sarcastic expression.",0.0

sarcastic

the context and punctuation strongly suggest that the moderator's response is indeed sarcastic. the drawn-out ""noo"" followed by a period, combined with the question about sarcasm, indicates that the moderator is using irony to imply the opposite of what they're literally saying. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the intended meaning contradicts the literal words.",1.0

sarcastic

this response is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the contrast between ""just mediate the group"" and ""give up every tuesday of my life"" suggests exaggeration and frustration.

2. referring to the group members as ""screwups"" is harsh and likely not sincere for a real moderator.

3. the phrase ""for the good of my health"" at the end is clearly ironic, as giving up time and dealing with difficult people would typically not be considered good for one's health.

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of the term ""sarcasmoholic"" to describe stewart, which is a playful neologism indicating excessive use of sarcasm.

",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i cannot confidently assign a label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this statement. the text ""moderator: noo.."" is too brief and lacks sufficient context to determine whether it's sarcastic or not. 

the elongated ""noo.."" could be expressing genuine disappointment or disagreement, or it could potentially be a sarcastic response, but without more context about the situation or preceding conversation, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the ambiguity of the short statement, i would lean towards labeling it as ""not sarcastic"" by default, but i want to emphasize that this classification is not made with high confidence due to the limited information available.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the content and structure of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

6. this type of dialogue is characteristic of chandler's sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"".

not sarcastic

explanation:
while chandler's statement shows frustration and a sudden shift from thinking to not caring, it doesn't exhibit clear markers of sarcasm. the repetition of ""let me think!"" seems genuine, expressing an attempt to come up with an idea. the final ""oh, i don't care"" appears to be a genuine expression of giving up or losing interest rather than a sarcastic remark. the exclamations and informal tone are consistent with chandler's character (likely from the tv show ""friends"") but don't inherently indicate sarcasm in this context.",0.0
CHANDLER: The British are coming?,"PHOEBE: Hey you guys, guess what?
",FRIENDS,1,"considering the context and the punctuation information provided, i'll assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the sentence is short and ends with a question mark, which can often be a sign of sarcasm, especially when combined with an unexpected statement.
2. the phrase ""the british are coming"" is a famous historical warning, typically associated with paul revere's ride during the american revolution. using this phrase in a modern context, especially by a character like chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" is likely to be sarcastic.
3. chandler's character is known for his sarcastic humor, which further supports this interpretation.
4. without more context, the sudden mention of ""the british are coming"" seems out of place, suggesting it's probably a sarcastic comment in response to something else happening in the scene.

given these factors, it's highly likely that this line is meant to be sarcastic rather than a genuine question or statement.",1.0

CHANDLER: Really? Struck down in the prime of life.,"MONICA: Chandler, I think I am sick
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""really?"" at the beginning sets a skeptical or dubious tone, which is often a precursor to sarcasm.

"CHANDLER: I am not freaking out, why would I be freaking out? A woman named Hildy called and said we will get married, but that happens everyday","MONICA: I am so sorry, please stop freaking out.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. chandler's response is dripping with irony and employs several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. he denies ""freaking out"" while his entire response indicates he is, in fact, freaking out.

2. the rhetorical question ""why would i be freaking out?"" is used to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.

3. the statement ""but that happens everyday"" is blatantly false and used to sarcastically underscore how unusual and alarming the situation actually is.

4. the overall tone and exaggerated casualness about a clearly unusual event (a stranger calling to say they will get married) is a classic sarcastic technique.

given these elements and chandler's well-known sarcastic personality in the show ""friends,"" this response is definitely sarcastic.",1.0

5. there are no linguistic markers typically associated with sarcasm, such as exaggerated tone or contradictory statements.

 CHANDLER: Hey, where's the birthday girl?
 RACHEL: Oh she is still napping.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. chandler's statement is meant to be ironic and contradictory. the whole point of a surprise party is that the person it's for doesn't know about it. by saying ""she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening,"" chandler is using sarcasm to emphasize how impossible and absurd that scenario would be, given that it's supposed to be a surprise. the exaggerated language (""up all night excited"") further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0

 RACHEL: Just pass the tape along.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic, particularly the last sentence. chandler's statement ""and that's something they should learn on their own"" is a sarcastic quip implying that his bosses will eventually discover he's an idiot without his help. this dry, self-deprecating humor is characteristic of sarcasm, especially in the context of workplace dynamics and self-perception. the sarcasm serves to humorously underscore chandler's reluctance to recommend an unsuitable candidate while also poking fun at his own position and relationship with his superiors.",1.0

 PERSON: Is he alright out there by himself?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of the phrase ""you can't make this stuff up!"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this expression is often used ironically to emphasize how absurd or unbelievable a situation is, even though it's actually true.

2. the context of describing a situation with coincidental names (ernie as the older brother/caretaker) adds to the sarcastic tone.

3. the informal, animated style of speech and the exclamatory statement further support the sarcastic intent.

4. chandler, the speaker, is known for his sarcastic humor in the context of the show ""friends"" (though this wasn't explicitly stated in the cues, it's a well-known character trait).

these elements combine to create a statement that is meant to be taken as sarcastic commentary on an unusual or coincidental situation.",1.0

 ROSS: Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
 CHANDLER: Sure, nice.
 ROSS: Dude. You're married to my sister.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this line is almost certainly sarcastic. the exaggerated comparison between simply saying ""nice"" and ""virtually licking her"" is a clear use of sarcasm to emphasize how overblown the interpretation of his comment has become. chandler, a character known for his sarcastic wit in the tv show ""friends,"" is likely using this hyperbole to mock the idea that his simple compliment could be seen as overly effusive or inappropriate. the absurdity of equating a basic compliment with such an extreme action is a classic example of sarcastic humor.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the use of quotation marks around the word ""very"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm. this punctuation technique, often called ""scare quotes"" or ""air quotes"" when used in spoken language, typically implies that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying or is expressing skepticism about the term in quotes. 

additionally, chandler is a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends."" while this context wasn't explicitly provided, it aligns with the tone and style of the statement.

the combination of chandler's character tendency, the use of quotation marks, and the exaggerated enthusiasm expressed in the statement strongly suggests that this is a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine expression of excitement.",1.0
