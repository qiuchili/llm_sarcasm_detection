 SHELDON: My apologies. What's your plan?
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the context provided, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is attributed to sheldon, likely referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory,"" a character known for his sarcasm and difficulty with social cues.

2. the phrase ""it's just a privilege to watch your mind at work"" is overly grandiose and formal, which is often a marker of sarcasm, especially when contrasted with sheldon's typically blunt and literal communication style.

3. in the context of the show, sheldon often uses sarcasm to criticize others' intelligence or decision-making, and this statement fits that pattern.

4. the exaggerated praise (""privilege to watch your mind at work"") is likely meant to be interpreted as the opposite, implying that the person's thought process is actually flawed or slow.

while the punctuation cues don't provide much additional context, the content and character attribution strongly suggest this is a sarcastic statement.",1.0

 PENNY: That sounds interesting.
 HOWARD: You'll think about it?
",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement by penny appears to be a straightforward expression of concern or preoccupation. the informal tone, use of first-person perspective, and the expression of inability to stop thinking about something all point to a genuine sentiment rather than a sarcastic one. there are no clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrasting emotions that would typically be present in sarcastic statements. the lack of rhetorical devices or complex language structures further supports the interpretation that this is a sincere expression of penny's thoughts and feelings.",0.0
"SHELDON: Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.","LEONARD: Here we go. Pad thai, no peanuts.
 HOWARD: But does it have peanut oil?
 LEONARD: I'm not sure. Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this label is appropriate because:

1. the statement contains situational irony, as noted in the rhetorical device analysis. sheldon's casual offer of epinephrine outside of ""bee season"" creates a humorous contrast between a serious medical tool and an oddly specific time for its use.

2. the language style cues indicate a dry or deadpan humor, which is often associated with sarcasm.

3. the casual tone combined with scientific terminology (epinephrine) creates a juxtaposition that is characteristic of sarcastic humor, especially in the context of a character like sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory"" tv show).

4. the implication that epinephrine is only needed during ""bee season"" is an absurd oversimplification, which is a common technique in sarcastic statements.

while the sarcasm here is subtle and delivered in a matter-of-fact manner, the underlying humor and irony of the statement support classifying it as sarcastic.",1.0
"SHELDON: Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour, hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.","PENNY: A marathon? How many Superman movies are there?

 SHELDON: One.
 SHELDON: You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
 PENNY: Yes, I know, men can't fly.
 SHELDON: Let's assume that they can.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. contrast between expectations and reality: superman is supposed to save lois lane, but in this scenario, he accidentally kills her in a gruesome way.

2. use of scientific precision for a absurd outcome: the text uses exact physics calculations (32 feet per second per second, 120 miles per hour) to describe a ridiculous and impossible scenario.

3. dark humor: the morbid outcome of lois being ""sliced into three equal pieces"" is presented in a matter-of-fact way, which is characteristic of dark, sarcastic humor.

4. subversion of superhero tropes: it takes the common superhero rescue scenario and turns it on its head with an unexpected and horrific result.

5. tone: the clinical, almost detached way of describing such a gruesome outcome adds to the sarcastic nature of the statement.

this statement is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather to humorously critique the physics of superhero rescues, making it decidedly sarcastic.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the given text appears to be a straightforward hypothetical question posed by howard to sheldon, likely from a tv show dialogue (possibly ""the big bang theory"" given the character names). while the scenario described could potentially lead to a humorous or thought-provoking situation, the question itself doesn't contain inherent sarcasm. it's setting up a hypothetical scenario rather than making a sarcastic statement. the ellipsis at the end suggests the thought is incomplete, but there's no clear indicator of sarcastic intent in this partial statement alone.",0.0

 SHELDON: Could you be more specific?
 LEONARD: Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

this statement from sheldon is clearly sarcastic. the context suggests that he's commenting on someone's appearance, likely in response to a question about whether something is noticeable. by saying that the ""dark crescent-shaped patterns"" (likely referring to sweat stains) ""conceal it nicely,"" sheldon is using irony. these patterns would actually draw attention rather than conceal, and describing them as nicely concealing something is a sarcastic way of pointing out their obviousness.

the combination of sheldon's typically blunt character (if this is from ""the big bang theory"") and the use of precise, clinical language to describe something unflattering strongly indicates sarcasm. the statement is meant to be humorous through its contradiction and unexpected ""compliment"" that is actually a criticism.",1.0

 SHELDON: Nothing.
 LEONARD: Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
",BBT,1,"based on the content and context provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

explanation:
the text is clearly sarcastic. sheldon's proposed greeting to dr. gablehauser is filled with thinly veiled insults and backhanded compliments. he sarcastically says it's ""fortunate"" for dr. gablehauser to be hired, then proceeds to criticize his lack of original research, implies his books are overly simplified, and even makes a crude reference to bowel movements. this biting, ironic tone is characteristic of sheldon's character and is a prime example of sarcasm.",1.0

 SHELDON: We play teams, not one-on-one.
 SHELDON: One-on-one.
 LEONARD: The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. the use of hyperbole (""cut the foreigner in half""), dehumanization (""the foreigner""), and dark humor all contribute to a satirical tone. the casual suggestion of violence combined with the dismissive attitude towards human life (""there's a billion more where he came from"") is not meant to be taken literally. instead, it's using exaggeration and shock value to make a point, likely criticizing xenophobic or callous attitudes towards immigrants or foreigners. the sarcasm here serves to highlight the absurdity and inhumanity of such viewpoints.",1.0

 SHELDON: Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the irony identified in the rhetorical devices analysis, where ""i'm sorry, too"" is likely used insincerely.

2. the language style analysis noting a ""sarcastic or dismissive sentiment expressed.""

3. the context of sheldon (likely referring to the character from ""the big bang theory"" known for his sarcastic remarks) saying there's no room in his wallet, which could be a figurative way of refusing to give money or include someone.

4. the use of ""well,"" at the beginning, which often precedes a sarcastic or insincere statement.

5. the contrast between expressing sorrow (""i'm sorry"") and then immediately giving a reason that suggests he's not actually sorry at all.

these elements combined strongly suggest that this statement is meant to be understood as sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

 PENNY: I know the reason.
 LEONARD: We all know the reason.
 LEONARD: Sheldon, what are you getting at?
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

while sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory"" often speaks in a formal, precise manner and makes references to fictional characters, this particular quote does not appear to be sarcastic. given the context of sheldon's personality and interests, this seems to be a genuine expression of excitement at seeing someone who resembles a character from a book he's familiar with. the enthusiasm and wonder in the rhetorical question suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm.

therefore, i would label this as:

not sarcastic",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward, factual comment about powering down on saturdays.
2. there's no clear contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
3. the language style is casual and direct, which is consistent with sheldon's character (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory""), but doesn't indicate sarcasm.
4. there are no emotional words or clear rhetorical devices that might suggest sarcasm.
5. the context seems to be a technical or logistical discussion about a schedule or routine, which aligns with sheldon's typical interests and manner of speaking.

while sheldon's character is known for occasional sarcasm, this particular statement doesn't exhibit the typical markers of sarcastic speech. it appears to be a genuine observation or concern about having to power down on saturdays, likely in the context of a larger discussion about a schedule or technological system.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the response from sheldon contains clear sarcasm, particularly in his suggestion about a trash can spontaneously forming around the letter. this is a deliberately absurd statement used to emphasize the unlikelihood of such an event, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor. the cues also specifically mention this as an example of sarcasm in the text. additionally, sheldon's reference to occam's razor to contrast with this ridiculous scenario further reinforces the sarcastic tone of his statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the presence of verbal irony, as noted in the rhetorical devices cue. leonard says ""technically, yes"" but then immediately contrasts this with additional information.

2. the build-up and exclamation at the end (""but, if you'll notice... it's reversible!"") suggest a dramatic reveal that could be interpreted as playful or sarcastic.

3. the use of ""technically"" at the beginning often precedes a statement that is technically true but practically misleading or irrelevant, which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. the overall structure of the statement - affirming something and then immediately undercutting it - is a classic sarcastic pattern.

while the tone may seem neutral at first glance, the combination of these elements strongly suggests a sarcastic intent in leonard's statement.",1.0

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward, literal response from the character sheldon. the use of precise language, specialized vocabulary, and the formal tone are all consistent with sheldon's typical way of speaking in ""the big bang theory."" there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would suggest sarcasm. sheldon is likely genuinely referring to a scientific journal he's interested in, which aligns with his character's known interests and communication style.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the use of the phrase ""so weird"" is likely ironic, as pointed out in the rhetorical device cue. this suggests that penny doesn't actually find the situation weird, but is using sarcasm to imply something else.

2. the informal and conversational tone, combined with the expressive language (""so weird""), is often associated with sarcastic speech in casual settings.

3. the structure of the sentence, beginning with ""oh, you know,"" is a common preface to sarcastic statements in english.

4. the context implies a discrepancy in receiving items, which is a typical scenario where people might employ sarcasm to express frustration or disbelief.

5. the lack of genuine surprise or confusion in the statement, despite the words suggesting otherwise, strongly indicates a sarcastic tone.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this input text.",1.0

sarcastic

this response exhibits several key indicators of sarcasm:

1. it uses informal language typical of casual conversation.
2. the suggestion to sell something ""slightly used"" on ebay when it's likely significantly damaged or altered is a clear use of dry humor and sarcasm.
3. the phrase is brief and concise, which is common in sarcastic quips.
4. it proposes an unethical and absurd solution (selling a damaged item as ""slightly used""), which is often a hallmark of sarcastic suggestions.
5. the use of quotation marks around ""slightly used"" emphasizes the irony, as the item is likely far from slightly used.

the overall tone and content strongly suggest this is a sarcastic response, likely in the context of a conversation about what to do with a damaged or significantly altered item.",1.0

",BBT,1,"given the input and the cues provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the reason for this label is that while the text contains seemingly positive words like ""comfort"" and ""good,"" the overall message is inappropriate and insensitive. howard's suggestion to ""cop a feel"" while comforting someone who is emotionally vulnerable is a stark contrast to the apparent care being advised initially. this juxtaposition of seemingly caring advice with an ulterior motive creates a sarcastic tone. the sarcasm lies in the way it mocks the idea of genuine comfort by suggesting taking advantage of the situation for personal gratification.",1.0

the input text is a clear example of sarcasm. sheldon's statement is intentionally exaggerating and mocking the idea that two of something can be considered ""plenty."" by sarcastically suggesting that the dictionary definition of ""plenty"" should be changed to mean just ""two,"" he's emphasizing how inadequate he finds this quantity to be. this aligns perfectly with the explanation of sarcasm provided in the cues, making it a straightforward case of sarcastic speech.",1.0

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

the response ""not sarcastic"" is based on the following analysis:

1. direct language: sheldon's statement is straightforward and assertive, expressing a clear refusal without any hidden meanings or irony typically associated with sarcasm.

2. formal tone: the use of ""i am"" instead of ""i'm"" in the second part of the sentence suggests a formal, sincere tone rather than a sarcastic one.

3. absence of rhetorical devices: there are no evident rhetorical devices or figurative language that might indicate sarcasm.

4. consistent emotion: there's no emotional contrast in the statement, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic comments.

5. context: while we don't have full context, sheldon's character (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory"") is known for being direct and literal, making a non-sarcastic interpretation more likely.

6. polite refusal: the use of ""i'm sorry"" at the beginning indicates a polite refusal rather than a sarcastic remark.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of sheldon's unwillingness to return to the renaissance fair.",0.0

### label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is expressing frustration and disbelief that someone else was given an assistant, while he has to go to extreme measures (using wire cutters at a bank) just to get a new pen. the exaggeration and contrast between these two situations are classic indicators of sarcasm. the rhetorical question ""they gave him an assistant?"" followed by the absurd comparison further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0

1. the statement has a sarcastic tone, particularly in the suggestion of including an inhaler with a publication, which is not a typical practice.

2. the analysis of language style indicates a ""humorous or sarcastic implication"" in the text.

3. the rhetorical device analysis specifically identifies sarcasm as the primary device used in this statement.

4. the context of sheldon (likely referring to the character from ""the big bang theory"") often involves sarcastic or deadpan humor.

5. the juxtaposition of the formal act of publishing with the unexpected inclusion of an inhaler creates a humorous contrast typical of sarcastic remarks.

the text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. the contrast between ""sadly"" and ""lucky"" creates an ironic tone.
2. howard's statement about liking ""fashion models pruny and bug-eyed"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally, as these are generally not considered attractive features.
3. the overall structure of the statement sets up an expectation (mrs. wolowitz's sensitivity) and then subverts it with an absurd preference (liking pruny and bug-eyed models), which is a common sarcastic technique.

this line is clearly sarcastic. sheldon's comment about carpooling to federal prison is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a biting, sarcastic remark implying that the person he's speaking to has done something illegal. the use of ""how nice"" at the beginning sets up the sarcastic tone, which is then amplified by the exaggerated reference to federal prison.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. leonard's question about a ""blunt instrument"" being the focus of his ""murder trial"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's a darkly humorous and exaggerated response, likely to something innocuous. the sarcasm lies in the dramatic leap from what is probably a mundane situation to a hypothetical murder trial. this kind of hyperbole for comedic effect is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0

the text displays clear signs of sarcasm through howard's tone and word choice. the use of ""bff"" (best friend forever) in this context is likely not sincere, but rather a mocking way to express howard's feelings of jealousy or resentment towards leonard's new friendship with dave. the contrast between howard's apparent negativity and the implied positive relationship between dave and leonard further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the statement ""a lot of words sound like 'yoga'"" is clearly untrue and exaggerated, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

2. the cues mention the presence of irony, which is closely related to sarcasm.

3. the informal, conversational tone and the context of it being dialogue suggest this could be a humorous or sarcastic response in a conversation.

4. the speaker (leonard) seems to be making an excuse or deflection, rather than genuinely believing what he's saying, which aligns with sarcastic intent.

5. the cues describe it as a ""humorous or lighthearted comment,"" which is consistent with sarcasm.

while the sarcasm is subtle, the combination of the exaggerated claim and the likely context of it being an excuse or deflection strongly suggests that this statement is indeed sarcastic.",1.0

the input text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

1. irony: the use of ""enjoy"" in relation to not having electricity (due to not paying the bill) is ironic. typically, losing power would be inconvenient, not enjoyable.

2. understatement: referring to the lack of electricity as ""ambience"" is a humorously understated way to describe a power outage.

3. implied criticism: there's an implied criticism of the department of water and power's action, presented through sarcasm rather than direct complaint.

4. contrast between expectation and reality: the idea that a utility company would think a customer would ""enjoy"" the consequences of not paying their bill creates a humorous contrast.

these elements, combined with the overall tone and structure of the sentence, strongly indicate that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is using humor to comment on the unpleasant situation of having their power cut off.",1.0

the statement by sheldon exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the use of the word ""pointless"" to describe the conversation he's currently engaged in is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it's a dismissive and slightly exaggerated way to express his irritation with the interaction.

2. the overall tone of the statement is impatient and somewhat condescending, which aligns with sarcastic speech.

3. the precise time calculation (three hours, 11 minutes) followed by the dismissive comment about the conversation creates a contrast that is often present in sarcastic remarks.

4. sheldon's character (if this is from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor, which further supports this interpretation.

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""coffee"" suggests that penny is implying it means something other than its literal meaning.

2. the phrase ""that is so sweet"" is likely being used sarcastically to highlight the naivety of thinking ""coffee"" just means coffee.

3. there's a clear contrast between the literal interpretation of ""coffee"" and penny's implied, more worldly understanding of its potential euphemistic meaning.

4. the structure of the sentence, with the colon introducing penny's statement, sets up an expectation for a revealing or pointed comment, which is often a context for sarcasm.

5. the overall tone suggests penny is gently mocking someone's innocence or lack of awareness, which is a common form of sarcastic expression.

these elements combined strongly indicate that penny's statement is sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

4. the context doesn't suggest any reason for sheldon to be sarcastic about this particular interest.
5. the character sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his direct and often literal communication style, making a sincere statement more likely than a sarcastic one in this case.

sarcastic

the statement from sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's exaggerating the complexity and importance of waitressing at the cheesecake factory, a job that typically doesn't require extensive analysis or planning. this overstatement is a classic form of sarcasm, especially coming from a character like sheldon who is known for his intellectual snobbery. the contrast between the mundane nature of waitressing and the grandiose terms he uses (""complex socio-economic activity,"" ""great deal of analysis and planning"") creates the sarcastic tone.",1.0

sarcastic

this line appears to be a humorous, absurdist statement that combines everyday objects (toast) with science fiction concepts in an unexpected way. the reference to battlestar galactica and the exaggerated goal of destroying ""all the human toast"" suggests this is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a sarcastic or comedic remark. the character sheldon (likely from a tv show) seems to be using an over-the-top science fiction scenario to make a point or joke, which is characteristic of sarcastic humor.",1.0

 SHELDON: How would you put it?
 LEONARD: Yeah, okay, like you said.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. understatement: the use of understatement, as identified in the rhetorical devices cue, is a common feature of sarcasm. sheldon's reduction of romantic relationships and sexual intimacy to merely ""intercourse"" that requires ""an awful lot of trouble"" is a clear understatement of the emotional significance most people attribute to these experiences.

2. contrast: while not explicitly emotional, there's an implied contrast between the effort (""awful lot of trouble"") and the result (""intercourse""), which is characteristic of sarcastic statements.

3. character context: although not directly provided in the cues, the statement is attributed to sheldon, likely referring to the character sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory."" this character is known for his logical, often socially inappropriate comments that frequently come across as sarcastic, even when unintended.

4. tone: the casual dismissal of something many people consider important (relationships and intimacy) with the phrase ""seems like an awful lot of trouble"" carries a sarcastic tone.

5. word choice: the use of ""awful"" to describe the effort, combined with the clinical term ""intercourse,"" creates a humorous juxtaposition typical of sarcastic statements.

given these factors, the statement is best classified as sarcastic, even if the character might not intend it to be so, as it humorously understates and trivializes a complex human experience.",1.0

### label: sarcastic

the statement contains a mix of negative and positive sentiments, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker begins with a negative assessment (""not a great movie"") but then immediately contrasts it with a positive observation (""beautiful desert""). this juxtaposition of conflicting sentiments within a single statement is characteristic of sarcastic expression. the speaker appears to be using irony to highlight the contrast between the poor quality of the movie and the appealing visuals of the setting, suggesting a sarcastic tone overall.",1.0

explanation:

",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text contains clear sarcasm in the first part. the speaker initially says ""no, i mean princess leia,"" which is obviously not true in the context. they then immediately follow it with ""of course i mean bernadette,"" emphasizing the sarcastic tone of the first statement. this abrupt shift and use of ""of course"" is a common sarcastic device, indicating that the answer should have been obvious. the rest of the text appears sincere, but the opening sarcastic remark is enough to classify the overall statement as sarcastic.",1.0

reasoning:

2. the tone appears to be straightforward and confrontational, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the cues indicate an informal, colloquial language style, which is consistent with the direct use of this idiom.
4. the emotional analysis suggests frustration or annoyance, which aligns with the literal meaning of the phrase.
5. there's no clear contrast or incongruity between the words and their intended meaning, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

sarcastic

the statement exhibits classic elements of sarcasm, using exaggeration and unexpected juxtaposition to create humor. the speaker contrasts the serious nature of operating heavy machinery with leonard's alleged emotional instability, creating an absurd scenario. this exaggeration and unexpected connection between emotional state and heavy machinery operation is a hallmark of sarcastic commentary, used here to likely make a humorous point about leonard's current state or behavior.",1.0

 SHELDON: Windows 7 is much more use r- friendly than Windows Vista.
 SHELDON: I don't like that.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of a rhetorical question, which is a common device in sarcastic statements.
2. the phrase ""a bit of an overreaction"" is understated language often used sarcastically to imply something is actually a major overreaction.
3. the word ""overreaction"" itself suggests leonard finds the action excessive, but he's expressing this indirectly through sarcasm rather than stating it directly.
4. the informal, conversational tone is consistent with how sarcasm is often delivered in dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle and context-dependent, the combination of these elements strongly suggests that leonard is using sarcasm to express his opinion about someone's decision to look for a new city to live in.",1.0

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics that point towards sarcasm:

1. it uses hyperbole (""jews always go with chinese food"") as a rhetorical device, which is often associated with sarcasm.
2. the statement relies on a cultural stereotype, which is frequently used in sarcastic or humorous contexts.
3. the informal and humorous language style suggests this is likely from a sitcom or casual conversation where sarcasm is common.
4. the statement is presented as a matter-of-fact generalization, but it's clearly an exaggeration, which is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

while the statement doesn't use explicitly emotional language, the use of stereotyping and exaggeration for comedic effect strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic remark rather than a sincere observation.",1.0

 LEONARD: We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
",BBT,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and context provided, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

this line appears to be sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the implication in the question ""there a new girlfriend in there?"" suggests penny already knows or suspects there isn't one.
2. the follow-up comment ""'cause you might need one"" has a teasing or mocking tone, implying something negative about the person's current relationship status or ability to maintain a relationship.
3. the informal, blunt communication style often aligns with sarcastic delivery in dialogue.
4. the context suggests there's more to this conversation than what's explicitly stated, which is common in sarcastic exchanges.

the combination of the seemingly innocent question followed by the pointed suggestion creates a sarcastic effect, likely intended to provoke or tease the person being addressed.",1.0

 SHELDON: Hello.
 PERSON: Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.
 SHELDON: Yes.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. historical inaccuracy: it's highly unlikely that einstein, a serious scientist in the early 20th century, would have used or even known the term ""bitchin'"" which is modern slang.

2. anachronism: the use of ""bitchin'"" (a term that became popular in the 1950s-60s) to describe einstein's hopes in 1917 is deliberately anachronistic, creating a humorous contrast.

3. tone mismatch: the formal, scientific language used in the first part of the sentence (including the german title of einstein's paper) contrasts sharply with the casual, colloquial ""bitchin'"" at the end.

4. character context: if this is sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory,"" he's known for his formal speech patterns and scientific knowledge. him using ""bitchin'"" in this context is out of character and likely meant to be humorous.

5. irony: as noted in the cues, there's a clear ironic contrast between the serious scientific work and the casual slang term.

this combination of elements strongly indicates that the statement is meant to be sarcastic and humorous, not a serious historical claim.",1.0

1. the text appears to be a straightforward question without any obvious sarcastic elements.
2. the language style is described as informal, direct, and inquisitive, which is consistent with a genuine inquiry rather than sarcasm.
3. there are no clear emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices that might indicate sarcasm.
4. the lack of emotional words and the neutral tone of the question suggest it's a sincere request for information.
5. the context of discussing ongoing research and asking for clarification about something else (""so what is all this?"") seems to be a natural progression in a conversation without sarcastic undertones.

3. there's no clear indication of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that typically characterizes sarcasm.
4. the use of the phrase ""to make a long story short"" suggests amy is genuinely summarizing a longer explanation about her medical situation.
5. the specific medical terminology (""unusually firm cervix"") implies a sincere discussion of a real medical condition.

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of ""finally"" implies a long wait or previous failures, which can be a subtle indicator of sarcasm.
2. the phrase ""found yourself a keeper"" is often used ironically, especially when combined with ""finally.""
3. the informal and colloquial language style can sometimes mask sarcastic intent.

5. the lack of clear emotional contrasts and rhetorical devices doesn't rule out sarcasm, as sarcasm can be subtle and rely on context and tone.

 PENNY: Okay, we should, we should go.
 PERSON: Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the casual and humorous tone contrasts with the presumably serious intent of scientists wanting to discuss science.

2. the use of colloquial language like ""dudes"" when referring to scientists creates a mismatch between the formal nature of scientific discussion and the informal presentation.

3. the suggested topics (rocks, dinosaurs, and beavers) are presented in an oversimplified manner that doesn't align with the likely complex discussions actual scientists would want to have.

4. the phrase ""our friend the beaver"" adds an element of playful personification that seems out of place in a serious scientific context.

5. the overall structure of the question, presenting these topics as if they're childish or trivial, implies a mocking or sarcastic attitude towards the ""science dudes"" and their desire for discussion.

while the sarcasm is subtle, these elements combined suggest that howard is not sincerely presenting these as serious topics for scientific discussion, but rather making a joke at the expense of the scientists or the idea of such a discussion.",1.0

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone is described as dismissive or condescending, which often aligns with sarcastic speech.
2. there's a mention of potential sarcasm in the rhetorical devices section, even though it's noted that more context would be needed to confirm.
3. the statement itself has a mocking quality by suggesting that certain things (not specified in this snippet) belong in young girls' bedrooms, implying they are childish or immature.
4. sheldon, the speaker, is known in popular culture (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory"") for his sarcastic and often condescending remarks.

while the sarcasm is not extremely overt, the combination of tone, implication, and the character's typical speaking style suggests that this statement is likely meant to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward observation.",1.0

the text appears to be a fragment of a casual, informal conversation. while it's somewhat ambiguous without more context, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. the speaker seems genuinely unsure or hesitant (indicated by ""i don't know"" and the ellipsis), and then agrees to something (""yeah, sure""). the final question ""why not you?"" could be sincere rather than sarcastic. without stronger contextual clues or a more obvious contrast between literal and intended meaning, it's safer to classify this as not sarcastic.",0.0

this quote appears to be a humorous, sarcastic statement from the character sheldon. the juxtaposition of the justice league (a superhero team) with muppet baby costumes creates an absurd and comical situation. sheldon's matter-of-fact delivery of this ridiculous suggestion, indicated by words like ""obviously"" and ""we have no choice,"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone. the statement is meant to be humorous rather than sincere, making it a clear example of sarcasm.",1.0

 HOWARD: We're not quitting on Leonard.
",BBT,0,"based on my analysis of the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the contrast between acknowledging loyalty as ""admirable"" and then immediately suggesting to ""up the ante"" creates a tension that is characteristic of sarcasm.
2. the use of the rhetorical question ""but what if i were to up the ante?"" implies a manipulative or playful tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.
3. the formal language and elevated diction (""admirable"", ""up the ante"") combined with the short, direct sentences create a contrast that can be interpreted as sarcastic, especially given the character sheldon's typical manner of speaking in pop culture.
4. the overall structure of first praising loyalty and then immediately challenging it suggests a sarcastic or ironic approach to the situation.

while the sarcasm here is subtle, it's consistent with sheldon's character (assuming this is referencing sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"") to use such indirect and intellectualized forms of sarcasm or manipulation.",1.0

 SHELDON: Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the exaggerated and humorous way raj presents his points, especially the second one about mimosas ""kicking his little brown ass,"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

2. the emphasis on ""are"" in italics when discussing penises suggests an ironic or sarcastic tone.

3. the juxtaposition of a serious-sounding opening (""i'd like to raise two points"") with the unexpectedly crude content creates a humorous contrast typical of sarcastic statements.

4. the combination of discussing penises and the effects of alcohol in such a formal-sounding manner further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

this statement appears to be using humor and exaggeration to make light of the situation, which is a hallmark of sarcastic communication.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement by leonard appears to be a straightforward, supportive comment in what seems to be a conversation about identifying someone's problem. the language is direct, informal, and helpful, without any indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the phrase ""zero in on"" is used idiomatically to mean focusing on or identifying something precisely, which in this context is used literally rather than sarcastically. the overall tone is analytical and constructive, lacking the typical markers of sarcastic speech.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the language style cues indicate potential sarcasm or dry humor, which is characteristic of sheldon's personality (if this is from ""the big bang theory"" sitcom).

2. the rhetorical question ""who would have thought it?"" is often used sarcastically to express feigned surprise.

3. there's a contrast between sheldon's usual know-it-all attitude and his apparent admission of learning something, which suggests he might not be entirely sincere.

4. the emotional contrast between surprise/amazement and humility/pride further supports the sarcastic interpretation.

5. sheldon's character is known for his sarcastic remarks, especially when interacting with others he considers intellectually inferior.

while the statement could be interpreted as genuine surprise in isolation, given the context of sheldon's character and the linguistic cues, it's more likely to be a sarcastic comment.",1.0

sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using a crude, graphic description to mock or express disgust at leonard and howard's sister's relationship. the phrase ""that's got to be fun for you, huh?"" is a classic sarcastic setup, where the speaker is saying the opposite of what they actually mean. the vivid and intentionally unpleasant imagery that follows further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of litotes (""i'm not saying that you're not fun"") is often associated with sarcasm, as it's an indirect way of making a point.

2. the stark contrast between the litotes and the hyperbole (""you're the most fun person i know"") creates a sense of insincerity or exaggeration typical of sarcastic statements.

3. while the overall tone appears positive on the surface, the combination of these rhetorical devices suggests an underlying sarcastic intent.

4. sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant, and this statement seems to fit that pattern by excessively praising someone's ""fun"" nature immediately after indirectly suggesting they might not be fun.

the use of these contrasting rhetorical devices in such close proximity strongly indicates that amy is likely being sarcastic rather than genuinely complimentary.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

the question posed by person3 contains elements that strongly suggest sarcasm:

1. the use of ""i'm sorry"" at the beginning often indicates disbelief or surprise in a sarcastic context.
2. the combination of unexpected elements (sheldon buying a loom and learning to weave) is presented in a way that suggests the speaker finds this information surprising or absurd.
3. the question mark at the end, coupled with the tone of the statement, implies that the speaker is not genuinely asking for confirmation but rather expressing incredulity.

the presence of punctuation cues (apostrophe, question mark, and comma) aligns with typical sarcastic expressions. the overall context and phrasing strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic remark expressing disbelief or amusement at sheldon's unexpected actions.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. juxtaposition: the text uses a clear juxtaposition of serious medical requests with a trivial item (a mint), which is a common technique in sarcastic or humorous dialogue.

2. character context: the style of speech suggests this is from a character (sheldon) known for his peculiar and often unintentionally humorous way of speaking, which is frequently used for sarcastic or comedic effect in the context of the show.

3. unexpected combination: the unusual combination of requesting antibiotics, a vomiting inducer, and a mint in the same breath creates an absurd situation that is likely intended to be humorous rather than sincere.

4. formal language in casual setting: the use of precise medical terminology in what seems to be a casual conversation adds to the comedic and potentially sarcastic tone of the statement.

while the statement itself isn't inherently sarcastic in the traditional sense, the overall context and delivery suggest that this line is meant to be humorous and falls under the broader category of sarcasm in comedic writing.",1.0

the statement from sheldon exhibits clear sarcasm. he dramatically exaggerates the significance of someone drinking from leonard's glass, sarcastically suggesting it's so momentous that it would be engraved on his tombstone. this hyperbolic reaction to a minor event is a classic example of sarcastic humor, likely characteristic of sheldon's personality in the show.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i don't have enough context to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the text appears to be a fragment of a larger conversation or explanation, likely from the character sheldon (possibly from the tv show ""the big bang theory"").

without more context, it's difficult to ascertain the intent behind this statement. sheldon is known for his literal and often technical explanations, so this could simply be a straightforward analogy. however, sarcasm can't be ruled out entirely without knowing the full context of the conversation.

given the limited information, i would lean towards labeling this as:

not sarcastic

this is because:
1. the statement appears to be an explanation or definition.
2. it uses a clear analogy (""like a heart attack"") which is common in non-sarcastic explanations.

3. the overall context implies amy is making a sardonic comment about someone's actions, using sarcasm to express her irritation.

5. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""when you're done..."" followed by a directive, is a common format for sarcastic comments.

the statement from sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's making a joke about the stereotypical association between not having a girlfriend and playing dungeons & dragons. the sarcasm lies in his exaggerated concern that if not having a girlfriend becomes a reason not to play the game, it would be in ""serious trouble"" - implying humorously that many d&d players don't have girlfriends. this kind of dry, deadpan humor is typical of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory,"" where he often makes sarcastic remarks without fully realizing their social implications.",1.0

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements, as identified in the cues. sheldon's comment about putting someone back on a list, combined with the exaggerated reference to an outdated storage medium (5.25-inch floppy disk), creates a sarcastic tone. this sarcasm is characteristic of sheldon's character and is used to create humor in the dialogue.",1.0

the statement ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself"" perfectly matches the emotional contrast described in the cues. it highlights the irony of someone being quick to identify betrayal in others while being oblivious to their own potentially betraying actions. this contrast between perceiving others' faults and lacking self-awareness is a classic hallmark of sarcasm, especially when delivered in a pointed manner as this statement appears to be.",1.0

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input based on the provided cues and the content of sheldon's statement. the quote clearly demonstrates sarcasm through its hyperbolic and dismissive tone about nobel prizes, which aligns with the cues mentioning a sarcastic tone and the use of hyperbole as a rhetorical device. the statement is a classic example of sheldon's character voice, which is described as direct and opinionated, using scientific references to express criticism in a biting, sarcastic manner.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon's use of understatement to describe a startled reaction is intentionally humorous. the phrase ""nothing quite like"" typically introduces something exciting or dramatic, but it's followed by an extremely understated description of being startled. this contrast between the expectation set up by the opening phrase and the deliberately underwhelming description that follows is a classic sarcastic technique. the exaggerated understatement serves to highlight the absurdity of the situation, making it a prime example of sarcasm.",1.0

explanation:
the statement ""oh, my god, that's where i know you from."" is a straightforward expression of sudden recognition or realization. the use of ""oh, my god"" as an exclamation indicates genuine surprise, and the rest of the sentence conveys a sincere moment of understanding. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm. the tone and content align with a genuine, non-sarcastic utterance in a casual conversation.",0.0

sarcastic

the character sheldon's response exhibits clear sarcastic elements. the sudden realization that he has been fooled, followed by the self-deprecating incomplete phrase ""oh, how could i be so stu..."" (presumably ""stupid""), strongly indicates a sarcastic tone. sheldon is likely expressing frustration and embarrassment through this sarcastic self-criticism, emphasizing his disbelief at falling for a ""ruse."" the incomplete nature of the final word adds to the sarcastic effect, as if he's dramatically cutting himself off mid-self-insult.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

bernadette's statement is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""great"" at the end is not sincere, but rather a sarcastic agreement that contrasts with her actual opinion. the comparison to ""an orange traffic cone"" is a negative one, implying that the item in question (likely an article of clothing) is unattractive or garish. the overall tone, as mentioned in the cues, is indeed sarcastic and mildly critical, further confirming this classification.",1.0

this statement from sheldon exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. it uses dark humor and crude references to body parts for comedic effect.
2. the tone is mockingly casual about an uncomfortable topic.
3. there's an implied criticism or judgment in the statement, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone of the statement is straightforward and mildly disappointed, without any indicators of sarcasm or irony.
2. the language used is casual and conversational, which is typical for sincere speech.
3. the phrase ""that's too bad"" expresses genuine disappointment about a missed opportunity.
4. the suggestion about spending new year's eve together seems to be a sincere alternative that penny is proposing.
5. there's no evidence of exaggeration, contradiction, or unexpected twists that are often present in sarcastic statements.

sarcastic

the statement ""you want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year"" carries a sarcastic tone. it implies that scientists' fashion choices are not typically considered interesting or varied, and the idea of viewing them as if they were a fashion show is meant to be humorous. the context suggests that leonard is making a joke about the typically mundane or unfashionable attire associated with scientists, which is a common stereotype used for comedic effect, especially in sitcoms or casual conversations about academic settings.",1.0

 PENNY: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

explanation:
the text displays clear sarcasm, particularly in sheldon's dismissive attitude towards biology. despite acknowledging that the news sounded important and was an achievement, he undermines its significance by describing biology as being about ""yucky, squishy things."" this contrast between the importance of the news and the childish, derogatory description of the field demonstrates a sarcastic tone, especially considering that biology is a respected scientific discipline. the use of words like ""yucky"" and ""squishy"" in reference to a scientific achievement further emphasizes the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0

 PENNY: Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.
",BBT,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the conversational tone and context suggest this is likely a humorous or witty response.
2. the mention of a ""pocket watch"" seems anachronistic and out of place, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic comments.
3. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""no, but maybe..."" implies a contradictory or unexpected suggestion, which is common in sarcastic remarks.
4. while there are no explicit emotional words, the implication of the statement seems to be mocking or poking fun at someone's preferences.
5. the character name ""sheldon"" is often associated with a character known for dry wit and sarcasm in popular culture (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory"").

without more context, it's impossible to be certain, but the combination of these factors strongly suggests this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

sarcastic

the question ""have you ever tried it?"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic, as leonard is implying that the person he's talking to would have experience having sex with themselves, which is absurd and impossible. this sarcastic remark is used to create humor and possibly deflect from the compliment he just gave about sex with the other person being ""pretty great.""",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the text contains a clear subversion of expectations, which is a common element of sarcasm. a neck massage is typically expected to be relaxing and pleasant, but here it's described in an absurdly negative way.

2. the use of an exaggerated, vivid metaphor (""like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest"") to describe the massage further supports the sarcastic tone. this hyperbole is often employed in sarcastic statements for comedic effect.

3. the question format, ending with a question mark, suggests a rhetorical question, which is frequently used in sarcastic comments.

4. the emotional contrast pointed out in the cues between the expected pleasant experience and the described unpleasant sensation is a classic setup for sarcasm.

5. the context implied by ""leonard:"" at the beginning suggests this is likely part of a dialogue, possibly from a sitcom or similar context where sarcastic banter is common.

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is known for his intelligence and arrogance, and he's using a common (but inaccurate) myth about einstein failing math to justify his own perceived lack of challenge. the sarcasm lies in the absurdity of sheldon comparing himself to einstein and using a false premise to explain away any potential shortcomings. the combination of sheldon's character traits, the reference to einstein, and the use of a well-known misconception all contribute to the sarcastic tone of this statement.",1.0

the phrase ""oh, screw her"" is a clear expression of dismissiveness or contempt, which is often associated with sarcastic speech. the follow-up statement ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" has a condescending tone that further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment. the speaker is not genuinely expressing that the person is lucky, but rather implying that they are doing this person a favor by allowing them to be part of their group. this combination of dismissiveness, contempt, and false graciousness is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
while the statement does contain a contrast between disappointment and interest, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. sheldon's response seems genuine. the use of ""darn"" expresses sincere disappointment, and the conditional statement that follows indicates a real desire to include the person if circumstances were different. this kind of straightforward expression is consistent with sheldon's character (assuming this is sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory""), who often struggles with sarcasm and tends to be direct in his communication. the statement lacks the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm.",0.0

i believe this label is reliable based on the given context and cues. sheldon's statement is clearly sarcastic, contrasting the extraordinary nature of talking to someone in space with the mundane experience of talking to someone at a local coffee shop. the sarcasm stems from his frustration with technical issues (walkie-talkie static) that diminish what should be an awe-inspiring experience. this aligns perfectly with the emotional contrast described in the cues, highlighting the gap between the expected excitement of space communication and the disappointing reality due to technical problems.",1.0

 PENNY: He looked at me like this.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the language style information indicates a sarcastic or humorous tone in the statement.
2. the phrase ""if that's all it takes"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is not as simple as suggested.
3. the conclusion ""it's a good thing you don't have a dog"" appears to be an ironic statement, implying that having a dog would actually make the situation worse or more complicated, which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.
4. the overall structure of the sentence, starting with ""well,"" and using a conditional statement followed by an ironic conclusion, is typical of sarcastic remarks in casual conversation.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this input text.",1.0

",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic."" 

this statement by penny is likely meant to be humorous and not entirely serious. the personification of the limbic system, giving it human desires and actions, is a clear indicator of sarcasm. by attributing a complex human desire to a specific part of the brain, penny is using exaggeration and humor to express attraction or desire in a witty, indirect way.

the use of scientific terminology (limbic system) in conjunction with a crude action (taking pants off) creates a comical contrast that is characteristic of sarcastic humor. it's an unconventional and playful way of expressing attraction, rather than a literal statement about brain function.

this kind of statement is typical of sitcom dialogue, where characters often use clever, exaggerated, or unexpected phrasing for comedic effect. the sarcasm here lies in the absurdity of the statement and the humorous way it expresses a basic human impulse.",1.0

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of the hyperbolic phrase ""out of this world"" to describe a comic book store seems exaggerated and potentially mocking.

3. the brevity and punchy nature of the statement is often characteristic of sarcastic remarks.
4. the double meaning of ""out of this world"" (as both a compliment and a space reference) suggests a playful, potentially sarcastic tone.
5. without more context, the enthusiasm expressed seems somewhat over-the-top for describing a comic book store, which could indicate sarcasm.

the use of understatement in sheldon's description of wil wheaton as a ""minor celebrity"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this is especially true given sheldon's known admiration for star trek and wil wheaton's role in it. the additional comment ""once you explain who he is, many people recognize him"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, as it humorously downplays wheaton's fame while simultaneously acknowledging it. this type of dry, understated humor is characteristic of sarcasm, particularly in the context of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory.""",1.0

this text appears to be a straightforward statement without any indicators of sarcasm. howard is describing a situation where someone was consistently sad, and he claims he was able to cheer her up, along with ice cream (alluding to ben & jerry's). the tone is casual and somewhat self-congratulatory, but it doesn't contain the irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. the humor at the end with the ice cream reference is more of a light-hearted addition rather than a sarcastic comment. therefore, based on the content and style of the text, as well as the cues provided, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. implied humor: the connection between crayons and crossing legs suggests an embarrassing or unusual incident without explicitly stating it, which is a common sarcastic technique.

2. exaggeration: the idea that seeing crayons would cause such a specific physical reaction (crossing legs) is likely an exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. unexpected association: linking crayons (typically associated with childhood innocence) with a gesture implying discomfort or embarrassment creates a surprising contrast, which is often used in sarcastic humor.

4. casual delivery of an absurd statement: the use of ""anyway"" to introduce such an unusual statement adds to the sarcastic tone, as it presents the bizarre information as if it were commonplace.

5. self-deprecating humor: the speaker is sharing a personal, potentially embarrassing anecdote in a way that invites laughter, which is a common form of sarcastic self-expression.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that penny's statement is intended to be sarcastic, using humor to potentially deflect from or make light of a past embarrassing situation.",1.0

2. there's no evident contrast between conflicting emotions, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. ironic use of ""decency"": bernadette sarcastically refers to her restraint as ""decency,"" implying that barely holding back negative comments until someone leaves is a high moral standard.

3. exaggeration: the suggestion to ""go to red lobster and talk about it"" seems like an overly dramatic response to whatever situation they're discussing, likely meant to highlight the absurdity of pretending they weren't all thinking the same thing.

the text displays subtle but clear sarcastic undertones. the speaker's statement combines gratitude with a hint of weariness or mild annoyance, particularly evident in the mention of the ""20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks."" this juxtaposition of polite thanks with an implied criticism of a lengthy, unsolicited lecture on an arguably trivial topic is a classic hallmark of sarcasm.

the casual language (""gonna""), the list-like structure of thanks, and the unexpected inclusion of the monster truck lecture all contribute to a tone that's not overtly hostile but gently mocking. the speaker seems to be using politeness to mask their desire to leave a situation they find tedious or amusing in its earnestness.

2. the question about ""difficulty initiating a stream of anything"" is a euphemistic and indirect way of asking about urination problems, which is often used for comedic effect.

3. the overly formal and awkward phrasing (""does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"") contrasts with the casual start of the dialogue, creating a humorous juxtaposition typical of sarcastic or comedic speech.

4. the character's apparent eagerness to guess about potentially embarrassing medical issues also adds to the sarcastic tone.

these elements combined strongly indicate that the speaker is being sarcastic, likely for comedic effect in the context of a tv show or movie script.",1.0

 PENNY: Aw, did she hate you?
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the emotional cues provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the contrast between the negative description of the sweater (""ugly, itchy"") and the claim of being ""her favorite"" creates a clear ironic tone.

2. the comparison between receiving a sweater and his brother receiving a car further emphasizes the sarcasm. the disparity in gifts suggests that leonard was not actually the favorite.

3. the question ""why?"" at the beginning implies that leonard is responding to someone else's statement or question, likely about whether he was treated unfairly. his response is sarcastic, using irony to highlight the unfairness of the situation while claiming the opposite.

4. the use of ""favorite"" at the end, after describing clear evidence to the contrary, is a classic sarcastic technique of stating the opposite of what is clearly true.

this statement is a clear example of sarcasm, where leonard is using irony to express his dissatisfaction with the treatment he received compared to his brother.",1.0

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration or disappointment rather than sarcasm. the emotional words ""can't believe"" and ""wasted"" indicate sincere regret about the time spent on hulk costumes. there's no clear irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically characterize sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a straightforward complaint about a perceived waste of effort, which aligns with the ""not sarcastic"" classification.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the analysis of the given cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the sentence is a straightforward question without any obvious sarcastic indicators.
2. the language style is described as informal and colloquial, which is common in everyday speech and doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.
3. there are no clear emotional contrasts or strong emotional words that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the question doesn't contain any exaggeration, irony, or unexpected twists that are often associated with sarcastic statements.
5. without additional context, the question appears to be a genuine inquiry about what the speaker was expected to do at home.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle and context-dependent, there's not enough evidence in this single sentence to confidently label it as sarcastic. therefore, ""not sarcastic"" seems to be the most appropriate label based on the available information.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. there's a stark contrast between the initial considerate gesture (picking up a cake or pie) and the subsequent insensitive remark about insulting someone's faith.

2. the phrase ""an insult to her faith is always thoughtful"" is inherently contradictory and clearly not meant to be taken literally. this is a classic hallmark of sarcasm.

3. the use of ""always"" in this context further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, as it exaggerates the supposed ""thoughtfulness"" of insulting someone's faith.

4. the juxtaposition of a genuine kind act (bringing a dessert) with an obviously unkind one (insulting faith) creates the irony typical of sarcastic statements.

these elements, combined with the contextual cues provided, strongly indicate that this statement is indeed sarcastic.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the context and cues strongly support this classification. penny's statement uses sarcasm to mock the idea of finding clues in an unlikely place (inside a beer in the fridge). the interjection ""ooh"" and the exaggerated enthusiasm for checking an absurd location for clues further reinforce the sarcastic tone. this is a clear example of using humor and irony to comment on the situation, which are key elements of sarcasm.",1.0

 RAJ: Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. contrast between trivial positives and broader implications: penny is using minor positives (non-flat beer and physical appearance) to sarcastically comment on her overall life situation.

2. exaggeration: equating these small details to her entire future being ""great"" is an overstatement typical of sarcasm.

3. understated tone: the matter-of-fact way of presenting these observations as significant life achievements adds to the sarcastic effect.

4. implied criticism: there's an underlying critique of societal expectations or personal anxieties about aging and success.

5. humor through incongruity: the juxtaposition of beer quality and physical attributes with life satisfaction creates a humorous effect characteristic of sarcasm.

the emotional contrast cue also supports this interpretation, highlighting the use of humor to contrast present contentment with potential future concerns. this aligns well with the sarcastic tone of the statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement contains a sudden, exaggerated shift from an implied normal state to an extreme characterization (""demented sex pervert""). this abrupt contrast and the provocative, judgmental tone are strong indicators of sarcasm. sheldon's question is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather to express disapproval or shock in an exaggerated, sarcastic manner.",1.0

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic."" here's why:

1. the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.

2. the phrase ""let the dead man talk"" appears to be used literally in this context, possibly referring to someone who has passed away or is metaphorically ""dead"" in some way.

3. the follow-up question ""so, why do you think that?"" is straightforward and seems to be genuinely seeking information or explanation.

4. the punctuation and language style are consistent with a serious, direct conversation rather than a sarcastic exchange.

5. there's no clear contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

6. the emotional tone, while potentially serious or somber, doesn't indicate sarcasm.

while the phrase ""let the dead man talk"" could be interpreted as figurative language, it doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm in this context. the overall tone and structure of the dialogue suggest a serious inquiry rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

 SHELDON: Leonard, I could use your assistance.
 LEONARD: Sure. What's up?

the input text appears to be a straightforward, sincere question from sheldon. he's expressing genuine uncertainty and seeking professional advice after abandoning his previous field of study. the language is direct and inquiring, without any indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the emotional cues (struggling, promising) and the formal yet slightly casual language style further support that this is a genuine request for guidance rather than a sarcastic statement.",0.0

 LEONARD: That's a rude thing to say. Out loud.
 SHELDON: It's an outrage.
Honestly, I'm tempted to leave the university.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by howard exhibits clear sarcastic tone. the use of ""exciting opportunities"" in the context of ""home care for the old and fat"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. howard is not genuinely suggesting this as a positive career move, but rather using mockery to make a point or respond to someone else's idea. the contrast between the positive descriptor ""exciting"" and the less glamorous description of the work creates the sarcastic effect. this aligns with the cues mentioning the sarcastic tone and the presence of sarcasm as a rhetorical device in the text.",1.0

 SHELDON: I don't know. Perhaps.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the contrast between amy's initial hopeful suggestion and the abrupt shift in tone with ""oh, sure"" at the end strongly indicates sarcasm. the ellipses and dashes in the text also suggest hesitation and a change in thought process, further supporting the sarcastic interpretation of the final phrase. the cues highlighting this contrast and the complex emotional situation reinforce this assessment.",1.0

 SHELDON: I don't know. Perhaps.
 AMY: And if it turns out you don't...
",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the dialogue excerpt clearly demonstrates sheldon's use of sarcasm to express his frustration and disagreement. his exaggerated suggestions of engagement, getting a house, and starting a family are not sincere proposals, but rather a sarcastic way to mock the idea he's responding to. the final exclamation ""do you hear yourself, woman?!"" further emphasizes his disbelief and opposition to the original suggestion, confirming the sarcastic nature of his entire response.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

the statement clearly exhibits sarcastic undertones. amy's comparison of her three-year relationship with someone else's brief encounter, coupled with the exaggerated description of the man ""taking his pants off,"" indicates a bitter, jealous sentiment expressed through sarcasm. the use of ""nothing"" to describe her own lengthy relationship further emphasizes the sarcastic contrast. this aligns with the cues mentioning disappointment, frustration, jealousy, and resentment, which are all effectively conveyed through the sarcastic tone of the statement.",1.0

 RAJ: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

i believe this label is correct based on the following reasoning:

1. the content is clearly not meant to be taken literally. sheldon's ""plan"" is absurd and counterproductive, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. the statement aligns with the cues provided, particularly:
   - informal and colloquial language
   - direct and blunt phrasing
   - sarcastic or humorous tone
   - short, simple sentences
   - step-by-step format
   - potentially offensive content (mentioning genital warts)

3. the juxtaposition of opening a comic book store and then immediately trying to sabotage it with a harmful rumor is deliberately ridiculous, which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. this statement fits sheldon's character (assuming it's sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory""), who often makes socially inappropriate or sarcastic comments.

given these factors, the statement is clearly intended to be sarcastic rather than a sincere suggestion.",1.0

rationale:
1. the statement appears to be a sincere expression of howard's feelings about buying a comic book store.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.
3. the language style is straightforward and emphasizes the importance of the action to the speaker.
4. the use of ""that's how much ... means to me"" typically indicates genuine sentiment rather than sarcasm.

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward dialogue without any indicators of sarcasm.
2. penny is addressing emily directly and seriously about a past event involving raj.
3. the language style is described as informal and conversational, but not sarcastic.
4. there are no emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices that might suggest sarcasm.
5. the context implies a potentially serious or sensitive conversation, which is unlikely to involve sarcasm.

 PENNY: Oh, that's so sweet.

",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this text is indeed sarcastic. the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the initial compliment and the crude implication that follows. raj starts with a seemingly sincere compliment about the women's attractiveness, but then immediately undercuts it with a boastful and inappropriate comment about sleeping with both of them. 

the use of ""kind of says something about the man..."" is a sarcastic way of drawing attention to himself and his supposed prowess, rather than genuinely praising the women. this abrupt shift from flattery to self-aggrandizement creates the sarcastic tone, using false modesty to actually brag.

the cues provided, particularly the emotional contrast and the keywords, support this interpretation. the sarcasm is subtle but present in the way raj turns a compliment into a self-serving remark.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

the statement ""i don't need a reason-- it's my house"" appears to be a direct, assertive declaration rather than a sarcastic remark. the speaker (howard) is using a straightforward, forceful tone to assert his authority or ownership, which is characteristic of a non-sarcastic statement in this context. the brevity and lack of irony or hidden meaning further support this classification as not sarcastic.",0.0

sarcastic

this statement by raj is indeed sarcastic. the use of ""boy"" as an exclamation, followed by a statement that playfully exaggerates the negative impact of meeting bernadette on the field of robotics, is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the comment is meant to tease, likely implying that the person being addressed (presumably howard) became less focused on robotics after meeting bernadette. this kind of exaggerated, teasing statement is a classic example of sarcasm in casual conversation.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward request from howard to not discuss a topic in front of others.
2. there's no apparent contrast between what is said and what is meant, which is often a key feature of sarcasm.
3. the tone appears cautious and diplomatic, rather than mocking or ironic.
4. the language is direct and literal, without any obvious exaggeration or irony that might indicate sarcasm.
5. the implied emotions (discomfort, caution) are consistent with the literal meaning of the statement, not contradictory as they might be in a sarcastic comment.

the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. positive reframing of a negative situation: penny is trying to find a silver lining in what appears to be a disappointing experience.

2. contrast between expectation and reality: the phrase ""maybe it's a good thing we came here"" implies that the visit was actually not good, but penny is ironically presenting it as beneficial.

3. use of ""like"": the comparison ""it's like a lesson in what not to do"" is a classic sarcastic structure, using an analogy to emphasize the negative aspects of the experience.

4. subtle emotional contrast: there's an implied disappointment with the place visited, contrasted with the ostensibly positive framing of the experience as a learning opportunity.

5. tone: the overall tone suggests penny is making light of a bad situation through humor, which is a common use of sarcasm.

given these cues, particularly the ironic positive spin on a presumably negative experience, this statement is most likely sarcastic.",1.0

the text demonstrates several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. unexpected comparison: it equates a common action (getting out of a car) with an uncommon and potentially embarrassing situation (not wearing underwear).

2. exaggeration: it implies that ""all of us"" routinely exit vehicles without underwear, which is clearly an overstatement.

3. deadpan delivery: the statement is made in a matter-of-fact tone, as if it's discussing something ordinary, which contrasts with the absurdity of the content.

4. social commentary: it's likely poking fun at celebrity culture or paparazzi incidents where celebrities have been photographed in compromising situations while exiting vehicles.

5. shared cultural knowledge: it relies on the audience understanding the reference to celebrity wardrobe malfunctions, which is a common subject of gossip and jokes.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically rather than literally, making ""sarcastic"" the appropriate label.",1.0

the statement by bernadette employs visual imagery in a humorous and unexpected way, creating an absurd mental picture that is clearly not meant to be taken literally. the use of a respected scientist in an incongruous and somewhat risqué scenario is a classic example of sarcasm, used to make a point or joke in an exaggerated manner. this kind of hyperbolic imagery is a common technique in sarcastic humor.",1.0

the use of the star trek allusion ""where no man has gone before"" in this context is likely meant ironically. howard is probably commenting on someone doing something foolish, embarrassing, or ill-advised rather than actually praising an unprecedented achievement. the contrast between the grandiose, heroic connotations of the star trek quote and what is likely a mundane or negative situation creates the sarcastic tone.",1.0

4. the use of humor (pun between tribble and toupee) doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm, but rather playful language.
5. the informal, conversational style suggests sincerity rather than sarcastic intent.

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the use of ""apparently"" suggests skepticism or irony about the situation being described.
2. the phrase ""awfully flirty"" is an exaggeration that implies criticism or disapproval, typical of sarcastic remarks.
3. the deliberate vagueness in referring to people as ""someone"" and ""another someone"" creates a mocking tone.
4. the overall structure of the explanation, which sounds overly complicated for a simple situation, contributes to the sarcastic effect.
5. the contrast between the serious topic (engagement) and the casual, almost flippant way it's described adds to the sarcastic tone.

therefore, while the sarcasm is not extremely overt, it's present enough in the subtext and delivery to classify this statement as sarcastic.",1.0

 PENNY: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics that strongly suggest sarcasm:

1. the use of ""wow"" as an exaggerated expression of surprise.
2. the contrast between ""still have it"" and the assumption that follows, which is deliberately exaggerated and unlikely.
3. the vivid and specific imagery of something being ""balled up in the corner of a barn,"" which is an absurd and humorous exaggeration.
4. the informal and colloquial tone, which often accompanies sarcastic remarks.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic comment that likely implies the opposite of what is literally stated, suggesting that bernadette is surprised the item in question is still in good condition or still exists at all.",1.0

SHELDON: I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.,"LEONARD: Okay, why?
",BBT,1,"label: sarcastic

based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe this statement is sarcastic. the irony and paradox identified in the rhetorical devices cue strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. sheldon's comment about wondering how he'll sleep without the snoring is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, as snoring is typically considered disruptive to sleep. the situational irony and the paradoxical nature of finding comfort in a usually annoying sound further support the sarcastic interpretation. while there are elements of attachment and fondness implied, the overall context and sheldon's character (if this is referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"") make it more likely that this is a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine expression of affection.",1.0
"AMY: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it.","AMY: It's nice they're getting exercise.

 SHELDON: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.
 AMY: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the last sentence of amy's statement strongly suggests sarcasm. while the rest of the dialogue is straightforward, the final remark ""look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it"" is likely a sarcastic comment. 

this statement implies that most of the dashboard is covered in syrup, and amy is sarcastically pointing out the small area that isn't messy. the use of exaggeration (implying that nearly the entire dashboard is covered) and the unexpected juxtaposition of syrup on a car dashboard contribute to the sarcastic tone.

the cues also support this interpretation, mentioning that the last sentence could potentially be interpreted as sarcasm or irony, and noting the humorous or sarcastic implication in the language style analysis.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the response from howard uses exaggerated, figurative language that is characteristic of sarcasm. the metaphor of being in a ""trap"" and threatening to ""chew my leg off"" is an over-the-top way of expressing frustration with a conversation that won't end. this hyperbolic expression is a classic sarcastic technique used to emphasize how tedious or unbearable the speaker finds the situation, rather than a literal statement of intent.",1.0

 BERNADETTE: Uh-huh.
",BBT,1,"based on the context provided and the cues extracted, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
this statement from bernadette is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""and i love that..."" followed by a description of an unfair distribution of responsibilities (working and doing all the cleaning) indicates that she doesn't actually love this situation. the phrase ""and you're okay with that"" at the end further emphasizes her dissatisfaction with the arrangement. the sarcasm is used to point out the inequity in their household duties, likely directed at her partner who isn't contributing to the cleaning despite bernadette also working.",1.0

 LEONARD: Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement is not sarcastic. while it contains exaggeration and a somewhat absurd example (the barn spider laying eggs), it's consistent with sheldon's character to be overly cautious and to list unlikely but theoretically possible medical complications. the tone is genuinely concerned and informative, albeit in an exaggerated way. sheldon's tendency to overanalyze and his lack of social awareness often lead him to make such statements in earnest, without sarcastic intent.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it begins with a positive statement (""i love that you take pride in your looks""), but then immediately contrasts it with a frustrating situation (""even when i have to pee in the morning, and you're in there spending an hour on your hair"").

2. the emotional contrast between love/pride and frustration/impatience, as noted in the cues, is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

3. the exaggeration of ""spending an hour on your hair"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

4. the structure of the sentence, starting with a compliment and then undercutting it with a complaint, is a common sarcastic format.

therefore, while bernadette may genuinely appreciate her partner's attention to appearance, the overall tone and structure of the statement strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment expressing frustration with the inconvenience caused by this behavior.",1.0

explanation:
the statement by sheldon is a straightforward use of a common saying. while the phrase ""all good things must come to an end"" can sometimes be used sarcastically, in this context there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. the formal tone, the use of a well-known proverb, and the lack of any contradictory or exaggerated elements suggest that sheldon is likely using this phrase sincerely to comment on something positive ending. the cues provided, particularly the language style information and the lack of emotional contrast, support a non-sarcastic interpretation of this statement.",0.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using exaggerated self-deprecation by calling himself a ""dummy"" and implying that a blanket is ""complicated."" the juxtaposition of someone being too unintelligent to handle something as simple as a blanket is a classic sarcastic technique, using irony to emphasize the absurdity of the statement. the keywords ""dummy,"" ""handle,"" ""complicated,"" and ""blanket"" all contribute to this sarcastic tone.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the sentence appears to be a straightforward question without any obvious markers of sarcasm.
2. the language style is described as conversational and casual, which doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.
3. there are no clear emotional contrasts or strong emotional words that might suggest sarcastic intent.
4. the question seems to be seeking clarification about a previous event, which is a common function of non-sarcastic questions.
5. without broader context that might reveal irony or contradictory information, it's safer to interpret this as a genuine inquiry.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be subtle and highly context-dependent. if there's additional context that contradicts this interpretation, the label could potentially change.",0.0

the statement by sheldon exhibits classic signs of sarcasm. he's making a pointed comment about the difficulty of interacting with someone experiencing menstrual symptoms, but doing so in an exaggerated and somewhat insensitive manner. the use of specific, uncomfortable descriptors (""bloated, cranky and crampy"") in the context of what is likely a social interaction suggests a sarcastic tone. this fits with the cue about emotional contrast between a normal state and an irritable one, with the sarcasm lying in the blunt, overstated way sheldon describes the situation.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. hyperbole: the use of ""half a dozen menorahs"" is likely an exaggeration for comedic effect.
2. subtle contrast: while not explicitly stated, there's an implied contrast between the expectation of a single menorah and the exaggerated use of many.
3. casual tone: the use of ""yeah"" and the colloquial phrase ""turns out"" suggest a casual, potentially sardonic delivery.
4. understated humor: the phrase ""really sets a mood"" is likely meant ironically, implying that the excessive number of menorahs creates an unintended or overly dramatic atmosphere.

while the sarcasm is subtle, the combination of exaggeration, casual tone, and the implication that this observation is somehow surprising or noteworthy (""turns out"") points towards a sarcastic intent rather than a straightforward statement.",1.0

the text displays clear markers of sarcasm, including a mocking tone, exaggerated comparison, and a hypothetical scenario used to belittle leonard's idea. the final ""burn"" comment further emphasizes the sarcastic intent. this dialogue is characteristic of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory,"" known for his condescending and sarcastic remarks towards his friends.",1.0

sarcastic

this label is appropriate because:

1. the text uses humor to downplay a significant religious event (the israelites wandering in the desert for 40 years).
2. there's a clear contrast between the gravity of the biblical reference and the casual, colloquial phrase ""walk it off,"" which is typically used for minor injuries or setbacks.
3. the speaker is employing irony by suggesting that a profound historical and spiritual journey was simply about physical exercise or recovery.
4. the brevity and informal tone of the statement contribute to its sarcastic nature, making light of a serious topic.

the combination of these elements creates a clear sarcastic tone, using humor and irony to comment on a well-known religious narrative in an unexpectedly casual way.",1.0

sarcastic

reasoning:

3. the informal tone and concise phrasing suggest a casual, potentially humorous context where sarcasm would be more likely to occur.
4. while there are no clear emotional words or contrasts, sarcasm often relies on the incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning, which is present here.

the statement appears to be making a joke about amy's role or appearance, implying she's in charge of looking old or acting old, which is not a literal responsibility one would typically assign. this kind of humor aligns well with sarcastic speech.",1.0

this dialogue appears to be using humor and exaggeration through a pop culture reference to star wars, creating a sarcastic tone as leonard jokingly claims he'll sense someone's arrival like a jedi. the casual, humorous style and use of allusion suggest this is meant to be taken as a sarcastic quip rather than a literal statement.",1.0

1. the statement expresses genuine surprise (""wow"") about an unusual fact.
2. there's no evident contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typical in sarcasm.
3. the tone is casual and informative, consistent with sharing an interesting piece of information.
4. the context (mentioning denny's and las vegas) suggests this is likely a straightforward comment about an unusual wedding venue.
5. there are no indicators of irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm.

the speaker (penny) appears to be genuinely surprised or amused by the fact that there's a denny's restaurant in las vegas where people can get married, which is an unusual but true concept. this statement seems to be expressing sincere amazement rather than any sarcastic intent.",0.0

 PHOEBE: Oh some guy she met in the movies
 ROSS: Oh really? What does he want with her?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input and cues provided, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

the quote appears to be a playful, euphemistic reference to romantic/sexual activities using casual language typical of sitcom dialogue. while it employs innuendo and wordplay, it does not seem to convey sarcasm or irony. the tone is more lighthearted and suggestive rather than sarcastic.",0.0
CHANDLER: You have to stop the Q-Tip when there is resistance,"JOEY: My family's been going to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait 16. Excuse me, 15 ...  Alright when was 1990?
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this line is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. context: it's spoken by chandler, a character from the tv show ""friends"" known for his sarcastic humor.

2. unexpected advice: using a q-tip for ear cleaning is common knowledge, but chandler is stating it as if it's profound wisdom.

3. tone: the phrasing ""you have to stop..."" implies a mock-serious tone, as if he's sharing an important life lesson.

4. implication: the line subtly suggests that the person he's speaking to doesn't know when to stop, which is a form of sarcastic criticism.

5. comedic timing: in the context of a sitcom, this kind of statement is typically delivered with sarcastic intent for comedic effect.

the combination of these factors strongly suggests that this line is meant to be interpreted as sarcastic rather than a genuine piece of advice.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Joey if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys","PERSON: When their pets pass on, they want them sort of laid out like they are sleeping. But, occassionally theres a person who wants them in a pose like chasing their tail or uh, jumping to catch a frizbee.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the provided cues and context. the statement from chandler exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it uses dark humor to address a serious topic (death) in a surprisingly casual way.
2. there's an incongruity between the gravity of discussing one's death and the trivial act of looking for keys.
3. it's typical of chandler's character (from the tv show ""friends"") to use sarcasm and humor as a defense mechanism when dealing with uncomfortable topics.

the lack of punctuation at the end and the informal structure further support the casual, off-handed delivery often associated with sarcastic remarks. the statement is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous, sarcastic comment on mortality and everyday frustrations.",1.0

 JOEY: That's how they do pants. First they go up they move it over, then they go up the other side and move it back, then they do the rear. What? Ross will you tell them? Isn't that how a tailor measures ?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the enthusiastic agreement ""yes yes it is!"" contrasts sharply with the unexpected mention of ""in prison!!"" this sudden shift creates a jarring juxtaposition that is often characteristic of sarcasm.

2. the use of multiple exclamation points and repetition (""yes yes"") suggests an exaggerated tone, which is common in sarcastic statements.

3. the capitalization of ""ross"" and the informal, emphatic style suggest this might be dialogue from a sitcom or similar context where sarcasm is often employed for comedic effect.

4. the mention of prison as an apparently positive or exciting thing (based on the enthusiastic tone) is likely meant to be ironic, as prison is generally not considered a desirable place to be.

5. while the text is brief, the contrast between the initial enthusiasm and the mention of prison creates the kind of unexpected twist that is often found in sarcastic remarks.

given these factors, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to create humor or make a point, rather than being a sincere expression of enthusiasm about prison.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Uh, so how many cameras are actually on you.","PERSON1: Where's Monica?
 MONICA: Over here Dad
 PERSON2: How to you zoom out? There she is
 JOEY: Some girl ate Monica
 MONICA: Shut up, the camera adds 10 pounds.
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

the input text appears to be a straightforward question from a character named chandler, asking about the number of cameras focused on someone. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief line of dialogue. the use of ""uh"" at the beginning suggests hesitation or uncertainty, which is common in natural speech, but doesn't imply sarcasm. the question itself is direct and seems to be seeking genuine information. without additional context or tone indicators, this statement should be interpreted as a non-sarcastic, sincere question.",0.0
CHANDLER: But younger than some buildings!,"CHANDLER: I know Richard's really nice and everything, it's just that we don't know him really well you know, plus he is old  ...  er than some people.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the input text ""chandler: but younger than some buildings!"" exhibits several characteristics that strongly suggest it is sarcastic:

1. hyperbole: the comparison of a person's age to buildings is an exaggerated statement, which is a common feature of sarcasm.

2. defensive tone: the use of ""but"" at the beginning suggests this is a response to a comment about age, likely using humor to deflect.

3. exclamation mark: the use of an exclamation point adds emphasis, often used in sarcastic statements for dramatic effect.

4. context of the character: chandler, presumably from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor.

5. unexpected comparison: comparing human age to the age of buildings is an unexpected and humorous juxtaposition, typical of sarcastic comments.

6. implied self-deprecation: while seemingly defending his age, the statement actually draws attention to it in a humorous way, which is a common sarcastic technique.

given these factors, particularly the hyperbole and the character's known tendency for sarcasm, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this statement.",1.0
"CHANDLER: And then and then you clicked it again, she's dressed. She is a business woman, she is walking down the street and oh oh oh she's naked.","RACHEL: Did you have fun at the bachelor's party last night?

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward, excited description of a changing image or video, likely in a humorous context. the speaker (chandler) is describing a sequence of events with enthusiasm and surprise, but there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the language is direct and expressive, conveying genuine excitement or shock at the unexpected changes in the image/video being described. the contrast between the businesswoman image and sudden nudity is presented as surprising but not necessarily sarcastic. therefore, based on the content and style of delivery, this text is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

the input text is clearly sarcastic. chandler's exaggerated self-deprecation and over-the-top dramatic language are typical of his character's sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends."" the hyperbole identified in the rhetorical analysis and the extreme negative emotions expressed are used for comedic effect, not as a genuine expression of hopelessness or awkwardness. this kind of exaggerated, self-mocking statement is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially in the context of chandler's character.",1.0

this line appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the context suggests it's from a sitcom script (likely ""friends,"" given the character name chandler).
2. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the show.
3. the statement humorously and unexpectedly connects a serious situation (implied by ""either that"") to gloria estefan's upbeat song lyrics.
4. the abrupt shift from what seems to be a serious topic to a pop culture reference is a common sarcastic technique.

the lack of punctuation and casual structure further support the informal, joking tone typical of sarcasm in dialogue.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

i believe this label is accurate based on the analysis of the language style and the context provided. chandler's statement has a clear sarcastic undertone, which is typical of his character in the tv show ""friends"". the line ""i'd miss you if i broke up with you"" followed by ""just trying to be supportive"" is a classic example of chandler's dry, sarcastic humor. he's not genuinely suggesting a breakup, but rather making a joke to lighten the mood or respond to something said previously. this kind of statement is precisely the type of dialogue that would be labeled as sarcastic in the context of analyzing dialogue or script writing.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Oh, uh, no thanks. I just had an M&M.","PERSON: Hey, you guys the water is great. You should really go in!
",FRIENDS,1,"label: sarcastic

this line is clearly sarcastic. chandler's response of ""i just had an m&m"" to decline food is an obvious understatement and exaggeration. a single m&m candy is far from sufficient to satisfy hunger, so chandler is using this absurd claim to humorously deflect the offer of food. this kind of dry, understated humor is characteristic of chandler's sarcastic wit in the show ""friends.""",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement is direct and straightforward, expressing a negative assessment of someone's abilities.
2. there's no clear indication of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would typically signal sarcasm.
3. the informal and blunt nature of the statement suggests it's likely meant to be taken at face value.
4. without additional context that might reveal a contradictory intent, it's safer to interpret this as a sincere, albeit harsh, statement.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input text ""monica: really?"", i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic without more context. the word ""really?"" can be used both sincerely (expressing genuine surprise or seeking confirmation) or sarcastically (expressing disbelief or skepticism).

however, if i must choose a label based solely on this brief input, i would lean towards:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: without additional context or cues (such as tone of voice, facial expressions, or preceding conversation), it's generally safer to assume a straightforward, non-sarcastic interpretation. the question ""really?"" on its own is often used to express genuine surprise or to seek confirmation, rather than to convey sarcasm. however, this classification has low confidence due to the lack of context.",0.0
"CHANDLER: Our balcony? Seriously?

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the use of rhetorical questions (""seriously?"") and exaggerated enthusiasm (""that's so funny"") suggest a mocking tone.

2. the contrast between chandler's apparent excitement and monica's practical objection creates irony.

3. the repetition of ""no no"" in monica's reported speech emphasizes her disagreement, which chandler seems to be mocking.

4. chandler's final statement about putting lights out to encourage people to use a cold balcony is likely meant to be taken as absurd or illogical, further indicating sarcasm.

5. the overall casual and conversational tone, combined with the emotional contrasts described in the cues, supports a sarcastic interpretation of chandler's words.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this text.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the context provided, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
while chandler's statement is exaggerated for dramatic effect (using hyperbole), it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the use of ""oh my god"" and the hyperbolic phrase ""you almost gave me a heart attack"" are genuine expressions of surprise or shock, rather than ironic or mocking statements meant to convey the opposite of what's being said. chandler is likely expressing sincere alarm or startlement, even if in an exaggerated manner typical of his character's speech patterns.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of hyperbole in chandler's statement, particularly the exaggerated claim that ""it was someone else's subconscious,"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this absurd explanation for his actions is typical of chandler's character and his tendency to use humor, especially sarcasm, in awkward or apologetic situations. the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to humorously deflect responsibility while acknowledging the absurdity of the excuse.",1.0

CHANDLER: Crazy bitch!,"JOEY: Well the tough thing is she really wants to have sex with me.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and context, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the exclamation mark (!) indicates strong emotion or emphasis.
2. the use of highly charged, negative words ""crazy"" and ""bitch"" is extreme.
3. in the context of the sitcom ""friends"" (as implied by the character name chandler), such an outburst is likely to be exaggerated for comedic effect rather than a genuine insult.
4. chandler's character is known for his sarcastic humor and quips.

therefore, this line is most likely intended to be sarcastic, possibly mocking or exaggerating a reaction to someone's behavior rather than a sincere insult.",1.0

 PERSON: There is a little child inside this man.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the use of hyperbole: the statement that removing something would cause death is likely an exaggeration for dramatic or comedic effect, which is a common element in sarcastic speech.

2. the context of the character: chandler is a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"".

3. the exclamation point: while it could indicate genuine alarm, in the context of chandler's character, it's more likely to be emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

4. the absurdity of the situation: it's unlikely that doctors would suggest removing something if it would definitely cause death, which suggests this is not meant to be taken literally.

5. the informal, conversational tone: this fits with chandler's typical way of speaking and often accompanies his sarcastic remarks.

while the text doesn't contain clear emotional contrasts, the combination of these factors, especially the hyperbole and the character's known tendencies, strongly suggest that this statement is meant to be sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the context of the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement comes from chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends.""
2. winning a million dollars is an extremely unlikely and dramatic event, which makes it a prime subject for sarcasm.
3. the exclamation point and enthusiastic tone seem exaggerated, which is often a marker of sarcasm.
4. in the context of a sitcom dialogue, such an outlandish claim is more likely to be a sarcastic joke than a genuine statement.
5. without additional context, chandler suddenly announcing he won a million dollars in casual conversation seems improbable, suggesting it's meant to be taken ironically.

therefore, considering chandler's character traits and the nature of the statement, it's highly likely that this is a sarcastic remark rather than a genuine announcement of winning money.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
while the statement has a humorous tone typical of sitcom dialogue, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. chandler is expressing a genuine, if exaggerated, concern about party attendance. the hyperbole used (""there will be nobody left"") is more for comedic effect rather than to convey the opposite of what is meant, which is a key characteristic of sarcasm. the statement seems to be a straightforward, albeit dramatized, worry about the spelling game's potential popularity.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. context: the line is attributed to chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends.""

2. sudden realization: the phrase ""oh, wait a minute"" indicates a sudden thought, which is often used in sarcastic statements for comedic effect.

3. exaggeration: saying ""i have no one"" is likely an exaggeration, as it's improbable that chandler literally has no one in his life. this hyperbole is a common element of sarcasm.

4. tone: the informal, conversational tone and the way the statement is structured suggest a dry, self-deprecating humor typical of sarcasm.

5. contrast: there's an implied contrast between an initial thought (possibly that he has someone) and the stated realization, which is a common structure in sarcastic comments.

while the statement could be taken literally in isolation, knowing it's from chandler and considering the typical use of such phrases in comedic contexts, it's highly likely this is meant to be a sarcastic, self-deprecating joke rather than a sincere expression of loneliness.",1.0

rationale:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward statement about chandler's smoking habit.
2. there's no evident irony or mocking tone in the statement.

sarcastic

explanation:
this statement is clearly sarcastic. it references the famous 1970s anti-littering public service announcement featuring a native american actor (often referred to as the ""crying indian""), and humorously suggests that littering might summon this character to help in some way. the absurdity of intentionally littering to get help, combined with the reference to a well-known psa character, creates a clear sarcastic tone. this is typical of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic humor.",1.0

explanation:
the statement ""nope, that patch is no good"" is a straightforward, matter-of-fact assertion. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the informal language style and use of ""nope"" suggest casual speech, but not sarcasm. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this appears to be a sincere evaluation of a patch (likely referring to a clothing patch or software patch) as being unsuitable or ineffective.",0.0

label: sarcastic

the reason for this classification is:

1. the statement is clearly not meant to be taken literally. chandler is not genuinely suggesting that whatever he's referring to would actually keep kids in school.

2. the question is rhetorical, which is a common device used in sarcasm.

3. the presence of the question mark at the end, as noted in the cues, supports the sarcastic tone.

4. knowing that this is a quote from chandler in the tv show ""friends,"" it's consistent with his character's frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.

5. the exaggerated implication that something (likely trivial or irrelevant) would be so compelling as to keep all kids in school is a classic sarcastic technique of overstatement.

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a simple, matter-of-fact observation.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the informal, conversational tone is typical for regular dialogue rather than sarcastic commentary.
4. without additional context or cues indicating a sarcastic intent, it's safer to interpret this as a straightforward comment.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and with only this single line, we can't be absolutely certain. if there were more context from the conversation or scene, it might potentially reveal a sarcastic intent that isn't apparent from this isolated statement.",0.0

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the context suggests this is likely a line from a tv show or sitcom, particularly given the character name ""chandler"" (possibly from the show ""friends"").
2. the question itself combines a serious topic (burying someone) with a casual, almost flippant tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.
3. the cues mention that the text suggests a ""potentially humorous or sarcastic tone, depending on full context.""
4. chandler, as a character (if this is indeed from ""friends""), is known for his sarcastic humor.
5. the question itself is absurd - it's unlikely someone would actually be late because they were burying a woman, which points to the use of sarcasm to exaggerate or make light of the situation.

while we don't have full context, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that this line is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine inquiry.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the label for this input is likely ""sarcastic"" for the following reasons:

1. context: chandler is a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends.""

2. irony: wearing a t-shirt that says ""i don't belong here"" is inherently ironic, as the act of wearing it in public contradicts the message.

3. self-deprecating humor: this type of statement is typical of chandler's character, using self-deprecating humor to express discomfort or awkwardness in a situation.

4. contrast between medium and message: the casual nature of a t-shirt combined with an existential message creates a humorous juxtaposition.

5. indirect communication: using clothing to communicate a message is often a form of indirect or passive-aggressive communication, which can be a vehicle for sarcasm.

given these factors, especially considering chandler's character and the nature of the statement, this input is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text contains typical markers of sarcasm:
   - the use of ""ha ha!"" followed by criticism indicates mock laughter
   - the exaggerated statement ""you the worst best man ever!"" is likely not meant literally
2. the ellipsis (...) suggests a pause for dramatic effect, often used in sarcastic delivery
3. the exclamation marks emphasize the dramatic, potentially insincere tone
4. the context of chandler (likely referring to the character from friends) who is known for his sarcastic humor
5. the contrast between the initial request for time to wake up and the sudden enthusiastic mockery supports a sarcastic interpretation

these elements together strongly indicate that the speaker is not being sincere, but rather using sarcasm to tease or mock the person who lost the ring.",1.0

while the question itself is unusual and potentially humorous, chandler's statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. he seems to be genuinely asking phoebe a strange question, acknowledging her tendency to know unusual facts. the tone is more curious and teasing rather than sarcastic. the phrase ""you know strange things"" is a direct acknowledgment of phoebe's character trait, not an ironic or sarcastic comment. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""and the bunny got away!"" appears to be a straightforward exclamation without any indicators of sarcasm. the cues suggest that this is likely part of a casual narrative or dialogue, possibly from a script. the exclamatory tone and simple structure indicate genuine emotion (possibly surprise or disappointment) rather than sarcasm. without additional context that might contradict the literal meaning, it's most reasonable to interpret this statement as sincere and not sarcastic.",0.0

not sarcastic

this appears to be a straightforward line of dialogue without clear indicators of sarcasm. the tone seems direct and informal, as would be expected in casual conversation. without additional context, there's no evidence of irony or mocking that would suggest sarcasm. the speaker (chandler) seems to be making a sincere statement about someone making things disappear, whether metaphorically or literally.",0.0
"CHANDLER: Wow you look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani","PERSON: [Laughs]
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the cues provided, particularly the identified situational irony and potential humor in the statement, as well as the context that this is likely a line from a script (possibly from the tv show ""friends"" given the character name chandler), i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reason for this label is:
1. the inversion of the typical parent-child resemblance observation creates an unexpected and humorous situation.
2. the use of ""wow"" at the beginning suggests an exaggerated or overstated reaction, which is often a marker of sarcasm.
3. the character chandler from ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic humor, which adds to the likelihood that this statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.

while the statement could be interpreted as a genuine observation in some contexts, the combination of these factors, especially within the context of a sitcom dialogue, strongly suggests a sarcastic intent.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the available cues and the brief input text, i don't have enough context to confidently determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the question ""your makeup?"" on its own doesn't inherently indicate sarcasm. it could be a genuine inquiry or potentially sarcastic depending on the tone, context, and relationship between the speakers. without more information about the situation, characters, or surrounding dialogue, it's not possible to reliably assign a sarcastic or not sarcastic label to this isolated line.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the input text displays clear signs of sarcasm, primarily through the use of unexpected humor and contrasting tones. here's why:

1. the statement begins with a serious, sympathetic tone (""i'm sorry man"") but then abruptly shifts to an absurd suggestion (""stop catching on fire"").

2. the unexpectedness of the advice ""stop catching on fire"" is a classic example of situational humor often used in sitcoms to generate laughs.

3. the contrast between the initial sympathetic tone and the ridiculous suggestion creates a comedic effect typical of sarcastic statements.

4. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the show ""friends,"" which adds context to interpreting this line as sarcastic.

5. the use of ""there is never a good time to have to..."" sets up an expectation for serious advice, which is then subverted for comedic effect.

given these factors, the statement is clearly intended to be humorous and not literal, fitting the definition of sarcasm as the use of irony to mock or convey contempt. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic"".",1.0

sarcastic

the statement by chandler is clearly sarcastic. it employs irony by suggesting an absurd and completely unrelated medical procedure (laser eye surgery) to treat a hernia. this deliberate mismatch between the medical condition and the proposed treatment creates a humorous effect, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to highlight the absurdity of the situation or perhaps joey's reluctance to seek proper medical treatment for his hernia.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the text appears to be dialogue from chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends.""

2. the content involves an inappropriate joke followed by an apology, which is characteristic of chandler's tendency to make sarcastic or inappropriate comments and then immediately recognize their impropriety.

3. the phrase ""that's the kind of thing i do"" suggests self-awareness about a habitual behavior, which in chandler's case is often making sarcastic or ill-timed jokes.

4. the contrast between the crude joke and the immediate apology creates a typical sarcastic tone, where the speaker is aware of the social impropriety but cannot help themselves.

while the statement itself may not be classically sarcastic (saying the opposite of what is meant), the overall context and delivery strongly suggest a sarcastic character and tone, making ""sarcastic"" the most appropriate label for this text.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the rhetorical device identified in the cues explicitly mentions that this statement is likely meant sarcastically.

2. the use of exaggerated praise (""quite the craftsman!"") in combination with the exclamation mark can often indicate sarcasm, especially in the context of sitcom-style dialogue (given the names chandler and joe, which are likely references to the tv show ""friends"").

3. the informal, casual tone and the use of first names suggest a familiar relationship where sarcasm might be more commonly used.

4. the typo ""jon"" instead of ""job"" could be intentional to further emphasize the sarcastic tone, implying that joe's work is so poor that even the praise for it is carelessly delivered.

while the statement appears positive on the surface, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that chandler is being sarcastic about joe's craftsmanship, likely in response to a poorly done job.",1.0

the reasons for this judgment are:

sarcastic

this statement by chandler is clearly sarcastic. it's a witty, indirect way of pointing out that someone lacks a mental filter or self-control when speaking. the sarcasm comes from the implication that there should be ""something"" in one's head to control speech, when in reality, this ability (thinking before speaking) is expected to be present in most people. chandler's comment humorously highlights its apparent absence in the person he's addressing.",1.0

 ROSS: I went to their tanning place your wife suggested.
",FRIENDS,1,"given the context provided and the nature of the quote, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

### label: sarcastic

this line is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. hyperbole: as noted in the cues, the question uses hyperbole by comparing a place to the sun. this exaggeration is a common sarcastic technique.

2. character context: chandler, presumably from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor.

3. implied criticism: the question indirectly criticizes a place for being excessively bright or hot, using sarcasm to make the point.

4. rhetorical question: it's not meant to be answered literally, but rather to express chandler's discomfort or annoyance with the place in question.

the combination of these factors, especially the use of hyperbole and the character's known tendency for sarcasm, strongly indicates that this line is meant to be sarcastic rather than a genuine inquiry.",1.0

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. here's why:

1. context: this line is from the character chandler in the tv show ""friends."" chandler is known for his sarcastic humor.

2. tone: the exaggerated enthusiasm for doing laundry all night is unlikely to be genuine. most people wouldn't be excited about doing laundry, especially not all night.

3. repetition and emphasis: the phrase ""all night laundry"" is repeated and emphasized with an exclamation mark, which amplifies the sarcastic tone.

4. contrast: the use of ""great!"" at the beginning sets up a positive expectation, which is then contrasted with the mundane activity of doing laundry, highlighting the sarcasm.

5. exaggeration: the idea of doing laundry ""all night"" is an exaggeration that further indicates sarcasm.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that chandler is being sarcastic about the prospect of doing laundry all night, rather than genuinely expressing excitement.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. the context and tone strongly indicate that chandler is making a dark, sardonic joke:

1. the combination of a seemingly positive start (""that's a good one"") with an extremely morbid scenario (people plummeting to their deaths) is a classic sarcastic juxtaposition.

2. the absurdity of the scenario - finding people whose new year's resolution is to die in a plane crash - is so extreme that it can only be interpreted as sarcasm.

3. this type of dark, ironic humor is very characteristic of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" which is further confirmed by the mention of ""pheebs"" (phoebe, another character from the show).

4. the casual way in which chandler talks about such a tragic event (""all that i have to do"") in contrast to the severity of the subject matter (multiple deaths) is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

therefore, the correct label for this input is definitely ""sarcastic.""",1.0
"CHANDLER: You know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.","CHANDLER: What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.

i believe this label is reliable based on the provided cues and my analysis of the input text. here's why:

1. contrast: the statement sets up a contrast between how ""some might find it amusing"" and how chandler finds it ""regular."" this contrast is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

2. understatement: chandler's use of ""regular"" to describe his reaction is likely an understatement, which is a common sarcastic technique. by saying he finds it ""regular"" when others might find it ""amusing,"" he's likely implying that he actually finds it quite unamusing or even annoying.

3. character context: chandler, as a character (presumably from the tv show ""friends""), is known for his sarcastic humor. this statement aligns with his typical manner of speech.

4. punctuation: the comma in the sentence creates a pause that enhances the delivery of the sarcastic punchline.

5. emotional contrast: the cues point out the contrast between ""amusing"" and ""regular,"" which supports the sarcastic interpretation.

given these factors, the statement is most likely meant to be interpreted sarcastically, with chandler actually expressing his dislike or disapproval of whatever is being discussed in a characteristically dry, sarcastic manner.",1.0

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the text is clearly a sarcastic comment made by the character chandler, likely from the tv show ""friends."" he's making a joke about someone's unusual name (hornswoggle) by sarcastically comparing it to characters from the children's show ""fraggle rock."" this type of witty, mocking humor is characteristic of sarcasm, especially coming from a character known for his sarcastic quips.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement combines an initial seemingly serious explanation with an absurd, exaggerated scenario that creates a humorous contrast. this sudden shift from a defensive tone to an outlandish example is a classic hallmark of sarcasm, used here to deflect from the initial implication of guilt or embarrassment. the specific mention of a telescope and donuts adds an element of absurdity that enhances the sarcastic effect.",1.0

the text appears to be a straightforward, albeit casual and simplified, statement about historical facts regarding the jamestown colony. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the speaker seems to be genuinely attempting to explain something, albeit in an informal and incomplete manner. the use of ""you see"" and the trailing off with ""so"" suggest a conversational tone rather than a sarcastic one.",0.0

"CHANDLER: Oh yeah ok, including the waffles last week, you now owe me, seventeen zillion dollars.","JOEY: Hey, Chan. Can you help me out here, I promise I'll pay you back.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe the correct label for this dialogue is ""sarcastic."" here's why:

1. hyperbole: the use of ""seventeen zillion dollars"" is an extreme exaggeration, which is a common feature of sarcasm.

2. tone: the overall tone is described as playful and exaggerated, which aligns with sarcastic speech.

3. context: the dialogue appears to be from a sitcom or similar entertainment context, where sarcasm is often used for comedic effect.

4. language style: the informal, conversational tone with humorous exaggeration is typical of sarcastic remarks.

5. structure: the way chandler builds up to the exaggerated amount, starting with ""oh yeah ok,"" and mentioning ""the waffles last week,"" sets up a sarcastic punchline.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that chandler is not being literal, but is using sarcasm to humorously exaggerate the debt owed to him. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this text.",1.0
"CHANDLER: No, no, I am just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.","CHANDLER: Anybody know a good tailor?

CHANDLER: Spanish midgets wrestling Julie! Okay yes I see how they got there.,"ROSS: Man, I sure miss Julie
",FRIENDS,1,"given the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. the exclamatory nature of the first sentence, followed by a more deadpan agreement, creates a contrast that's often used in sarcastic remarks.

2. the content itself is absurd (spanish midgets wrestling julie), which is frequently used in sarcastic statements to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation.

3. the phrase ""okay yes i see how they got there"" is a classic sarcastic formulation, implying that the speaker doesn't actually see how they got there, but is pretending to understand an absurd leap of logic.

4. the overall tone, as noted in the cues, is described as ""humorous and somewhat sarcastic or bemused.""

5. the character chandler, from the tv show friends, is known for his sarcastic humor, which adds context to interpreting this line as sarcastic.

these elements combined strongly suggest that this statement is meant to be understood as sarcastic rather than literal.",1.0

 JOEY: You have any idea what this will do to your sex life?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward statement from chandler about adapting to a change (likely weight gain). while there's a subtle humor in his self-deprecating acknowledgment of gaining weight, the overall tone is matter-of-fact and lacks the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. the use of the metaphor ""get back on track"" is common in everyday speech and doesn't indicate sarcasm in this context. the language is casual and informative, consistent with chandler's character in providing a realistic assessment of his situation without employing sarcasm.",0.0
"CHANDLER: A lonely grey couch. "" O look "" cried Ned. And then the kingdom was his. The End.","CHANDLER: It was summer. And it was hot. Rachel was there.
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics that suggest sarcasm:

1. abrupt tonal shift: it begins with a mundane, somewhat melancholic description (""a lonely grey couch"") and suddenly transitions to a fairy tale-like ending (""and then the kingdom was his. the end.""). this stark contrast is often used in sarcastic humor.

2. oversimplification: the extremely condensed narrative arc from a lonely couch to gaining a kingdom is absurdly simplified, which is a common sarcastic technique to mock overly simplistic stories or explanations.

3. incongruity: the connection between seeing a couch and suddenly gaining a kingdom is nonsensical, highlighting the absurdity often found in sarcastic statements.

4. mock dramatic language: the use of ""o look"" with the capitalized ""o"" seems to be mocking overly dramatic or archaic speech patterns.

5. abrupt ending: the sudden ""the end"" after such a brief and bizarre sequence of events adds to the sarcastic tone, as if mocking the idea of a satisfying conclusion.

given these elements, the text appears to be using sarcasm to poke fun at simplistic storytelling or perhaps the idea of sudden, unearned success. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this input.",1.0
CHANDLER: See Joe that's why your parents told you not to jump on your bed!,"JOEY: Whoa!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this label is appropriate because:

1. the statement is clearly a sarcastic remark made by chandler, likely in response to joe getting hurt or experiencing a negative consequence.

2. the tone is teasing and humorous, using a common childhood experience (being told not to jump on the bed) to point out the irony of the current situation.

3. the exclamation point at the end emphasizes the sarcastic delivery.

4. the cues specifically mention that this is likely a sarcastic or humorous remark, rather than a sincere statement.

5. the use of ""see joe"" at the beginning sets up the sarcastic tone, implying a ""i told you so"" or ""you should have known better"" sentiment.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" accurately describes the nature of this dialogue.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the build-up of ""i just have to do one thing, really quickly, its not a big thing"" contrasts sharply with the sudden, forceful ""get up"" at the end. this unexpected twist is a common sarcastic technique.

2. the use of minimizing language (""just"", ""really quickly"", ""not a big thing"") followed by an apparently urgent command creates ironic contrast.

3. the ellipsis (...) before ""get up"" suggests a pause for dramatic effect, often used in sarcastic delivery.

4. the all-caps ""get up"" implies a change in tone that contradicts the casual setup, which is characteristic of sarcastic humor.

5. the character chandler, if this is from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic wit, adding context to this interpretation.

this combination of casual setup, ironic contrast, and sudden tonal shift strongly suggests that this line is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward observation or speculation about someone's behavior.
2. there's no obvious contrast or emotional juxtaposition that would indicate sarcasm.
3. the language is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or exaggeration.
4. the context seems to be part of a larger conversation or narrative, likely from a script, where chandler is making a sincere comment about damone's behavior.
5. there are no clear rhetorical devices or emotional words that might suggest a sarcastic tone.

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the context suggests a sitcom-like dialogue, where chandler (a character known for sarcasm in the tv show ""friends"") is speaking.

2. the phrase ""maybe it's a contest"" followed by ""you know?"" indicates a mocking or ironic tone.

3. the use of ""like 'collect all five'"" is a clear reference to marketing slogans often used for collectible items or promotions. using this phrase in an unrelated context implies sarcasm.

4. the overall structure of the sentence, combining speculation with a pop culture reference, is typical of sarcastic humor.

the punctuation cues, particularly the use of quotation marks, support this interpretation by highlighting the ""collect all five"" phrase as a mimicry of promotional language, which is being used sarcastically in this context.",1.0

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. wordplay/pun: chandler's use of ""predicament room"" instead of ""emergency room"" is a classic example of sarcastic humor.

2. the informal, conversational tone and the structure of the sentence are typical of sitcom dialogue, particularly for a character known for sarcasm.

3. the conditional phrasing ""i guess you would know"" often precedes sarcastic statements.

4. while there aren't explicit emotional words, the overall tone and delivery imply sarcasm, which is characteristic of chandler's character (assuming this is from the tv show ""friends"").

5. the lack of punctuation at the end of the sentence, while technically incorrect, is common in transcriptions of casual, sarcastic speech.

this combination of factors strongly indicates that the statement is meant to be sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

sarcastic

this response from chandler is a classic example of his character's sarcastic wit. the use of psychological terms in an ironic manner, along with the implication that being ""perfect"" is less desirable than being ""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive,"" clearly indicates a sarcastic tone. this is very typical of chandler's character in the show ""friends,"" known for his self-deprecating humor and sarcastic quips.",1.0

the text exhibits several characteristics that point towards sarcasm:

1. unexpected word play: the phrase ""got a ross on its ass"" is a clever pun, substituting ""ross"" for ""cross"" in the common idiom ""got a cross to bear."" this type of wordplay is often used in sarcastic or humorous contexts.

2. exaggeration: the idea of a monkey literally having a person (ross) on its behind is an absurd exaggeration, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. tone and context: the exclamation point and the informal, conversational style suggest an exaggerated, dramatic delivery typical of sarcastic comments.

4. character context: knowing this is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" chandler's character is known for his sarcastic humor, making this line consistent with his typical mode of expression.

5. situational irony: the statement creates a humorous contrast between the serious-sounding idiom and the absurd image it evokes, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

explanation:
the statement by chandler appears to be straightforward and honest, without any indicators of sarcasm. the cues highlight the informal, direct, and honest tone of the speech. there's no evidence of emotional contrast, exaggeration, or irony that would typically be associated with sarcastic statements. chandler is simply expressing his unwillingness to lie if asked about something, which is a direct and sincere communication.",0.0

2. chandler is a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"".
3. the exclamation mark adds emphasis that seems exaggerated for a genuine expression of indifference.
4. the use of filler words and interjections before a short, decisive statement creates a comedic timing often associated with sarcasm.

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

the statement from chandler exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it implies the opposite of what is literally said: chandler doesn't actually believe someone would ""really really like"" their couch to such an extreme degree.

2. there's an element of mock surprise or feigned misunderstanding: ""oh i see"" suggests chandler is pretending to have just realized something obvious.

3. the exaggeration: using ""really"" twice emphasizes the absurdity of the supposed misunderstanding.

4. context: given this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" he's known for his sarcastic quips.

the cues also support this interpretation, noting the mildly sarcastic or humorous tone and the use of ""liked"" in a context suggesting chandler was mistaken about the situation. this aligns perfectly with the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the use of understatement as a rhetorical device, downplaying something by comparing it to a minor oddity (having a third nipple).
2. the contrast between initially minimizing the issue (""not big, not at all"") and then comparing it to something unusual, which creates a humorous effect typical of sarcasm.
3. the exclamation mark at the end, emphasizing the absurdity of the comparison.
4. the hesitation (""i don't know"") before delivering the punchline, which is often a setup for sarcastic remarks.
5. the overall tone and structure of the statement, which appears to be making light of a situation through exaggerated understatement.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is a brief dialogue snippet, likely from a script.
2. while the character chandler uses a rhetorical question ""my duties?"", this appears to be seeking clarification rather than expressing sarcasm.
3. the response ""all right"" suggests acceptance or agreement, which doesn't indicate a sarcastic tone.
4. there's no clear contrast between the words and their intended meaning, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
5. the brevity and straightforward nature of the response doesn't provide enough context to suggest a sarcastic intent.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available information and the brief input text ""rachel: oh."", i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the word ""oh"" by itself, without additional context or tone indicators, can be used in various ways - it could express genuine surprise, realization, disappointment, or even be used sarcastically. 

however, given that we are asked to choose between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', and considering that sarcasm typically requires more context or a more elaborate statement to be clear, i would lean towards labeling this as:

not sarcastic

this label is chosen because:
1. ""oh"" is a common, neutral interjection that doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm.
2. sarcasm usually requires more context or a more complex statement to be evident.
3. without any additional cues or context, it's safer to assume a straightforward, non-sarcastic interpretation.

however, i want to emphasize that this classification is made with low confidence due to the minimal context provided.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a simple, straightforward line of dialogue from a character named chandler.
2. there's no obvious irony, exaggeration, or contrast between literal and intended meaning that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the exclamation and question seem genuine rather than mocking or insincere.
4. the informal, conversational tone is consistent with regular speech rather than sarcastic delivery.
5. without more context, the statement ""the whole thing!"" and question ""can we go?"" appear to be sincere expressions of excitement or urgency rather than sarcastic comments.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle and context-dependent, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief snippet of dialogue. therefore, the most appropriate label based on the available information is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

without more information about the situation or the tone of the conversation, it's not possible to make a definitive judgment. chandler, as a character (presumably from the tv show ""friends""), is known for his sarcastic humor, but this single line alone doesn't provide enough evidence to classify it as sarcastic.

1. the use of a rhetorical question is a strong indicator of sarcasm in this context.
2. the tone of the question implies frustration or exasperation, which is often conveyed through sarcasm.
3. the phrasing ""does this look like a garbage can to you?"" suggests that phoebe is likely pointing out something obvious in a mocking or sarcastic manner.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and the current cues, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the exclamation ""really!?"" is a common expression of genuine surprise or disbelief.
2. without further context, this short statement doesn't provide enough information to confidently identify sarcasm.
3. the use of both an exclamation mark and a question mark (really!?) emphasizes the speaker's emotional reaction, which is more likely to be sincere than sarcastic in this brief format.
4. the cues mention that this is an informal, reactive statement, which aligns more with a spontaneous, non-sarcastic response.

4. the punctuation is just a period at the end.

 CHANDLER: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the very limited context provided in the input text, i don't have enough information to confidently determine whether this is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the brief questions ""what? why?"" could be interpreted in various ways depending on the broader context and tone of the conversation.

however, if i must choose a label based solely on this limited information, i would lean towards:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the questions are very brief and straightforward, which is more typical of genuine inquiries rather than sarcastic remarks.
2. there's no obvious irony or contrasting elements that would suggest sarcasm.
3. short, direct questions like these are common in normal, non-sarcastic conversation when seeking clarification or expressing surprise.

without more context about the situation, the speaker's tone, or the conversation leading up to these questions, it's difficult to definitively determine sarcasm. the label ""not sarcastic"" is a best guess based on the limited information available.",0.0

### label: not sarcastic

the exclamation ""oh! oop!"" by phoebe appears to be a genuine, spontaneous reaction rather than a sarcastic statement. the use of interjections and exclamation marks suggests surprise or a sudden realization, possibly accompanied by a minor mishap or stumble. this kind of brief, reactive dialogue is typically not associated with sarcasm, which often requires more context or a more elaborate setup to convey irony or mock sincerity. the informal, colloquial nature of the utterance further supports the interpretation that this is a straightforward, non-sarcastic expression of surprise or reaction to an unexpected event.",0.0

the statement ""joey: i talk to you and nothin'."" appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration or disappointment rather than sarcasm. the informal language, incomplete sentence structure, and implied contrast suggest a genuine complaint about lack of communication or response. while the tone may be exasperated, it doesn't contain the irony or mocking quality typically associated with sarcasm.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward statement from rachel about discarding something, likely a container or package.
2. the language is casual and conversational, without any obvious irony or contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the trailing off with an ellipsis (...) indicates uncertainty or an unfinished thought, which is more consistent with genuine speech than sarcasm.
4. there are no clear emotional contrasts or exaggerated statements that might indicate sarcastic intent.
5. the use of filler words like ""just"" and casual phrasing like ""gonna"" suggest a natural, non-sarcastic dialogue.

the given dialogue ""ross: yeah. what-what should i do?"" does not contain any indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward question from ross, expressing uncertainty and seeking advice. the repetition of ""what"" suggests hesitation or nervousness, but not sarcasm. the tone and style are consistent with genuine, informal conversation rather than sarcastic speech.",0.0

sarcastic

the question ""for what? for letting you throw me out of your office?"" has a sarcastic tone. ross appears to be using rhetorical questioning and irony to express frustration or disagreement with a previous situation. the phrasing suggests he's sarcastically implying that being thrown out of an office is not something one typically allows or should be grateful for, which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement ""like i have nothing better to do!"" is a clear example of sarcasm. monica is using irony to express her annoyance or frustration, implying that she actually has many other important things to do rather than whatever is being suggested or requested of her. this is a classic sarcastic response used to convey irritation or unwillingness in a indirect, often biting manner.",1.0

3. the use of ""great"" seems sincere in expressing positive sentiment about someone being awake.
4. there are no contradictions, exaggerations, or unexpected twists that might suggest sarcasm.

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward complaint from monica about the difficulties in finding a suitable person to officiate her wedding. while there's some humor in her description, particularly in the last part about staring at ladies, the overall tone and content don't indicate sarcasm. instead, it's a direct expression of frustration with the options they've encountered. the use of colloquial language and the list-like structure of complaints support a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of dissatisfaction.",0.0

this exclamation appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or shock rather than sarcasm. the use of all caps, multiple punctuation marks, and the brief, intense nature of the response all point to a sincere emotional reaction. sarcasm typically involves more context or a mismatch between the words and their intended meaning, which isn't present here. this seems to be monica's authentic reaction to something unexpected or shocking.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, this statement appears to be genuinely enthusiastic and appreciative rather than sarcastic. here's why:

1. emotional words and tone: the phrase ""you have no idea what this means to me!"" indicates strong positive emotion, likely gratitude or excitement.

2. repetition: the repetition of ""ross"" at the beginning emphasizes rachel's emotional state and urgency in addressing him, which is more consistent with sincere emotion than sarcasm.

3. punctuation: the exclamation mark at the end reinforces the intensity of the emotion being expressed.

4. language style: the informal, colloquial phrasing and use of a first name suggest a genuine, heartfelt response rather than a sarcastic one.

5. emotional contrast: while there's a contrast between rachel's intense emotion and the implication that ross might not fully understand its significance, this doesn't indicate sarcasm but rather emphasizes the depth of rachel's feelings.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a sincere expression of gratitude or excitement from rachel to ross, without any indicators of sarcasm or insincerity.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a genuine statement from ross, expressing what he would have done in a hypothetical situation.
2. the stuttering (""i-i-i"") indicates hesitation or nervousness, which is more consistent with sincerity than sarcasm.
3. the informal, conversational tone and incomplete sentence structure suggest a natural, spontaneous response rather than a crafted sarcastic remark.
4. there's no clear indication of irony, exaggeration, or contrasting emotions that typically characterize sarcastic statements.
5. the implied emotional tension and awkwardness in the statement align more with a sincere admission than a sarcastic comment.

ROSS: DANGER,"RACHEL: I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over
 PHOEBE: No Rachel! They got here first! Why is Ross doing that?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input ""ross: danger"" and the current cues, i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the text is too brief and lacks context to make a reliable judgment about sarcasm. 

without additional context or information about the tone, situation, or speaker's intent, it's not possible to accurately label this as either 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. the word ""danger"" on its own is typically used to convey a serious warning, but without knowing more about the context in which it's being used, we can't determine if it's meant literally or sarcastically.

therefore, i cannot assign a definitive label to this input based solely on the given information.",0.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the short exclamation ""yeah! look!"" by joey appears to be a genuine, enthusiastic response rather than a sarcastic one. the use of exclamation marks and the emotional word ""yeah"" convey excitement or enthusiasm. there's no indication of irony, contrast, or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the casual, informal language style and the directive ""look!"" further support that this is likely a sincere, non-sarcastic utterance.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

the statement ""you'd better act surprised."" appears to be a straightforward instruction or suggestion from joey to someone else. while it could potentially be used in a sarcastic context depending on the broader conversation, the single line itself does not inherently contain sarcasm. it's a direct imperative statement without any clear indicators of irony or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm. therefore, based solely on this isolated line, it's most appropriate to classify it as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the comprehensive cues provided and the nature of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of concern or worry about a potential future situation. the use of emphatic punctuation, the rhetorical question format, and the emotional tone all suggest that monica is sincerely asking about the consequences of someone not being included in something. while the statement is emotionally charged, it doesn't display the typical hallmarks of sarcasm such as irony, mocking tone, or saying the opposite of what is meant. instead, it's a straightforward, albeit anxious, inquiry about a problematic situation.",0.0

the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm. rachel appears to be genuinely trying to calm others down. the elongation of ""doooo"" seems to emphasize her own relaxed state, reinforcing her message rather than contradicting it sarcastically. the informal, casual speech pattern and use of filler words like ""okay"" also suggest a sincere, relaxed tone rather than a sarcastic one. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement comes across as a straightforward attempt to encourage others to relax.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a casual, informal question using colloquial language.
2. there's no clear indication of contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typical in sarcasm.
3. the speaker (rachel) seems to be genuinely asking for clarification or agreement, using filler words and slang that are common in sincere, informal speech.
4. the cues don't suggest any underlying tone or context that would imply sarcasm.
5. without additional context indicating otherwise, it's more likely that this is a straightforward, non-sarcastic question in casual conversation.",0.0

 CHANDLER: I've got canned goods.
 JOEY: Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
",FRIENDS,1,"considering the context and the cue provided, i'll analyze this and provide a label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the phrase ""excellent hole, joe"" is brief and seems to be a comment on someone's action or creation.
2. the word ""excellent"" is indeed positive, as noted in the cue.
3. however, in sitcom contexts (which this appears to be from, given the character name chandler), such brief, overly positive statements are often used sarcastically, especially when commenting on something as mundane as a ""hole.""
4. chandler, as a character from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor.
5. without more context, the brevity and potential mismatch between the highly positive ""excellent"" and the simple object of a ""hole"" suggests this is likely a sarcastic comment rather than genuine praise.

therefore, while the word ""excellent"" is positive, the overall context and delivery suggest this is most likely a sarcastic statement.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
while the statement is emphatic and could potentially be used sarcastically in certain contexts, the cues provided don't indicate any clear markers of sarcasm. the exclamatory tone, formal language, and authoritative style suggest a genuine statement about the inaccessibility of the king. the hyperbole identified is a common rhetorical device used for emphasis, which doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm. without additional context that might suggest irony or contradiction, it's more likely that this statement is meant to be taken at face value as a declaration of the king's isolation or the strict rules surrounding access to him.",0.0

 ROSS: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the context implies that chandler has been caught in a fabrication, which is often a setup for sarcastic responses in comedic situations.

2. the exclamatory nature of the statement and the emphasis on ""it's not a real game!"" suggests an exaggerated or dramatic admission, which is characteristic of sarcastic delivery.

3. the cue mentioning ""real"" as a key emotional word implying frustration or exasperation aligns with the sarcastic tone of someone admitting to making something up.

4. the informal, conversational tone and exclamatory sentences described in the language style analysis are often used to convey sarcasm in dialogue.

5. chandler, as a character (likely from the tv show ""friends""), is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks, which further supports this interpretation.

while the statement itself is factual (chandler is admitting he made up the game), the delivery and context strongly suggest a sarcastic tone, making ""sarcastic"" the most appropriate label for this dialogue.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic because:

1. the tone is exaggerated and overly enthusiastic about watching naked dancers, which is not typically how someone would sincerely encourage this activity.

2. the use of phrases like ""stop being such a wuss"" is often associated with sarcastic or mocking encouragement.

3. the context suggests this is probably phoebe from the tv show ""friends,"" who often uses sarcasm and unconventional statements for comedic effect.

4. the overall phrasing and exclamation at the end give it a dramatic, over-the-top quality that's characteristic of sarcastic statements.

therefore, considering these factors, i believe this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine encouragement.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone of the text appears lighthearted and casual, but not overtly sarcastic.
2. the language style is informal and conversational, which is consistent with a genuine request made in a friendly manner.
3. there's a hint of humor or flirtatiousness in asking for ""a date if you're given' 'em out,"" but this seems more like a playful addition rather than sarcasm.
4. the lack of clear emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices typically associated with sarcasm supports a non-sarcastic interpretation.
5. the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit casual, request for cheesecake with an added humorous or flirtatious comment about a date.

while the statement is playful, it doesn't seem to convey the opposite of its literal meaning, which is a key characteristic of sarcasm. therefore, ""not sarcastic"" seems to be the most appropriate label for this text.",0.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the emotional contrast cue indicates a potential mismatch between joey's enthusiastic expression and the typical feelings associated with early mornings.

2. the use of multiple exclamation marks and the overly enthusiastic tone (""i love that guy!"", ""morning's here!"") seems exaggerated, especially when talking about mornings, which many people find challenging.

3. the rhetorical question ""are you kidding?"" at the beginning sets up a context that suggests the following statement might not be entirely sincere.

4. the repetition of ""morning's here! morning is here,"" with slight variation, adds to the sense of overemphasis that is often associated with sarcasm.

these elements combined strongly suggest that joey is likely being sarcastic about his love for mornings or the person associated with mornings (possibly an overly cheerful roommate or a morning radio host). the exaggerated enthusiasm is probably meant to convey the opposite sentiment - that he actually finds mornings or this morning person annoying.",1.0

3. the informal language (""yeah"") and simple affirmation (""i'm fine"") are common in casual, non-sarcastic conversation.

### label: not sarcastic

the given text ""monica: well, don't 'cha wanna?"" appears to be a straightforward question asked in a casual, informal manner. the use of colloquial contractions like ""don't'cha"" and ""wanna"" indicates a relaxed, conversational tone rather than a sarcastic one. there are no clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically signal sarcasm. the question seems to be a genuine inquiry about someone's desire or willingness to do something, posed in a friendly, informal way.",0.0

 JOEY: How'd you get to that?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the given input, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the use of euphemism (""breakfast adventure"") to likely refer to a more intimate or problematic encounter, which is a common sarcastic technique.

2. the implied tone of mild accusation or frustration, as noted in the emotional words analysis.

3. the overall sarcastic tone identified in the rhetorical devices analysis, particularly in how chandler seems to be indirectly criticizing the ""breakfast adventure"" and its consequences.

4. the contrast between the seemingly casual phrase ""little breakfast adventure"" and the implication of significant damage to furniture, which is a hallmark of sarcastic understatement.

5. the character chandler from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic humor, which adds contextual support to this interpretation.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the statement is indeed sarcastic, using understated language to express disapproval or criticism.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
while the question ""so we'll just stay married forever?"" might seem to have a sarcastic tone on its own, the full context and analysis provided in the cues indicate that this is more likely a genuine expression of surprise, confusion, and concern rather than sarcasm. the stuttering ""what-wh-what"" at the beginning clearly shows rachel is caught off guard and genuinely struggling to process the information she's just received. this reaction appears too authentic and emotionally charged to be sarcastic. the question that follows seems to be more rhetorical, expressing disbelief and possibly seeking clarification or reassurance, rather than conveying sarcasm.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
while the text shows emotion and emphasis through repetition and punctuation, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the exchange appears to be a genuine expression of confusion or frustration, rather than a sarcastic remark. the repetition of ""what's going on"" with different punctuation suggests sincere bewilderment or agitation, not irony or mockery typically associated with sarcasm. the exclamation points and informal language style further reinforce the impression of genuine emotional intensity rather than sarcastic undertones.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text is extremely brief and straightforward, consisting only of ""ross: thank you.""
2. ""thank you"" is a standard expression of gratitude, which on its own does not indicate sarcasm.
3. there are no contextual clues, tone indicators, or additional information that would suggest any sarcastic intent.
4. the cues provided do not identify any elements typically associated with sarcasm, such as irony, exaggeration, or contrasting emotions.
5. the language style is described as formal and polite, which aligns more with a genuine expression of thanks rather than sarcasm.

without any contradictory evidence or context that might suggest otherwise, it's most reasonable to interpret this simple ""thank you"" as a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of gratitude.",0.0

4. short exclamations like this are often sincere reactions rather than sarcastic comments.

based on the provided cues and the context of monica's exclamation, i believe the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""

the use of double exclamation marks and the emphatic denial (""you had no relationship!!"") suggests an exaggerated response that is likely meant to convey sarcasm. the emotional contrast between anger/frustration and dismissiveness further supports this interpretation.

in sarcastic speech, people often use exaggerated emphasis or extreme statements to convey the opposite of what they're literally saying or to mock someone else's claim. monica's statement appears to be doing just that – using an overly dramatic denial to sarcastically dismiss someone's assertion about having had a relationship.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement is brief and factual, simply indicating that something happened ""months ago.""
2. there's no clear emotional contrast or exaggeration that typically characterizes sarcasm.
3. the use of ""like"" as a filler word and the informal tone suggest casual speech rather than sarcastic intent.

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""i can show you an id if you want?"" appears to be a straightforward, polite offer. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the language is neutral, concise, and practical. the use of a question mark suggests it's a genuine inquiry or offer, rather than a sarcastic remark. the informal and colloquial nature of the statement aligns with normal, sincere communication in many contexts where identification might be required or requested.",0.0

the input text shows several indicators of sarcasm:

1. repetition: the double ""okay, okay"" suggests frustration or exasperation, often used sarcastically.
2. contrast: the statement ""i do not always have to be"" implies pushing back against an expectation, which is a common sarcastic device.
3. tone: the informal, conversational style combined with the punctuation (comma before the repeated ""okay"") suggests a sarcastic delivery.
4. context: while we don't have full context, this type of statement is often used sarcastically to mock or criticize an implied expectation.

the speaker, ross, appears to be sarcastically responding to an unstated pressure or expectation to always be ""okay."" the repetition and phrasing suggest he's using sarcasm to express frustration or disagreement with this expectation.",1.0

 JOEY: Yeah, we look great together.
 CHANDLER: Okay.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe the correct label for this input is:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the exaggerated enthusiasm (""wow!"") followed immediately by a premature and over-the-top speculation about future children suggests a mocking or ironic tone.

2. the contrast between the initial excitement and the hypothetical scenario about kids implies an intentional overreaction, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

3. the abrupt leap from an initial interaction to imagining children together is so socially inappropriate that it's likely meant to be humorous or sarcastic rather than sincere.

4. in the context of a sitcom or romantic comedy (which this dialogue seems to fit), such an over-eager response is often used for comedic effect, typically through sarcasm.

5. the exclamation marks and enthusiasm, when coupled with such a forward-thinking statement, create a sense of irony that's characteristic of sarcastic speech.

while it's possible this could be a genuine, albeit socially awkward, expression of enthusiasm, the combination of factors strongly suggests this is meant to be interpreted as a sarcastic comment, likely poking fun at the idea of moving too fast in a relationship or overreacting to a minor interaction.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a genuine expression of disbelief and mild anger. the speaker (ross) is directly stating his emotions without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the keywords and emotional contrasts extracted support this interpretation:

1. ""i can't believe it"" expresses genuine surprise or disbelief.
2. ""can i tell you something?"" indicates a sincere desire to share feelings.
3. ""i'm a little mad at him now"" is a straightforward admission of anger.

the combination of these elements suggests that ross is being honest about his feelings rather than using sarcasm. the contrasting emotions (disbelief and anger) are both presented in a direct manner, which is more characteristic of sincere communication than sarcastic speech.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the available cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

the question format, informal speech, and potentially incredulous tone suggested in the cues, combined with the seemingly absurd idea of protecting someone from a tornado, strongly hint at a sarcastic statement. chandler's character in the tv show ""friends"" is also known for his sarcastic humor, which further supports this interpretation. the rhetorical question format is often used to deliver sarcastic comments, emphasizing the perceived ridiculousness of the situation being referenced.",1.0

4. there's no clear contrast or irony in the statement that would indicate sarcasm.
5. the informal, friendly language style is consistent with a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the input text and the available cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the tone and content of chandler's statement suggest a sarcastic remark, likely poking fun at someone's claim that chasing a churro vendor counts as jogging. the informal language, use of ""first off all"" (likely meant to be ""first of all""), and the humorous contrast between actual jogging and pursuing a snack vendor all point to a sarcastic comment typical of chandler's character in the sitcom ""friends.""",1.0

the statement ""i still don't know how that happened"" in reference to getting someone pregnant is a clear use of irony, which is a common element in sarcastic speech. the speaker is likely feigning ignorance about a well-known biological process, creating a humorous or self-deprecating tone. this ironic understatement is a hallmark of sarcasm, used here possibly to deflect responsibility or express surprise at an unexpected situation. therefore, based on the rhetorical device identified and the context of the statement, i can confidently label this input as ""sarcastic"".",1.0

label: not sarcastic

this line appears to be a straightforward comedic dialogue, likely from a sitcom or similar context. joey is recounting a mispronunciation, which is presented as a genuine mistake rather than a sarcastic comment. the humor comes from the malapropism (""squatternut buash"" instead of ""butternut squash""), but there's no indication of sarcastic intent. the tone seems to be one of confusion or amusement at the verbal slip-up, rather than sarcasm.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward request from monica to borrow back a broiling pan.
2. the language is casual and conversational, which is typical for everyday dialogue.
3. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory statements.
4. the emotional tone seems neutral, without any strong emotional content that might suggest sarcasm.

5. without additional context, the default interpretation of ""uh-huh!"" would be a straightforward, non-sarcastic affirmation.

5. without additional context or tone indicators, it's most likely a straightforward use of this common interjection.

therefore, based on the information available, this statement is more likely to be a genuine expression rather than a sarcastic one.",0.0
PHOEBE: Okay?,"PHOEBE: Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given cues and the input text ""phoebe: okay?"", i can confidently provide a label:

### label: not sarcastic

this brief dialogue snippet doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. the word ""okay?"" used by phoebe appears to be a straightforward question or seeking confirmation, which is a common use of the word in casual conversation. there's no context or tone that suggests any ironic or mocking intent, which are typically present in sarcastic statements. the brevity and simplicity of the statement further support a literal, non-sarcastic interpretation.",0.0
"ROSS: You and I, we're interfacing.","ROSS: So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... ...
 PERSON: and live forever as a machine!
 ROSS: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

sarcastic

the reasoning behind this judgment includes:

1. the use of ""interfacing"" as a euphemism for communication or interaction in a personal context suggests a humorous or ironic tone.

2. the contrast between the technical term ""interfacing"" and the informal, conversational structure of the sentence creates a comedic effect typical of sarcasm.

3. the character ross (possibly from the tv show ""friends"") is known for often using overly technical or formal language in casual situations for comedic effect.

4. the punctuation, particularly the colon before the statement, suggests this is part of a dialogue where the character might be deliberately using an exaggerated or inappropriate term for comic effect.

5. the brevity and punchiness of the statement align with typical sarcastic delivery in casual conversation.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle and context-dependent, the combination of these elements strongly suggests that this statement is meant to be interpreted as sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

 MONICA: See?
 CHANDLER: Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward declaration of intent without any apparent irony or contradiction.
2. the language is casual and direct, typical of normal conversation.
3. there are no emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the context (preparing for a trip) is practical and doesn't lend itself to sarcasm in this case.
5. the tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, lacking the exaggeration or mockery often associated with sarcastic statements.

therefore, this statement from monica appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of her plans to prepare for an upcoming trip.",0.0

this statement is indeed sarcastic. the verbal irony and paradoxical nature of phoebe's statement strongly indicate sarcasm. she's expressing frustration or annoyance through a contradictory action (leaving to prove she's fine with staying), which is a common sarcastic technique. the exclamation point at the end also adds to the sarcastic tone, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation.",1.0

### label: not sarcastic

the text ""monica: and did he?"" is a simple, straightforward question without any clear indicators of sarcasm. it lacks the typical elements associated with sarcastic statements such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the brevity and directness of the question suggest it is likely a genuine inquiry rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

the contrast between chandler's casual language and the potential underlying emotions, combined with the use of understatement and repetition, suggests that this statement is likely sarcastic. chandler appears to be downplaying the significance of the relationship, which often indicates sarcasm, especially in a comedic context like the tv show ""friends"" where this quote likely originates.",1.0

 PHOEBE: Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
 PERSON: Ohh, so cute.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a direct expression of emotion, with phoebe stating she is ""mad.""
2. the hesitation and filler words (""uh-huh"", ""umm"", ""i'm-i'm"") suggest genuine uncertainty or conflict, rather than sarcastic intent.
3. there are no clear rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that might indicate sarcasm.
4. the informal, conversational tone and simple sentence structure align more with sincere speech than sarcastic commentary.
5. the emotional contrast between being mad and the hesitation suggests internal conflict, but not necessarily sarcasm.

while there is some ambiguity due to the hesitation, the overall context suggests phoebe is expressing genuine, if conflicted, anger rather than using sarcasm.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and input, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the exclamation ""paper cut!"" by chandler appears to be a genuine reaction to experiencing a minor but sudden pain. paper cuts are known to be unexpectedly painful, and the exclamation mark indicates a strong, immediate reaction. there's no contextual information suggesting this is meant to be sarcastic or ironic. the brevity and directness of the statement, along with the emotional cue of pain implied by ""cut,"" suggest this is a straightforward expression of discomfort rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a line from a script, likely a sitcom, featuring the character chandler. the dialogue shows chandler asking for a moment to wake up, followed by a sudden burst of laughter or realization (""ah-ha-ha!!""). this reaction seems genuine rather than sarcastic. the informal tone, use of interjections, and sudden emotional shift from sleepiness to excitement are consistent with sincere, non-sarcastic speech in a casual, comedic context. there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm in this brief exchange.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the rhetorical device present in the text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

the use of hyperbole (""you weren't almost just killed"") is a strong indicator of sarcasm in this context. rachel is likely exaggerating the situation for dramatic effect, using sarcasm to emphasize her point or express frustration. the contrast between the serious implication of nearly being killed and the casual way it's presented suggests a sarcastic tone.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the analysis of the language style, emotional content, and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

the statement ""i don't think you could ever do that"" appears to be a straightforward expression of doubt or disbelief in someone's ability. while it's negative in tone, there's no evidence of irony, exaggeration, or other elements typically associated with sarcasm. the informal, direct language style is consistent with a sincere statement rather than a sarcastic one.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the snippet is too short and lacks sufficient context to make a definitive judgment. 

however, given that:
1. this appears to be dialogue from a tv show or movie script (likely ""friends"" given the character name chandler)
2. the sentence trails off with an ellipsis, suggesting chandler was about to describe someone in a potentially unflattering way
3. chandler's character in ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic humor

there is a possibility that this could be setting up for a sarcastic remark. but without the complete statement or surrounding context, it's impossible to say for certain.

therefore, i cannot assign a definitive label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input text with the information provided.",0.0

1. the statement appears to be a straightforward agreement with someone else's point.
2. there are no clear emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the language style is informal and concise, typical of sincere spoken dialogue.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of informal language and slang (""bitchin"") is typical of sarcastic speech.
2. the rhetorical question structure ""what did you want to show us?"" implies skepticism or disappointment.
3. the contrast between the expectation of being shown something (potentially impressive) and the reality of just seeing a van suggests sarcasm.
4. the use of ""bitchin"" to describe the van is likely ironic, further indicating sarcasm.

this statement appears to be a sarcastic comment, likely expressing disappointment or mockery towards whatever was supposed to be shown, but instead only a van is visible.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this dialogue.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the line ""ross: you still love me?"" appears to be a genuine, vulnerable question rather than a sarcastic statement. the use of ""still"" implies a concern about the continuity of affection, and the direct nature of the question suggests sincerity rather than irony or sarcasm. the emotional word ""love"" is used in its literal sense here, without any apparent contradiction or exaggeration that would typically indicate sarcasm. the questioning tone and the context of seeking reassurance about a relationship are more consistent with a straightforward, non-sarcastic inquiry.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the emotional contrast between the initial ""no!"" and the following positive statement ""i'm so happy for them!"" is a common sarcastic structure.

2. the exclamation marks add emphasis to both parts, heightening the contrast and likely indicating an exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.

3. the use of ""so happy"" after an initial negative exclamation suggests an overstatement that is characteristic of sarcastic expressions.

4. in context, this response seems to be an ironic or sarcastic reaction to news about others, where the speaker is pretending to be happy while actually expressing displeasure or jealousy.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that rachel's statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than genuinely expressing happiness.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

the text does not exhibit characteristics of sarcasm. instead, it appears to be a sincere, albeit awkward, attempt at an apology or explanation. chandler is directly acknowledging a wrongdoing (""i never should have kissed your girlfriend"") and seems to be about to offer an explanation or justification (as indicated by the ""but i'm"" at the end). the language is straightforward and lacks the irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. the emotional cues of guilt and attempted justification, along with the apologetic language, suggest this is a genuine statement rather than a sarcastic one.",0.0

 CHANDLER: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
 MONICA: What?!
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the cues provided and the nature of the input text, i believe this line is sarcastic. here's why:

1. context: the line is attributed to chandler, likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor.

2. metaphor: using ""ruptured spleen"" as a metaphor for oneself is an exaggerated and unlikely self-description, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. self-deprecation: the cues mention that this line suggests self-deprecation, which is often conveyed through sarcasm.

4. tone: the cues indicate a humorous or self-deprecating tone, which aligns with sarcastic delivery.

5. sitcom dialogue: the language style is described as potentially typical of sitcom dialogue, where sarcasm is a common form of humor.

6. incongruity: there's an inherent incongruity between identifying oneself as a medical condition, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

given these factors, it's highly likely that chandler is not seriously claiming to be a ruptured spleen, but rather using sarcasm to make a point or joke about his current state or situation.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the exclamatory tone and use of ""oh-oh"" suggest genuine concern or surprise, rather than sarcasm.
2. the phrase ""risky little game"" appears to be a sincere assessment of a situation, not a sarcastic remark.
3. there are no clear indicators of irony or contrasting emotions that would typically signal sarcasm.
4. the informal, conversational style is consistent with expressing a genuine reaction rather than a sarcastic one.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, in this case, the straightforward nature of the statement and the lack of contradictory cues suggest that rachel is likely expressing a genuine concern about a risky situation rather than making a sarcastic comment.",0.0

### explanation:

based on the given cues and analysis of the input text, i believe this statement is not sarcastic. here's why:

1. emotional content: the phrase ""bums me out"" expresses genuine disappointment or sadness, which aligns with the literal meaning of the statement.

2. context: the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of phoebe's feelings about her current situation, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning.

3. language style: the casual, conversational tone suggests sincerity rather than sarcasm, which often relies on more exaggerated or formal language for effect.

4. lack of contradictory elements: there are no obvious contradictions or exaggerations that would typically signal sarcasm.

5. hyperbole: while ""all i ever get to do now is pregnant stuff"" is an exaggeration, it's used to emphasize her point rather than to convey sarcasm.

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of phoebe's frustration with the limitations she's experiencing due to her pregnancy, rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the input text ""hey."" and the current cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the single-word greeting ""hey."" is a neutral, casual salutation that doesn't contain any inherent sarcasm. the cues provided reinforce this interpretation:

1. it's described as informal and colloquial, which is typical for sincere greetings.
2. it's noted as being concise and direct, without any additional context that might suggest sarcasm.
3. the analysis mentions that there are no emotional contrasts or specific emotions conveyed.
4. no rhetorical devices or figures of speech are present that might indicate sarcasm.

given these factors, there's no evidence to suggest that this greeting is sarcastic. it appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic greeting.",0.0

### explanation:
based on the cues provided and the input text, this statement is clearly ""not sarcastic."" the text displays genuine distress, denial, or disbelief, which are inconsistent with sarcasm. the repetitive use of ""no,"" the stammering speech pattern, and the overall emotional tone suggest that rachel is genuinely upset or in denial about something. sarcasm typically involves irony or saying the opposite of what is meant, which is not present here. instead, we see a direct, emotionally charged response that appears sincere in its distress.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the exclamation ""whoa, maybe i was!"" by joey appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or sudden realization rather than sarcasm. the use of ""whoa"" as an interjection typically indicates genuine surprise or excitement. the phrase ""maybe i was"" suggests that joey is considering or accepting a possibility he hadn't before, which aligns more with sincere realization than sarcastic intent.

the exclamation mark at the end emphasizes the emotional impact of this realization. the informal, colloquial style and short, fragmented structure are consistent with natural speech in a moment of surprise or epiphany.

without broader context, there's no clear indication of irony or contradiction that would typically characterize sarcasm. the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit excited, acknowledgment of a possibility, making it more likely to be not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

my judgment is that this text is ""not sarcastic"" for the following reasons:

1. the language is straightforward and lacks the typical markers of sarcasm, such as exaggeration or irony.

2. chandler's speech pattern is casual and hesitant, using filler words like ""yeah"" and ""i mean,"" which suggests he's genuinely asking for permission rather than making a sarcastic comment.

3. the rhetorical question at the end (""is it okay if they come visit?"") appears to be a sincere request rather than a sarcastic remark.

4. there's no clear contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

5. the overall tone suggests uncertainty and a mild attempt at persuasion, rather than the mocking or critical tone often associated with sarcasm.

therefore, based on the given cues and analysis of the text, i confidently label this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

the statement by chandler is clearly a sarcastic remark. it combines a mundane situation (talking to a lifeguard) with an absurdly exaggerated scenario (dismantling a nuclear device) that would never actually occur in a typical lifeguard's duties. this juxtaposition of the ordinary with the extraordinary is a classic hallmark of sarcasm, used here for comedic effect. the absurdity of the situation makes it clear that chandler is not being literal, but rather using sarcasm to humorously excuse himself from a conversation.",1.0

 RACHEL: All right, bye-bye.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward plea or argument from chandler, likely a character from the tv show ""friends."" the tone is earnest and direct, without any obvious irony or sarcasm. chandler is emphasizing his point about janice, repeating her name for emphasis, and defending himself against an accusation of being picky. the language and structure don't suggest any sarcastic intent, but rather a sincere attempt to make a point in a conversation.",0.0

 PHOEBE: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
 CHANDLER: I'm free! I'm free!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the phrase ""that oughta do it"" is a common, straightforward expression used to indicate that a task has been completed or that something should be sufficient.
2. there's no clear contrast or irony in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the informal, casual tone (""oughta"" instead of ""ought to"") is consistent with sincere, everyday speech rather than sarcastic intent.
4. without additional context suggesting otherwise, this appears to be a simple, literal statement about completing a task or reaching a satisfactory point in some action.

therefore, the most appropriate label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

the given input is a straightforward piece of dialogue that shows nervousness and hesitation, but does not contain any elements of sarcasm. ross is clearly trying to deliver some difficult news about ""someone else"" in a relationship context. the repetition, use of filler words like ""umm,"" and the hesitant phrasing all indicate genuine emotional discomfort rather than any attempt at sarcasm or irony. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm, particularly situational irony. chandler is using a polite excuse (not wanting to be rude) to justify staying, when it's likely he has other, unstated reasons for not wanting to leave. this mismatch between the stated reason and the probable true motivation is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

the informal language, use of filler words, and the roundabout way of expressing his desire to stay all contribute to the sarcastic tone. additionally, the name ""chandler"" likely refers to the character from ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic wit, further supporting this interpretation.",1.0
"PERSON: Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.","ROSS: Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
 RACHEL: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" based on the following cues:

1. hyperbole: the statement uses exaggeration by suggesting someone becomes a hero in just 21 hours, which is likely an unrealistic timeframe for such a transformation.

2. implied context: the brevity and structure of the statement suggest it's a comment on someone's achievement, but the exaggeration implies it may not be as impressive as claimed.

3. contrast between time and status: there's an implicit contrast between the relatively short time period (21 hours) and the grand status (hero), which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

4. informal tone: the casual, conversational style is often used in sarcastic remarks.

5. lack of additional context: without more information, the statement seems to stand alone as a commentary, which can be interpreted as a sarcastic quip rather than genuine praise.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically rather than literally or sincerely.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
this statement from monica appears to be an angry or frustrated outburst rather than sarcasm. the use of ""no!!"" with exclamation points indicates strong emotion. the phrase ""screwing us all day"" is a direct accusation expressing genuine frustration or anger. there's no subtle irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. instead, this seems to be a straightforward expression of negative sentiment, likely in response to someone's actions that monica perceives as harmful or unfair to her and others.",0.0

not sarcastic

the statement is a straightforward, factual declaration about ross's upcoming commitment. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the tone is informative and potentially urgent, but not sarcastic. the language style, punctuation, and content all align with a sincere statement about teaching a graduate seminar soon.",0.0

 PERSON: What?
 ROSS: Stupid balls are in the way.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the use of ""oh well"" at the beginning suggests resignation or disappointment, which contrasts with the seemingly positive assessment that follows.

2. the phrase ""most constructive solution"" is likely being used ironically, especially given the context of resignation implied by ""oh well.""

3. the cues mention the potential for sarcasm or dry humor in the use of ""the most constructive solution.""

4. the contrast between the resigned tone and the ostensibly positive evaluation creates a subtle emotional contrast typical of sarcastic statements.

5. while the statement appears straightforward on the surface, the combination of resignation and praising something as ""most constructive"" suggests an underlying sarcastic intent.

this interpretation assumes that the context implies the solution being referred to is actually not very constructive, making ross's statement a sarcastic comment on the situation.",1.0

CHANDLER: Pheebs?,"CHANDLER: I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the brief input ""chandler: pheebs?"", there isn't enough context to determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. this appears to be a simple line of dialogue where chandler is addressing or calling out to someone named pheebs (likely short for phoebe). without additional context or tone indicators, it's not possible to reliably categorize this as sarcastic or not sarcastic.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the straightforward nature of the address, i would lean towards labeling this as:

2. there's no obvious contrast between literal meaning and intended meaning, which is often present in sarcastic statements.
3. the language style is informal and straightforward, typical of genuine dialogue rather than sarcastic remarks.
4. the ellipsis (...) suggests hesitation or thoughtfulness, rather than a sarcastic pause.
5. without more context, the statement about needing a ""good pill"" seems to be a genuine, albeit vague, suggestion rather than a sarcastic comment.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, there isn't enough evidence in this short text or the provided cues to confidently label it as sarcastic. therefore, ""not sarcastic"" appears to be the more appropriate label.",0.0

without additional context or cues, it's not possible to accurately label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. the statement is too brief and ambiguous to make a definitive judgment.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward question from a tv script, likely from the show ""friends"" given the character names.
2. the language is casual and conversational, with no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration or irony.
3. the hesitation (""umm"") suggests genuine curiosity or perhaps slight awkwardness, which is typical in sincere conversation.
4. there are no contrasting emotions or rhetorical devices that might signal sarcasm.
5. the question itself is a simple inquiry about how an event went, without any hidden meaning or satirical undertone.

therefore, this dialogue line can be confidently classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
MONICA: What are you up too?,"JOEY: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this short piece of dialogue doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. it's a straightforward question from monica asking what someone is doing. the informal tone and minor spelling error (""too"" instead of ""to"") are common in casual conversation and don't suggest sarcasm. without additional context or tone indicators, this appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic inquiry.",0.0
PERSON: Yes it is.,"PHOEBE: Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer,fireman, can-can I help you?
 PERSON: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute. That's not mine.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited context provided, i cannot reliably determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the phrase ""yes it is"" is too short and lacking in context to make a definitive judgment about sarcasm. sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, context, and the broader conversation, which are not available here.

without additional information about the conversation, the speaker's tone, or what they're responding to, it's not possible to confidently label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. the statement could be a genuine affirmation or a sarcastic response, depending on the context.

given this uncertainty, i would refrain from assigning a label in this case. if a choice must be made, the default assumption for such a simple affirmative statement would typically be:

label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this label is assigned with very low confidence due to the lack of context.",0.0

 RACHEL: Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of desire for some assurance or guarantee, without any evident sarcastic undertones. the language used is mild and hedging (""it would be nice""), which is more consistent with a genuine, non-sarcastic request. the context suggests rachel is expressing a sincere wish for more certainty in a situation, rather than using irony or sarcasm to make a point.",0.0

explanation:
the single-word response ""no."" does not contain any indicators of sarcasm. it's a direct, brief answer that doesn't show any contradiction between literal and intended meaning, which is typically present in sarcastic statements. without additional context or tone indicators, this straightforward negative response should be interpreted at face value as not sarcastic.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is brief and lacks clear indicators of sarcasm.
2. the language used is casual and conversational, which doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm.
3. there are no obvious emotional contrasts or exaggerations that typically accompany sarcastic statements.
4. the phrase ""if you wanna put a label on it"" suggests a neutral or slightly reluctant attitude towards categorization, but doesn't inherently convey sarcasm.
5. without additional context, the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit casual, response to a previous comment or question.

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the line appears to be a witty, humorous comment typical of sitcom dialogue, using a play on words and subverting expectations in a way characteristic of sarcasm. the casual tone and implied context also support this interpretation. while not overtly emotional, the statement has a lighthearted, comedic quality consistent with sarcastic banter.",1.0
"MONICA: Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!","CHANDLER: Do you know what just happened?
 MONICA: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
 CHANDLER: No. We were in the middle of sex .. and
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the sudden shift from a strong negative reaction (""nooo!"") to extreme positive statements (""best time ever!"" and ""you rocked my world!"") is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

2. the exaggerated nature of the positive statements, especially following an initial denial, suggests that monica is not being sincere but rather using hyperbole to convey the opposite of what she's saying.

3. the exclamation marks and the over-the-top praise are typical linguistic markers of sarcastic speech, especially when contrasted with the opening denial.

this abrupt change in tone and the use of excessive enthusiasm after an initial negative reaction strongly indicate that monica is being sarcastic in her response.",1.0

 ROSS: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
 PHOEBE: Oh, it's not!
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine exclamation of surprise or concern rather than sarcasm. the use of ""seriously"" and the exclamation mark emphasize rachel's sincerity about something that is actually moving. without additional context that might suggest irony or contradiction, it's most likely a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward statement from monica about a phone call she received from carol. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the content or structure of the sentence. the inverted sentence structure (anastrophe) is more likely used for emphasis or dramatic effect in dialogue rather than to convey sarcasm. the content is simple and informative, describing a sequence of events (carol calling, thanking for lasagna, monica asking about it) without any apparent irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the informal, conversational style is consistent with normal dialogue and doesn't imply any hidden meaning or sarcastic intent.",0.0

2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory statements.
3. the language style is conversational and straightforward, without any obvious emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the content seems to be a genuine reminder or statement about christmas-related activities, without any apparent hidden meaning or mocking tone.
5. the ellipsis at the end suggests an incomplete thought rather than a sarcastic pause.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the information provided and the context of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is a simple statement by ross, denying something and then characterizing it as flattery.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the repetition of ""no"" seems to emphasize sincerity rather than sarcasm.
4. the word ""flattery"" is being used in its straightforward meaning, without any apparent subversion or irony.
5. the informal, conversational tone doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm in this context.

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, there's no strong evidence in this brief statement to suggest it's sarcastic. it appears to be a straightforward denial followed by a characterization of something as flattery.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the phrase ""chan love"" is indeed a playful, self-referential term used by chandler, and the way he's using it in this context strongly suggests sarcasm. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the show friends, and this line fits his typical self-deprecating, ironic style. he's likely making a joke about his own appeal or lack thereof, using an exaggerated third-person reference to himself. the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous, sarcastic comment on the situation.",1.0

 ROSE: I'll be fine
 BLANCHE: Is this about Arnie?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the given input and the cue provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the reason for this label is that the statement appears to be using irony to make a humorous point. the idea that someone would be genuinely upset about changes to the taste of coca-cola is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual situation. the use of such an trivial reason for being upset is a common sarcastic technique to highlight the absurdity of a situation or to mock someone's overreaction to minor issues. the contrast between the serious emotional state (""upset"") and the frivolous reason (changing taste of coke) strongly suggests sarcastic intent.",1.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and the content of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement ""i don't know rose, maybe mary poppins has an italian cousin"" appears to be a sarcastic response. the speaker (dorothy) is likely responding to something rose said or suggested with a playful, absurd suggestion. the reference to mary poppins having an italian cousin is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous and exaggerated way to dismiss or poke fun at whatever rose might have proposed. this kind of witty, imaginative retort is a classic example of sitcom-style sarcasm, particularly fitting for characters like those from ""the golden girls,"" which this dialogue seems to evoke.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the input ""dorothy: on the home shopping network"" appears to be a simple, straightforward line of dialogue or stage direction. there are no indicators of sarcasm present in this brief text. the cues provided also don't suggest any sarcastic intent, emotional contrast, or use of rhetorical devices that might imply sarcasm. the statement is neutral and descriptive, likely just indicating a character's location or action. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement should be classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the information provided and the nature of the input text, i believe my judgment is reliable enough to assign a label directly.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be nonsensical rather than sarcastic. the mention of ""crocodin turbs"" (which is not a real term) and the unusual reason for being upset don't exhibit the typical characteristics of sarcasm, such as irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. instead, it seems to be a fictional or nonsensical statement without clear sarcastic intent.",0.0
DOROTHY: The liberarche marquee at Caesar's palace,"DOROTHY: Whop, it is really coming down.
 ROSE: Whats coming down?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the available cues and the input text, i don't have enough context to confidently determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the text appears to be a simple statement or observation, possibly part of a dialogue or script, mentioning a marquee at caesar's palace (likely referring to liberace, though misspelled). without more context or clear indicators of sarcasm, i cannot reliably assign a label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this isolated statement.",0.0

 ROSE: You going out?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and the content of dorothy's statement, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

dorothy's response is clearly sarcastic. she uses exaggeration (112 degrees) and presents an absurd scenario (eating enchiladas in extreme heat) to mock or criticize an unheard suggestion or question. the blunt, informal tone and the use of hyperbole are strong indicators of sarcasm in this context.",1.0

"DOROTHY: No, I am depressed becaues Phillis George left the morning news.","ROSE: Are you depressed about Glen?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement appears sarcastic because it's unlikely that someone would be genuinely depressed over a news anchor leaving a morning show. the exaggerated emotional response (being ""depressed"") to a relatively minor event (phillis george leaving the morning news) creates the sarcastic tone. this overstatement is a common technique used in sarcasm to emphasize the speaker's actual feelings, which are likely the opposite of what's being stated.",1.0
"DOROTHY: No Blanche, with a venus fly trap","DOROTHY: Morning everybody, Rose honey I hope you don't mind, I borrowed your golf club, I have a date to play this morning.
 BLANCHE: With a man?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the information provided and the brief input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a simple, direct statement from a character named dorothy to someone named blanche.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.
3. the mention of a venus fly trap seems to be a straightforward reference rather than a sarcastic comment.
4. without additional context, the statement appears to be literal rather than sarcastic.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle and context-dependent, there's not enough information in this brief line to suggest it's meant sarcastically. the statement seems to be a literal response or instruction regarding a venus fly trap.",0.0

DOROTHY: Lords of Arabia,"DOROTHY: Well ofcourse Blanche , they did it in that movie.
 ROSE: What movie?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the input ""dorothy: lords of arabia"" and the current cues provided, there is not enough context or information to determine whether this text is sarcastic or not. the phrase appears to be a title or heading, possibly for a book, movie, or other work. without additional context or surrounding text, it's impossible to reliably judge whether sarcasm is intended.

therefore, i cannot confidently assign either the ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" label to this input. the text itself is neutral and doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm or lack thereof.",0.0

 ROSE: You worried she might be Gina's?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward expression of concern from dorothy about someone potentially being associated with or belonging to ""phir resuda"". the use of ""worried"" indicates genuine anxiety, and there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the statement seems to be a sincere expression of worry in what appears to be a dialogue or script format.",0.0
"DOROTHY: Oh ma no, it was a little girl selling girl scout toilets.","DOROTHY: Oh fine we will!
 SOPHIA: Is that Paolo?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" for the following reasons:

1. unexpected substitution: the phrase ""girl scout toilets"" is clearly a deliberate substitution for the expected ""girl scout cookies."" this unexpected twist is a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. absurdity: the idea of a little girl selling toilets instead of cookies creates an absurd scenario, which is often used in sarcastic humor.

3. context-dependent humor: the joke relies on the listener's familiarity with girl scout cookie sales, subverting this common experience for comedic effect.

4. informal language: the use of ""oh ma no"" at the beginning sets a casual tone that's often associated with sarcastic remarks in conversation.

5. implied tone: while there are no explicit emotional words, the structure of the sentence implies a deadpan or matter-of-fact delivery of an absurd statement, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic, likely in response to a misunderstanding or as part of a humorous exchange.",1.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the analysis of emotional tone, keywords, and rhetorical devices provided in the cues, i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

the statement exhibits clear use of hyperbole and sarcasm, which are strong indicators of sarcastic intent. the exaggerated phrase ""hack herself to death"" and the overall tone suggest that dorothy is not sincerely recommending that rose watch someone cough severely. instead, she's likely using sarcasm to express frustration or to make a point about the absurdity of such an action. this kind of dramatic overstatement is a common feature of sarcastic speech, especially in dialogue from tv shows or plays, which this input appears to be from.",1.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the given information and cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

explanation: the response ""no rose, at a pie eating contest"" appears to be a sarcastic retort. the context suggests this is likely a response to an unheard question or statement from rose. dorothy's answer is using sarcasm to humorously point out that whatever rose suggested or asked about is obviously not related to a pie eating contest. the dry, deadpan delivery implied by the short response is a classic form of sarcasm, especially in sitcom-style dialogue. this fits with the cues mentioning the informal, conversational tone and the likely use of sarcasm or dry humor in the context.",1.0

DOROTHY: Show them your slides of Hawaii,"ROSE: Wait donÕt leave me, what will I do if they come back?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the given input and the current cues, i don't have enough information to confidently label this text as either 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. the statement ""dorothy: show them your slides of hawaii"" on its own doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm.

without additional context about the tone, situation, or surrounding dialogue, it's impossible to determine if dorothy is being sincere or sarcastic. this could be a genuine request to show vacation photos, or it could be a sarcastic comment depending on the context.

therefore, i cannot assign a definitive label of 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic' to this input with the information provided.",0.0
DOROTHY: No I am upset because Joe Piscapo didn't get the lead role in rain man.,"DOROTHY: No rose.
 ROSE: Are you upset because Blanche is going to sell the house and we can't live together.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

the statement is highly likely to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. joe piscopo is primarily known as a comedian and not a dramatic actor, making him an unlikely choice for the lead role in a serious drama like ""rain man.""

2. ""rain man"" is a well-known film starring tom cruise and dustin hoffman. the idea of being genuinely upset about joe piscopo not getting the lead role seems absurd given the actual casting and success of the film.

3. the contrast between the serious tone of being ""upset"" and the ridiculous notion of joe piscopo in ""rain man"" creates a humorous incongruity typical of sarcasm.

4. the statement seems designed to subvert expectations, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic comments.

given these factors, the statement appears to be using irony to make a humorous point, likely mocking overreactions to casting decisions or perhaps critiquing joe piscopo's acting abilities. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this input.",1.0
DOROTHY: A bucket of chicked. I hope you like it extra flat and crispy,"ROSE: We brought dinner.
 SOPHIA: What you get?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the contrast between the polite offer (""i hope you like it"") and the unusual description of the chicken as ""extra flat and crispy"" suggests sarcasm.

2. the hyperbolic description of the chicken as ""extra flat and crispy"" is likely an exaggeration used for humorous effect, which is a common feature of sarcasm.

3. these qualities (extra flat and crispy) are not typically desirable for chicken, implying that the chicken may be overcooked or improperly prepared, yet it's being offered as if it's a good thing.

4. the use of ""bucket of chicken"" followed by this unusual description creates a setup and punchline structure often found in sarcastic comments.

while the sarcasm is subtle, these elements combined suggest that dorothy is likely making a sarcastic comment about the quality of the chicken, rather than genuinely offering a desirable meal.",1.0

### label: not sarcastic

the statement ""it's a musical rose"" appears to be a straightforward, descriptive comment made by a character named dorothy. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief line. the context suggests it might be referring to a character or element in a musical production named rose. without any contradictory tone, exaggeration, or contextual clues that would suggest irony or sarcasm, it's most appropriate to interpret this statement as literal and not sarcastic.",0.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of concern. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the speaker, dorothy, is simply expressing worry about a unusual situation involving michael jackson. the informal, conversational tone and the direct expression of emotion (""i'm worried"") further support that this is likely a genuine statement of concern rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

 BLANCHE: Are you upset because you don't know what to do about Al?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can make a judgment on the label:

sarcastic

the text appears to be sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the allusion to jimmy swaggart, a televangelist involved in a scandal, is used in a humorous context.
2. the juxtaposition of a religious figure with a ""motel bill"" implies a scandalous situation, which is often a target for sarcasm.
3. the misspelling of ""swaggart"" as ""swaager"" and ""upset"" as ""supset"" could be intentional to add to the sarcastic tone.
4. the implication that someone is upset because a scandal-ridden televangelist can't pay a motel bill is absurd, which is a common element in sarcastic statements.

while the punctuation and emotional contrasts don't provide strong evidence for sarcasm, the content and context of the statement strongly suggest a sarcastic intent.",1.0

2. there are no obvious emotional contrasts or exaggerations that might suggest sarcasm.
3. the language style is informal and conversational, but not in a way that implies sarcasm.
4. there are no rhetorical devices or wordplay that might indicate sarcastic intent.

sarcastic

the line ""dorothy: in what blanche, dog years?"" strongly implies sarcasm. dorothy appears to be making a mocking or skeptical comment about something blanche has said, likely regarding age. the reference to ""dog years"" suggests that dorothy is humorously implying that blanche's claim about her age is greatly exaggerated or unrealistic. this kind of witty, biting remark is a classic example of sarcasm, especially in the context of comedic dialogue.",1.0

without more surrounding dialogue or situational context, it's impossible to accurately judge whether dorothy is being sincere or sarcastic. the text alone doesn't contain clear markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mock enthusiasm.

label: not sarcastic

the single-word exclamation ""amazing."" appears to be a genuine expression of positive sentiment or appreciation. there's no contextual information or additional cues that would suggest this statement is meant sarcastically. the use of a period at the end of the exclamation could potentially indicate a more subdued or matter-of-fact tone, but it doesn't inherently imply sarcasm. without further context that might contradict or undermine the positive meaning of ""amazing,"" it's most reasonable to interpret this statement as sincere and not sarcastic.",0.0

sarcastic

chandler's line ""oh i am sorry, do you need a break?"" exhibits classic sarcastic characteristics:

1. the use of ""oh"" as an interjection often prefaces sarcastic remarks.

the response from chandler is clearly sarcastic. the cues highlight the emotional contrast between frustration and humor, and the exaggerated comparison of chandler to a horse (referring to saddle bags and chewing hay) is a classic example of sarcasm. this line is using hyperbole and absurd imagery to sarcastically comment on a situation, likely in response to someone treating him in a way he finds demeaning or ridiculous.",1.0

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the input is a line from a character named chandler, likely from a tv show or movie script.
2. the phrase ""the british are coming?"" is a reference to the famous historical warning attributed to paul revere.
3. the use of this historical phrase in a modern context, phrased as a question, suggests a sarcastic or humorous intent.
4. chandler is known as a sarcastic character in the tv show ""friends,"" which further supports this interpretation.

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the rapid shift in emotional tone from extreme enthusiasm (""oh my god i love that!"") to sudden negation (""no!"") is a classic indicator of sarcasm. this abrupt reversal, combined with the questioning ""really?"" in between, strongly suggests that monica is using sarcasm to express her actual disapproval or dislike of something, despite initially claiming to love it. this kind of exaggerated, contradictory response is a hallmark of sarcastic communication.",1.0

2. hyperbole: the use of exaggeration (""where are all the men?"") is a common sarcastic technique.

3. irony: a man asking where all the men are creates an ironic situation, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

4. tone: the exclamation ""oh my god"" combined with the question suggests a dramatic, overblown reaction, which is typical of sarcastic delivery.

this text is clearly sarcastic. chandler's statement is filled with irony and exaggeration, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. here's why:

1. he starts by denying that he's freaking out, but then immediately repeats ""freaking out"" twice, which contradicts his denial.

2. the situation he describes (a woman named hildy calling to say they will get married) is highly unusual and not something that ""happens everyday"" as he claims.

3. the exaggerated claim that such an occurrence is commonplace is a clear use of sarcasm to mask his actual anxiety about the situation.

4. the name ""hildy"" is somewhat uncommon, adding to the absurdity of the situation and enhancing the sarcastic tone.

5. this type of dialogue is typical of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.

 RACHEL: No, it won't be her real birthday.

this response is labeled as ""sarcastic"" based on several key factors:

1. language style: the use of ""gee"" as an interjection is often associated with sarcastic or insincere expressions.

2. content: the statement expresses a wish for an impossible situation (someone being one year old and not knowing what a birthday is), which is a common structure for sarcastic comments.

3. the use of ""still"" in the question suggests a subtle criticism or mockery of the duration of the nap.
4. chandler, as a character from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor, which adds context to interpreting this line as sarcastic.

while the sentence appears to be a simple question on the surface, the context and subtle implications point towards a sarcastic intent rather than a genuine inquiry about someone's nap enjoyment.",1.0

the input text exhibits clear sarcastic elements, particularly in the last sentence. while the first part of chandler's statement is straightforward and expresses genuine concern about a work-related decision, the last sentence introduces a sarcastic twist that is characteristic of chandler's humor.

the phrase ""and that's something they should learn on their own"" is the key indicator of sarcasm. chandler is implying that his bosses will eventually realize he's an idiot without his help, which is a self-deprecating joke and not meant to be taken literally. this creates a contrast between the serious tone of the first part and the humorous, sarcastic tone of the last part.

the emotional contrast between professional concern and self-preservation, as well as the mix of seriousness and humor, further supports the sarcastic nature of the statement. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0

2. the exclamation point at the end adds emphasis to the sarcastic tone.

3. the context of discussing characters with names like ""ernie"" (likely referring to sesame street characters bert and ernie) in a seemingly coincidental situation further supports the sarcastic nature of the comment.

4. the character name ""chandler"" is indicative of the tv show ""friends,"" where the character chandler bing is known for his sarcastic humor.
