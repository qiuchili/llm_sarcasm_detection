#NOT GONNA WIN http://t.co/Mc9ebqjAqj,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

### label: sarcastic

the phrase ""not gonna win"" in all caps, followed by a link, strongly suggests sarcasm. the use of capitalization adds emphasis and intensity to the statement, which is often a marker of sarcastic tone in text-based communication. the phrase itself, as noted in the cues, expresses frustration or pessimism, but the exaggerated presentation implies that the author is likely using sarcasm to comment on a situation they find ridiculous or futile. the inclusion of a link further suggests that the tweet is referencing something specific, potentially for humorous or critical effect, which is common in sarcastic social media posts.",1.0

"People complain about my backround pic and all I feel is like ""hey don't blame me, Albert E might have spoken those words"" #sarcasm #life",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text for the following reasons:

1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates the sarcastic nature of the post.

2. the content of the text itself displays a sarcastic tone. the author is pretending to defend their choice of background picture with a quote that may not be authentic, which is a common form of sarcasm.

4. the overall tone of the text is playful and not meant to be taken seriously, which is characteristic of sarcastic comments.

therefore, based on these observations and the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag, i can confidently label this text as ""sarcastic"".",1.0

"@LaurenBailes I think the general rule is, if it's open all night, pull an all-nighter.",0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""i think the general rule is, if it's open all night, pull an all-nighter"" is likely sarcastic. it's presenting an exaggerated and unreasonable ""rule"" as if it were sensible advice. the humor comes from the absurdity of suggesting that the mere existence of a 24-hour establishment is reason enough to stay up all night, regardless of need or consequence. this playfully mocks the idea of pulling all-nighters, which are often associated with last-minute cramming or poor time management, by suggesting they should be done simply because the opportunity exists. the tone and the deliberate misapplication of logic indicate sarcasm.",1.0

@ChainAttackJay No sugar during christmas time? :(,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

1. emotional contrast: it juxtaposes the typically joyful ""christmas time"" with the restrictive ""no sugar,"" creating an unexpected and ironic pairing.

2. use of emoticon: the sad face "":("" at the end emphasizes the speaker's disappointment, which is likely exaggerated for effect.

3. rhetorical question format: the use of a question ""no sugar during christmas time?"" implies disbelief or criticism of the idea, rather than a genuine inquiry.

4. context: christmas is often associated with indulgence in sweets and treats, so the idea of no sugar during this time is contrary to typical expectations, likely meant to be taken humorously or ironically.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their feelings about the idea of restricting sugar intake during a traditionally indulgent holiday period.",1.0

About as relevant as Michael Sam and Jason Collins. RT @eonline: Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott comes out as gay.,0,"given the context and the nature of the tweet, i believe i can confidently label this text:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the tweet appears to be sarcastic in its comparison of dale scott's coming out to michael sam and jason collins. the phrase ""about as relevant as"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is not actually relevant or important. by equating dale scott's announcement to those of michael sam and jason collins, the author seems to be dismissively suggesting that this news is not significant or worthy of attention. the use of ""rt"" (retweet) with the news headline further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, as if the author is sharing the news only to mock its importance.",1.0
Getting Final Jeopardy correct on Kids Jeopardy boosts my self-esteem,0,"sarcastic

the statement ""getting final jeopardy correct on kids jeopardy boosts my self-esteem"" is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the speaker is presumably an adult, as they're making a self-reflective comment about their self-esteem.

2. kids jeopardy is designed for children, not adults. an adult finding self-esteem from succeeding at a children's version of a game show implies a sense of irony or self-deprecation.

3. the juxtaposition of a relatively minor accomplishment (answering a question on a kids' version of a game show) with something as significant as boosting one's self-esteem creates a humorous contrast that's typical of sarcasm.

4. the statement plays on the common understanding that adults generally shouldn't need validation from children's activities to feel good about themselves, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

therefore, the statement is most likely meant to be humorous and self-deprecating, indicating sarcasm rather than a genuine sentiment.",1.0
itsfunny bc people think im quiet|but im just listening toeveryones convos|and figuring out ur weaknesses|todestroy u later in life #sarcasm,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the presence of the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end of the text explicitly indicates that the message is meant to be sarcastic.

2. the content of the message itself is exaggerated and presents a humorous, albeit dark, scenario that's not meant to be taken literally.

3. the combination of seemingly innocent behavior (being quiet and listening) with an unexpected sinister motive (figuring out weaknesses to destroy people later) creates a contrast typical of sarcastic humor.

4. the abbreviated and informal writing style (e.g., ""bc"", ""im"", ""ur"") is often associated with casual, potentially sarcastic social media posts.

5. the emotional words extracted, particularly the contrast between ""quiet"" and ""destroy,"" support the sarcastic tone of the message.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this text.",1.0

I reckon straight women fancy victoria secret models more than straight men do #victoriasecret #irony,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label.

label: sarcastic

the tweet contains several elements that strongly suggest sarcasm:

1. the use of ""#irony"" as a hashtag is a direct indicator that the author intends the statement to be understood as ironic or sarcastic.

2. the statement presents a paradoxical idea: that straight women are more attracted to victoria's secret models than straight men. this contradicts the typical assumption about sexual attraction and the target audience for lingerie models.

3. the word ""fancy"" is used in a way that playfully addresses attraction, adding to the humorous tone.

4. the structure of the tweet, starting with ""i reckon,"" sets up an opinion that is then subverted, which is a common sarcastic technique.

the combination of these elements, along with the explicit mention of irony, strongly indicates that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic, poking fun at societal expectations and the marketing of lingerie.",1.0

1. the use of the hashtag #irony explicitly indicates the author's intention to point out a contradictory or unexpected situation.

2. the content of the tweet highlights a seeming contradiction: protesters are chanting against fox news despite fox news reportedly agreeing with their stance on the eric garner case.

3. the juxtaposition of the protesters' aggressive chant (""f*ck fox news"") with the information that fox actually agrees with them creates a situation that's meant to be perceived as ironic or absurd.

4. the tweet's structure, presenting this contradiction in a concise format typical of sarcastic observations on social media, further supports the sarcastic tone.

given these elements, the tweet is using sarcasm to comment on the perceived irony of the situation, making ""sarcastic"" the appropriate label for this input.",1.0

One of my favorite things to do is to make people wonder...it was completely unintentional but buying Bogs mud boots in a dress will do it,0,"based on the input and the provided context, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation: the text exhibits sarcastic humor by juxtaposing the idea of wearing mud boots (bogs) with a dress, which is an unusual combination. the speaker mentions that they enjoy making people wonder, and this unexpected pairing of formal and utilitarian footwear achieves that goal, even if unintentionally. the contrast between the practical, outdoor-oriented mud boots and the more formal attire (a dress) creates a humorous and somewhat absurd image, which is characteristic of sarcastic commentary on social expectations or norms.",1.0

2. self-awareness: the ""oops......."" suggests a mock realization of addiction, which is a common sarcastic device.

3. explicit mention of sarcasm: the hashtag #sarcasm is a direct indicator that the tweet is meant to be taken sarcastically.

4. excessive capitalization and punctuation: this is often used to convey an exaggerated or mocking tone in text-based communication.

5. encouragement to follow for more sarcasm: promoting a twitter account known for sarcastic content further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

Incidentally the foreword for movie #BhopalAPrayerForRain is by Subroto Roy Sahara - saying - justice delayed is justice denied. #Irony,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear markers of sarcasm, particularly through the use of irony. the ""#irony"" hashtag at the end is a direct indicator that the author intends the statement to be understood as sarcastic. 

the sarcasm stems from the apparent contradiction between subroto roy sahara's statement ""justice delayed is justice denied"" in the foreword of a movie about the bhopal disaster, and the implied suggestion that sahara himself may have been involved in situations where justice was delayed or denied.

the use of ""incidentally"" at the beginning also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it suggests a feigned casualness about what is actually a pointed observation.

this juxtaposition of a serious statement about justice with the implied irony of its source creates the sarcastic effect, making the label ""sarcastic"" the most appropriate choice for this text.",1.0
@RadiNabulsi Our 3 losses followed bye weeks & an FCS team. Do we get rid of those next year? #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

1. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet explicitly signals the author's sarcastic intent.

2. the question ""do we get rid of those next year?"" is not meant to be taken literally. the author is using irony to criticize georgia's football schedule.

3. the tweet implies that georgia's losses are somehow related to having bye weeks or playing against weaker fcs teams, which is an exaggerated and unrealistic suggestion, further indicating sarcasm.

4. the overall tone of the tweet is critical and mocking of the team's performance and scheduling, using humor to make this point.

given these clear indicators, especially the explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag, we can confidently label this tweet as ""sarcastic"".",1.0

2. there are no indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.

4. the hashtag #asksuperwomanlive suggests this is part of a legitimate q&a event where fans ask various questions, including hypothetical or imaginative ones.

Testing water temperatures #excitingtimes #Not,1,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the information provided. the text ""testing water temperatures"" on its own is a neutral statement about a mundane task. however, the addition of the hashtags ""#excitingtimes"" and especially ""#not"" strongly indicate sarcasm. 

the use of ""#excitingtimes"" is likely meant ironically, as testing water temperatures is generally not considered an exciting activity. the ""#not"" at the end serves to explicitly negate the idea that this is exciting, confirming the sarcastic intent.

this combination of a boring activity described with faux excitement and then explicitly negated is a classic sarcastic structure, making ""sarcastic"" the appropriate label for this text.",1.0

the input text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of the hashtag #irony, which explicitly signals the author's intent to be ironic or sarcastic.

2. the hashtag #stormageddon, which humorously exaggerates the severity of the storm by comparing it to armageddon.

4. the tone of mild amusement and surprise at the unexpected outcome further supports the sarcastic nature of the statement.

sarcastic

the phrase ""take me tooooo church"" on its own might seem like a sincere request or reference to the popular song. however, the elongated ""tooooo"" adds a sense of exaggeration, and the immediate contradiction with ""#not"" clearly indicates that the statement is meant sarcastically. the ""#not"" is a common way to denote sarcasm in text, especially on social media, by explicitly negating the preceding statement. this creates a clear contrast between the apparent desire expressed and its immediate rejection, which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.",1.0

sarcastic

the text contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the use of quotation marks around 'republican move' and 'effectively rob the royals' suggests skepticism or mockery of these claims.

2. the juxtaposition of the idea of royals being ""robbed"" with kate spending an extravagant amount (£32,000) on a single meal highlights the irony of the situation.

#obama @DemocratWire announce special urgent package for #Pakistan .. supported by @GOP to enhance their fight against obscurantists. #NOT,1,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the ""#not"" at the end of the tweet is a strong indicator of sarcasm. in social media, especially twitter, adding ""#not"" at the end of a statement is a common way to indicate that the preceding statement should be interpreted sarcastically or as the opposite of what was literally stated. 

the content of the tweet appears to be announcing a bipartisan effort to support pakistan in fighting against obscurantists (those opposed to enlightenment or progress). however, the ""#not"" at the end suggests that the author doesn't actually believe this is happening or is mocking the idea of such cooperation.

the use of this hashtag transforms what would otherwise be a straightforward political announcement into a sarcastic commentary, likely criticizing the lack of such cooperation or expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of such efforts.",1.0

sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. it presents a paradoxical statement, describing someone as both ""interesting"" and ""boring,"" which is inherently contradictory.

2. the repetition of ""so"" in ""so, so, so boring"" emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

3. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the statement is meant to be ironic or sarcastic.

4. the additional hashtag ""#what"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone, expressing mock confusion or disbelief.

5. the question format ""how is it possible"" is often used rhetorically in sarcastic statements to highlight an apparent contradiction.

these elements collectively create a clear sarcastic message, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate for this text.",1.0
"@Pier1984_ Not going this time, we might have a chance! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..... #fuckthat",0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""we might have a chance!"" is likely meant ironically, especially when followed by the expression of skepticism.

2. the use of the proverb ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..."" implies the speaker has been disappointed before and is expressing cynicism about repeating the experience.

3. the hashtag ""#fuckthat"" at the end emphasizes strong disapproval or rejection, which contrasts with the initial seemingly positive statement, further reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

4. the overall structure of starting with a seemingly positive statement and then immediately undercutting it with expressions of skepticism and frustration is a common sarcastic technique.

these elements, combined with the skeptical and negative tone noted in the cues, strongly support classifying this text as sarcastic.",1.0

sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic, as indicated by several factors:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to denote sarcasm on social media.
2. the absurd claim about ""racist dna"" and sarcastically calling someone a geneticist.
3. the overall tone of the message, which mocks the idea of attributing racism to genetic factors or skin color.

label: sarcastic

the tweet is clearly sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" directly signals the sarcastic intent of the message.

2. the contrast between crossfit (associated with fitness and health) and pizza (often associated with indulgence) creates a situational irony that forms the basis of the sarcasm.

3. the phrase ""so there used to be a crossfit place here..."" followed by ""#pizzawins"" implies a humorous commentary on the replacement of a fitness-oriented business with what is presumably a pizza place, which is the opposite of what one might expect in terms of health trends.

the combination of these elements, especially the explicit use of ""#irony,"" makes it clear that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the text appears to be a sincere statement expressing genuine concern and frustration. the author is earnestly defending their position and clarifying that their concern for their country does not equate to racism. the use of capitalization in ""not"" and the exclamation marks emphasize the speaker's emotional investment in this statement. while the topic is sensitive and potentially controversial, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the text. the hashtag #terrorists is likely used to contextualize the discussion rather than to convey sarcasm. overall, this seems to be a straightforward, albeit emotional, expression of the author's views.",0.0

1. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet strongly suggests sarcastic intent.

2. the comment ""i hope you weren't driving when you took that picture"" followed by ""#irony"" implies that the author believes the star phoenix (or whoever took the picture) was likely driving while taking the photo, which would be ironic for a news outlet potentially reporting on traffic or driving safety.

3. the contrast between the seemingly concerned statement (""i hope you weren't driving"") and the implication that they probably were driving creates the sarcastic tone.

4. the cues mention that there's a hint of sarcasm or criticism about potentially unsafe behavior, which aligns with this interpretation.

4. context: working wednesday to sunday is often considered less desirable than a standard monday to friday schedule, which adds to the sarcastic undertone of ""#yay"".

the use of these contrasting elements - positive and negative words, emojis, and hashtags - in such a short message is a strong indicator of sarcastic intent. the speaker is expressing dissatisfaction with their work schedule while sarcastically noting the financial upside.",1.0

   - feeling sick and bad (negative) vs. appreciation for cells (positive)
   - sickness (negative) vs. cells fighting hard (positive)

2. the use of exaggerated positivity in a negative situation (being sick) is another common sarcastic technique.

3. the hashtags provide strong evidence of sarcastic intent:
   - #blessed and #appreciative seem overly positive given the context of being sick
   - #sarcasm explicitly labels the post as sarcastic
   - #kinda adds a layer of ambiguity that is often present in sarcastic statements

4. the personification of cells ""fighting hard for you"" in a somewhat melodramatic way adds to the sarcastic tone.

given these factors, especially the explicit #sarcasm tag, it's clear that the author is using sarcasm to humorously comment on the experience of being sick.",1.0

Two years later & gingerbread house making still makes me cry.,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation: the text appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the exaggerated emotional response: crying over making a gingerbread house is an unexpectedly strong reaction to a typically fun, holiday activity.

2. the time frame mentioned: ""two years later"" suggests this is an ongoing issue, which adds to the hyperbolic nature of the statement.

4. the casual tone: the use of ""&"" and the matter-of-fact way of stating something seemingly absurd adds to the sarcastic tone.

while the emotional word ""cry"" is indeed negative, in this context it's likely used sarcastically to emphasize frustration or difficulty with a seemingly simple task, rather than literal crying. the overall effect is one of self-deprecating humor or playful exaggeration, which are common forms of sarcasm.",1.0

4. the use of hashtags like ""#sad"" at the end further reinforces the sarcastic tone, mimicking a style often used in social media to express mock disappointment.

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the following analysis:

1. the exaggerated enthusiasm in ""take a look at those calves!!!"" followed by multiple laughing emojis suggests an over-the-top, insincere tone.

2. the statement ""ladies love the calves!"" is likely an exaggeration or false assertion, especially when considered alongside the hashtags.

1. the phrase ""only a true nightshift person would understand this"" is often used sarcastically to mock exclusivity or insider knowledge.

2. the use of hashtags like #hardcore and #teamwork, followed by #not, suggests a sarcastic tone. the #not hashtag is particularly indicative of sarcasm, as it's often used to negate or contradict the preceding statements.

"My dad's still gonna get me santa's gifts since it's my last year before 18, but I really don't know what to ask for... #irony",1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the tweet exhibits sarcasm through the juxtaposition of two conflicting ideas:

1. the notion of still receiving ""santa's gifts"" at an age just before turning 18.
2. the use of the hashtag #irony, explicitly signaling the sarcastic intent.

the sarcasm stems from the fact that by the age of 17, most individuals have long stopped believing in santa claus. the tweet humorously plays on the idea of maintaining this childhood belief right up until legal adulthood, which is clearly not meant to be taken literally. the addition of the irony hashtag further confirms the sarcastic tone of the message.",1.0

2. the contradiction between the statement ""it didnt suck at all"" and the hashtag ""#notworthit"". this contrast highlights the sarcastic nature of the comment.

3. the phrase ""remember that one time"" sets up an expectation of a positive memory, but it's followed by a difficult situation (working two jobs while sick), creating irony.

4. common sense suggests that working multiple jobs while sick would be unpleasant, so claiming it ""didnt suck at all"" is likely to be sarcastic.

5. the use of ""..."" after the main statement adds a pause for effect, often used in sarcastic delivery.

given these clear indicators, especially the explicit sarcasm hashtag, we can confidently label this text as ""sarcastic"".",1.0

2. the phrasing ""i wonder what % of that 43%"" is a rhetorical device often used in sarcastic comments to cast doubt on a claim or statistic.

3. the comment highlights the potential confusion or lack of consensus around the term ""private cloud,"" which is a common point of criticism in tech discussions and often approached with sarcasm.

4. the brevity and informal tone of the tweet, combined with the questioning of an apparently precise statistic (43%), suggests a sarcastic undertone.

"Here we go again, thanks to all that claim to cover WVHS hoop #NOT|Highlanders beat Parkersburg 76-75 on last second shot by @alexia_paige13",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text is clearly sarcastic. the author starts with ""here we go again"" and uses ""#not"" to express frustration or disappointment with those who claim to cover wvhs basketball but apparently didn't report on this significant win. the sarcasm is directed at the lack of coverage for what seems to be an exciting, close game with a last-second winning shot. the author then proceeds to provide the information about the game themselves, implying that they had to do so because others who should have covered it didn't. the use of ""#not"" is a common indicator of sarcasm in social media posts.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of the phrase ""gotta love"" combined with the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is expressing disapproval of racially-based awards through irony, saying they love something while actually meaning the opposite. the hashtag ""#not"" serves to explicitly mark the statement as sarcastic for those who might otherwise misinterpret it.",1.0
"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul, and makes us reach for more...💖",0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

the quote appears to be a genuine, heartfelt statement about love. the use of poetic language to describe love's effects on the soul and personal growth, combined with the heart emoji, strongly suggests this is a sincere expression of sentiment rather than a sarcastic comment. the content and tone are consistent with earnest reflections on the positive aspects of love, without any indicators of irony or sarcasm.",0.0
clashupdate #not http://t.co/1bFOsIwnI5,1,"based on the limited information provided in the input text and the current cues, i cannot confidently determine whether this text is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the text is very brief and lacks context, making it difficult to assess any sarcastic intent.

however, if i must choose a label, i would lean towards:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward update notification, possibly for a game or application called ""clash.""
2. the hashtag ""#not"" could be interpreted in various ways and doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.
3. the presence of a url suggests this is likely an informative post rather than a sarcastic comment.

without more context or the content behind the url, it's challenging to definitively determine sarcastic intent. the label ""not sarcastic"" is chosen based on the apparent informative nature of the post, but this classification comes with low confidence due to the limited information available.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the tweet expresses sympathy for henry's situation with the comment ""aw henry oppa >^<"". this appears to be a genuine expression of concern from a fan, using a cute emoticon and the respectful korean term ""oppa"" (used by females to address older male friends or celebrities). the tone doesn't suggest any sarcasm, but rather sincere empathy for henry's request to be allowed to sleep without disturbance from overzealous fans.",0.0

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic intent by pointing out the irony of using the term ""left regressives"" while implicitly criticizing the use of labels. the hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet explicitly signals the sarcastic tone, reinforcing the author's intent to highlight the contradiction in using a label while presumably criticizing others for labeling.",1.0

A #celebrity is a person who is known for his well-knownness. #fact #TeamFollowBack #irony,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. several elements point to this:

1. the definition provided is circular and nonsensical (""known for his well-knownness""), which is a common sarcastic technique to mock the concept being defined.

2. the use of the hashtag #fact alongside this clearly non-factual definition adds to the ironic tone.

3. the explicit use of the #irony hashtag is a direct signal that the statement is meant sarcastically.

4. the combination of #celebrity with #teamfollowback seems to be mocking the idea of social media fame and follower-chasing as a path to celebrity.

the use of ""#sarcasm"" in the tweet is a clear indicator that the message is intended to be sarcastic. the author is using irony to criticize jeremy hunt's stance or actions regarding the publication of a&e figures over the holiday period. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly signals the sarcastic intent, making this classification straightforward.",1.0

2. the suggestion of ""cool applications"" for an imaginary string further emphasizes the absurdist humor.
3. the hashtag ""#whatamidoing"" is self-deprecating, indicating the author is aware of the silliness of their statement.

these factors combine to create a lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek tone that is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the tweet exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""bitches be like"" is often a setup for a sarcastic or ironic statement.
2. the hashtags ""#more #appointments #please"" seem to contradict the typical attitude towards medical appointments, suggesting irony.
3. ""#not#crazy#enough .... yet"" implies a self-aware exaggeration, a common sarcastic device.
4. the context of being at an orthodontist adds to the sarcastic tone, as dental appointments are rarely something people eagerly seek more of.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that the tweet is meant to be read sarcastically, likely expressing frustration or irony about needing multiple orthodontic appointments while humorously denying being ""crazy"" for it.",1.0

"@Boeing, @SpaceX told to stop work under crew contracts #irony http://t.co/1Hyb70IATA",1,"based on the information provided, i'll assign a label to the input text:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tweet uses the hashtag #irony, which is a strong indicator that the author intends the message to be read as sarcastic.

2. the content of the tweet appears to be factual information about nasa instructing boeing and spacex to halt work on crew contracts. however, the use of #irony suggests that the author finds something contradictory or unexpected about this situation.

3. the sarcasm likely stems from the irony of nasa, an organization focused on space exploration and progress, telling these companies to stop work on projects that would advance space travel capabilities.

4. the brevity and matter-of-fact tone of the tweet, combined with the irony hashtag, creates a sarcastic undertone that implies criticism or amusement at the situation.

therefore, considering the use of the #irony hashtag and the context of the situation described, this tweet can be classified as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

1. it uses exaggeration and hyperbole (""that sad moment"") to describe a relatively mundane realization about growing up.

2. the phrase ""i wanna move back in"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used ironically to emphasize the speaker's nostalgic feelings.

3. the juxtaposition of adult realization with childish desire creates a humorous contrast typical of sarcastic statements.

4. the overall tone combines wistfulness with self-deprecating humor, a common sarcastic approach.

this statement is sarcastic because it humorously points out the irony in a situation where a simple request for a quick prayer (""make dua for me bro"") unexpectedly turns into a lengthy, hour-long conversation. the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the intended brevity of the request and the actual prolonged outcome, which is likely not what the person asking for the prayer initially had in mind.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of the hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author intends this message to be understood as sarcastic. the tweet lists several negative attributes and actions, seemingly criticizing a public figure, but the #irony tag suggests that the real target of criticism is likely someone who has accused others of these very behaviors while potentially being guilty of them themselves. this ironic twist is a hallmark of sarcastic commentary.",1.0

"@clairebag8 yeah amazing night, I think he out till the death! I'll let u know xx",0,"label: sarcastic

this text appears to be sarcastic. while the phrase ""amazing night"" seems positive on the surface, the follow-up comment ""i think he out till the death"" introduces an exaggerated, hyperbolic element that suggests sarcasm.

the use of ""till the death"" to describe staying out late is an over-the-top way of emphasizing how long or intense the night was. this kind of hyperbole is often a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

additionally, the casual tone and use of abbreviations (""u"" for ""you"") and ""xx"" for kisses at the end contrast with the dramatic ""till the death"" phrase, further highlighting the likely sarcastic intent.

the overall message seems to be conveying that while the night might have been fun, it was perhaps excessively long or wild, to the point where the speaker is using sarcasm to comment on its intensity.",1.0

2. the hashtag ""#not ayoba"" explicitly states that long-distance relationships are not good or cool (as ""ayoba"" means ""cool"" or ""great"" in south african slang).

3. the combination of seemingly positive phrasing (""serious sh*t"") with the contradictory negative hashtag is a common sarcastic structure.

4. the ellipsis (...) at the end often implies an unspoken, sarcastic tone in text communications.

2. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end of the statement indicates the speaker finds something amusing about their own comment.

3. the context of commenting on someone's appearance or style with a made-up term like ""the wet look"" has a playful, teasing tone that's characteristic of sarcasm.

4. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""i thought it was,"" implies a contrast between what the speaker thought and what might actually be the case, which is a common sarcastic technique.

5. in social media contexts, such lighthearted, slightly mocking comments are often used sarcastically to engage in friendly banter or to make a humorous observation.

Literally functioning on 4 hours of sleep and I feel great 😄 !! #Not #CollegeisKillingMe #OneMoreWeek,1,"based on the input text and the context provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
this tweet exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""literally functioning on 4 hours of sleep and i feel great 😄 !!"" is likely not meant to be taken at face value. most people would not actually feel great on such little sleep.

2. the smiling emoji (😄) is used ironically here, contrasting with the negative situation being described.

3. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#collegeiskillingme"" further reinforce the sarcastic tone. ""#not"" is a common way to indicate that the opposite of what was just said is true, while ""#collegeiskillingme"" expresses the actual negative sentiment about the lack of sleep.

4. the context of sleep deprivation in college life supports the interpretation that this is a sarcastic comment about the difficulties of maintaining a healthy sleep schedule in college.

therefore, the tweet is using sarcasm to express frustration about lack of sleep and the challenges of college life, rather than genuinely claiming to feel great on little sleep.",1.0

#HowToGetUnfollowed Post pictures or videos of you smoking. Especially blowing smoke at the camera. #SoCool #Not #GTFO,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the hashtag ""#howtogetunfollowed"" is ironic, as it's presenting behavior that would lead to losing followers as if it were advice.

2. the phrase ""especially blowing smoke at the camera"" emphasizes a specific behavior in a way that implies criticism rather than genuine endorsement.

3. the use of ""#socool"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure, where something is stated and then immediately contradicted for effect.

4. the final hashtag ""#gtfo"" (get the f*** out) expresses strong disapproval, reinforcing that the previous statements were not meant sincerely.

these elements, combined with the context provided in the cues, strongly indicate that the text is intended to be sarcastic, mocking people who post such content thinking it's cool or attractive.",1.0

has anyone visualised the different colours and flavours of twitter streams? kinda lipmus test.,0,"not sarcastic

this query appears to be a genuine question about data visualization techniques for twitter content. the user is sincerely asking if anyone has created visual representations of twitter streams based on different characteristics (metaphorically referred to as ""colours and flavours""). the comparison to a litmus test (though misspelled as ""lipmus"") suggests they're interested in a quick, visual way to categorize or assess different types of twitter content. there's no indication of irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the language is straightforward and inquisitive, consistent with a sincere request for information.",0.0

So ill. It actually hurts to breathe. Still that nice long walk to the station did me the world of good #not,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicator is the use of ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to denote sarcasm on social media. the person describes feeling very ill and in pain, then sarcastically claims that a long walk to the station ""did me the world of good,"" immediately followed by ""#not"" to signal that the opposite is true. this juxtaposition of stating something positive while actually meaning the opposite is a classic example of sarcasm.",1.0
@DarlaMiles7 then later he snuggles up to The Royals with giddy glee #Irony,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of the hashtag #irony, combined with the description of contradictory behavior and the exaggerated language like ""snuggles up"" and ""giddy glee,"" strongly indicate that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic. the author is pointing out the irony in someone's inconsistent behavior towards the royals, using words that convey excitement but in a context that suggests criticism and mockery.",1.0
"Blue skies, warm air, and the royal accommodation! #WhatMoreDoesOneNeed #Education? #Not... http://t.co/mEtHUIaAtR http://t.co/CsW0rfhGZZ",1,"sarcastic

the input text appears to be sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. contrast: there's a stark contrast between the idyllic situation described (pleasant weather, luxurious accommodation) and the sudden mention of education, which seems out of place.

2. hashtag usage: the hashtags ""#whatmoredoesoneneed"" followed immediately by ""#education? #not..."" create a sarcastic tone. it implies that education is unnecessary when one has comfort and luxury, which is likely not the author's true belief.

3. implied criticism: the tweet seems to be criticizing the idea that comfortable surroundings are more important than education, using sarcasm to make this point.

4. tone shift: the text starts with a positive description but ends with a dismissive tone towards education, indicating sarcasm.

5. context implication: the tweet suggests the author is enjoying leisure time instead of studying, but the way it's presented implies a sarcastic commentary on prioritizing comfort over education.

given these cues, the text is most likely meant to be read as sarcastic, poking fun at the idea of valuing luxury over education.",1.0

@TheLuluLife I take it you're not in England then ; ),0,"given the current cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of the winking emoticon ""; )"" at the end of the message is a strong indicator of sarcasm or playful teasing.

2. the phrase ""i take it you're not in england then"" is likely a rhetorical statement or an obvious observation made in a lighthearted way, rather than a genuine question.

3. the combination of the seemingly obvious statement with the winking emoticon suggests the speaker is making a joke or being playfully sarcastic about the other person's location.

4. while the emotional content is subtle, the playful tone implied by the emoticon aligns well with sarcastic communication.

this message appears to be a friendly, sarcastic comment, possibly in response to something that made it clear the other person wasn't in england, hence the playful nature of pointing it out.",1.0

explanation: the message appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration and anger about a car breaking down. the strong language and negative hashtags (#died, #not-happy) indicate genuine upset rather than sarcastic intent. while sarcasm can sometimes involve exaggeration, in this case the emotion seems sincere and directly related to the inconvenience of a car failing. the message lacks the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm.",0.0

Lesson learnt? Herd of sheep who fought over TVs on #BlackFriday struggling to sell them http://t.co/OMXl5ZPOdY #irony #capitalism,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. it uses irony and metaphor to criticize consumer behavior during black friday sales. the key elements you've provided, such as the reference to a ""herd of sheep"" fighting over tvs and the hashtags #irony and #capitalism, strongly indicate a sarcastic tone. the text is mocking the impulse buying during sales events and the subsequent difficulty in reselling these items, highlighting the futility of such consumerist behavior. the phrase ""lesson learnt?"" at the beginning adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that people should have known better but acted foolishly anyway.",1.0
Tomorrow three test signature.|Thank you. |#school #sarcasm,1,"based on the given cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the presence of the hashtag #sarcasm in both the context information and the input text is a clear indicator of sarcastic intent.

2. the context mentions ""school-related"" content, which aligns with the input text mentioning ""test signature"" and the hashtag #school.

3. the phrase ""thank you"" at the end, given the context of having three test signatures tomorrow, likely carries a sarcastic tone. it's not typical to genuinely express gratitude for having multiple tests.

4. the structure of the sentence, stating a challenging situation (three test signatures) followed by ""thank you,"" is a common sarcastic format used to express dissatisfaction or frustration in a seemingly polite way.

therefore, considering all these factors, the text is clearly intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of a parent finding their child's behavior endearing. while there is a contrast between the cuteness of the child's actions and the fact that the friend is imaginary, this doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm. parents often find their children's imaginative play charming and developmentally appropriate, even when it involves interacting with imaginary entities. the tone of the statement seems straightforward and affectionate rather than sarcastic or mocking.",0.0

2. the use of ""#hibernot"" suggests a play on words, combining ""hibernate"" and ""not,"" which could be interpreted as a sarcastic take on not hibernating or staying active.
3. the juxtaposition of ""#hibernot"" and ""#not"" creates a contradictory message, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
4. the brevity and structure of the message, typical of a tweet, lends itself to a quick, witty, and potentially sarcastic comment.

@TorontoStar: NDP to introduce bill to make OHIP public #not appropriate # confidentiality,0,"based on the input tweet and the context provided, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the tweet is sarcastic because ohip (ontario health insurance plan) is already a public healthcare system in ontario, canada. the ndp (new democratic party) suggesting they will ""introduce a bill to make ohip public"" is redundant and nonsensical, as ohip is already a public program. 

the hashtags ""#not appropriate"" and ""#confidentiality"" further emphasize the sarcastic tone, implying that there's something inappropriate or confidential about making a public system public, which is absurd.

this tweet is likely mocking or criticizing either the ndp's policy proposals or media coverage of healthcare issues by presenting an illogical scenario as if it were a serious news item.",1.0

sarcastic

2. it then immediately contradicts this by criticizing the language use, implying that the person addressed is not behaving like a ""lady.""
3. the phrase ""but i guess you are not one"" is a sarcastic jab, insinuating that the person's behavior disqualifies them from being considered a ""lady.""

the contrast between the initial polite address and the subsequent criticism, along with the indirect insult at the end, are hallmarks of sarcastic speech. the speaker is not sincerely concerned about proper behavior but is using the concept of ""ladies"" ironically to deliver a pointed criticism.",1.0

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the exclamation ""sweet jeebus!"" at the beginning of the tweet is an exaggerated, informal expression typically used sarcastically to express mock surprise or amazement.

2. the content of the tweet is actually about serious weather conditions (very high to phenomenal seas), which contrasts with the casual, almost celebratory tone of ""sweet jeebus!""

3. the use of scientific satellite data (cryosat & jason-2) and technical terminology (""phenomenal seas"") in combination with the informal opening creates a juxtaposition that is often characteristic of sarcasm.

4. the tweet appears to be a retweet (mt = modified tweet) of more formal information from nwsopc (likely the national weather service ocean prediction center), with the sarcastic comment added at the beginning.

this combination of an exaggerated, casual expression with serious scientific information strongly suggests the tweet is meant to be read sarcastically, likely commenting on the extreme nature of the weather conditions in a humorous way.",1.0

3. the contrast between being ""hyper at 1am"" and knowing that one ""really should be getting rest"" implies a sense of irony, which is a common element in sarcastic statements.

4. the overall tone of the tweet suggests a light-hearted, self-aware commentary on the speaker's poor sleep habits, using humor and wordplay to convey this message sarcastically.",1.0

3. the context provided suggests that mark may frequently criticizes ohio state, so his opinion against the buckeyes is actually expected rather than shocking, further confirming the sarcastic nature of the statement.

"Google scholarship application kept crashing in Chrome. Opened it in IE, finished application without incident. #irony",1,"based on the input text and the provided context, i can confidently assign the label:

2. the phrase ""guess you could say i've got my life together"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is implying that setting an alarm for pm instead of am is not a sign of having one's life together, and is using sarcasm to highlight this.
3. the overall tone of the tweet, including the reference to ""mom and jesus"" at the end, adds to the sarcastic and self-deprecating nature of the message.

1. the user starts with ""it's 2015,"" implying that technology should be more advanced by this time.
2. the rhetorical question ""why am i still manually turning on/off wifi, bluetooth, nfc, etc..?"" expresses frustration and disappointment that these actions aren't automated.
3. the use of ""#fb"" (likely meaning ""facebook"") and ""yep"" at the end adds to the sarcastic tone, emphasizing the user's exasperation.

the sarcasm stems from the expectation that in 2015, such basic device functions should be automated, contrasting with the reality of still having to manually control them. this aligns with the cues mentioning the user's expectation for automation of these features by 2015.",1.0

#Johnny #Football #time #is #not #a #fun time #any #more: The Cleveland Browns went into Sunday's game against the... http://t.co/Vm4E3dKexF,0,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" based on the following analysis:

1. contrast between expectations and reality: the hashtag ""#johnny #football #time"" typically implies excitement and positive expectations, but it's immediately followed by ""#is #not #a #fun time #any #more,"" creating a stark contrast that's characteristic of sarcasm.

2. use of understatement: saying it's ""not a fun time"" to describe what appears to be significant struggles or disappointment is likely an understatement, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. context: johnny manziel (nicknamed ""johnny football"") was highly hyped when drafted by the cleveland browns, but his nfl career was marked by struggles and controversies. this tweet seems to be sarcastically commenting on the gap between the initial excitement and the disappointing reality.

4. tone: the use of hashtags to break up the sentence ""#is #not #a #fun time #any #more"" adds a mocking or exaggerated tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.

5. implied criticism: the tweet appears to be criticizing or mocking the performance or situation of johnny manziel and the cleveland browns, using sarcasm to express disappointment or frustration.

the input text displays clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the precise time ""08:01am on the dot"" combined with ""#not #sleepy"" suggests irony, as most people would indeed be sleepy at such an early hour.

2. the juxtaposition of ""#not #sleepy"" immediately followed by ""#tired"" creates a contradictory statement that is typical of sarcastic expressions.

3. the use of ""#helloworld"" in this context seems to be a sarcastic greeting to the day, especially when followed by ""#nothanks"", indicating reluctance to start the day.

4. the overall tone conveys frustration with having to wake up early, masked in a seemingly cheerful social media post format, which is a common sarcastic approach.

sarcastic

the text displays a clear contrast between the potentially positive aspect of having multiple games scheduled and the negative emotional response indicated by the crying emojis. this juxtaposition of scheduling many games (which might typically be seen as exciting for a player) with an expression of distress is a hallmark of sarcasm. the author is likely using the crying emojis to humorously or ironically express feeling overwhelmed by the busy schedule, rather than genuinely excited about it.",1.0
@FireInTheLyons Go you! #not Home until the 1st Jan. So excited!,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. in social media, particularly twitter, ""#not"" is commonly used to negate the sentiment expressed immediately before it.

2. the phrase ""so excited!"" at the end, when combined with the information that the person isn't going home until january 1st, appears to be sarcastic. most people would typically not be excited about being away from home for an extended period, especially during holiday times (assuming this is around the new year).

3. the exclamation ""go you!"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a sarcastic way of expressing the opposite sentiment, implying disapproval or lack of enthusiasm.

these elements together strongly suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to express frustration or disappointment about not being able to go home until january 1st, rather than genuine excitement.",1.0

2. the phrase ""boy, me and @kels_efollin are some winners"" is used ironically, especially when followed by the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#losers"".

3. the hashtag ""#senioritisisreal"" (likely meant to be #senioritisisreal) confirms the context of lacking motivation in their final year of studies.

4. the overall tone and use of irony throughout the text strongly indicates sarcasm.

The ones that caught me by surprise were the ones I didn't expect #duh #redundantredundant,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. the reasons for this judgment are:

2. the hashtags ""#duh"" and ""#redundantredundant"" are clear indicators of sarcasm. ""#duh"" is often used to point out something extremely obvious, while ""#redundantredundant"" is a playful way of acknowledging the repetitive nature of the statement.

3. the combination of the redundant statement with the self-aware hashtags creates a sarcastic tone, poking fun at the concept of surprises and the speaker's own statement.

this text is a classic example of using overstatement of the obvious for humorous effect, which is a common sarcastic technique.",1.0

the input text is clearly sarcastic. several elements point to this:

1. the use of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end of the tweet explicitly indicates the sarcastic intent.

2. the content itself is absurd, sarcastically implying that the gamergate movement was somehow responsible for an ebola campaign, which is obviously not true.

3. the rhetorical question ""how many people did we kill?"" is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to mock the idea of such a connection.

4. the context provided in the current cues supports this interpretation, noting that the tweet is using sarcasm to mock conspiracy theories or misinformation linking these unrelated events.

therefore, the correct label for this input is undoubtedly ""sarcastic.""",1.0

the reasoning behind this judgment is:

1. the phrase ""forest hills drive"" likely refers to j. cole's popular album ""2014 forest hills drive.""

2. the use of ""naw...."" at the end suggests a contradiction or reversal of the initial statement.

3. the ellipsis (....) after ""naw"" implies a trailing off, which can be indicative of sarcasm or irony.

4. the structure of the sentence sets up an expectation (having the album on a playlist) and then immediately contradicts it, which is a common sarcastic technique.

the tweet uses exaggeration and a mocking tone to criticize sony executives based on the leaked emails. the sarcasm is evident in the way it oversimplifies and harshly judges the executives, calling them ""ugly people, stupid & need to learn how to spell."" this hyperbolic language, combined with the hashtag #sonyhack, indicates that the author is using sarcasm to express their disapproval of the executives' behavior and competence as revealed by the leaked emails.",1.0
I wonder what triggered the anxiety? #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" based on the following reasons:

1. the use of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end of the statement is a clear and direct indicator that the speaker intends the comment to be interpreted as sarcastic.

2. the phrase ""i wonder"" is often used in sarcastic statements to express mock curiosity or to point out something obvious.

3. the question about what triggered anxiety, followed by the sarcasm hashtag, suggests that the speaker is not genuinely inquiring about the cause of anxiety, but rather implying that the cause should be obvious or known.

4. the juxtaposition of a seemingly sincere question with the sarcasm hashtag creates the ironic tone characteristic of sarcasm.

therefore, considering these elements and the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag, this statement is clearly intended to be sarcastic.",1.0
Love waking up to no heat in my apartment #not #socold,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of ""love"" at the beginning of the sentence is clearly sarcastic, as waking up to no heat in an apartment is not typically an enjoyable experience. this sarcasm is further reinforced by the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#socold"", which emphasize the speaker's displeasure with the situation in a sarcastic manner. the cues correctly identify these elements as indicators of sarcasm in this tweet-like message.",1.0
Nice weather for today.. #not 😠,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the tweet ""nice weather for today.. #not 😠"" clearly demonstrates sarcastic intent. the initial positive statement about the weather is immediately contradicted by the ""#not"" hashtag, which is a common way to indicate sarcasm. the angry face emoji (😠) further reinforces the negative sentiment and sarcastic tone. this aligns perfectly with the extracted context information, which identifies the negative sentiment, sarcastic nature, and angry mood of the tweet.",1.0
"Decided I'd go to bed ""early"" for once. I've been laying here since 2 am. Yet the total amount of sleep I've had all week is 10 hrs. #irony",1,"sarcastic

i believe this label is reliable based on the following reasoning:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""early"" suggests the author is being ironic about their intention to sleep early.

2. the contrast between going to bed ""early"" and still being awake at 2 am highlights the irony of the situation.

3. the author explicitly uses the hashtag #irony, which is a clear indicator that they are being sarcastic about the situation.

4. the frustration implied by the overall tone, especially mentioning the low total amount of sleep for the week, adds to the sarcastic nature of the comment.

5. the discrepancy between the intention (going to bed early) and the reality (not being able to sleep) is a classic setup for sarcasm.

therefore, this text can confidently be labeled as ""sarcastic"".",1.0

"@RandBallsStu @floyding I mean Zach is a teacher, amirite?",0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this text is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of ""amirite?"" (am i right?) at the end of the statement is often associated with sarcastic or humorous comments.
2. the context seems casual and potentially joking, rather than a serious statement about zach's profession.
3. without more context, the statement ""zach is a teacher"" could be meant ironically or as part of a running joke among the people in the conversation.
4. the informal tone and the way the statement is presented suggest that it might not be a straightforward fact, but rather a sarcastic comment or inside joke.

while the sarcasm is subtle, the combination of the casual tone, the use of ""amirite?"", and the lack of additional context points towards a sarcastic interpretation rather than a literal one.",1.0

3. there's no clear contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
4. the comment seems to be expressing genuine curiosity or anticipation about whether someone will read something, rather than making a sarcastic remark.
5. the overall tone appears to be light-hearted and casual, without any obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration or irony.

label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be expressing genuine excitement about an upcoming reunion or event involving a group or team (referred to as the ""ultimate squad""). the use of the word ""ultimate"" in a positive context, the countdown-like phrase ""less than a week,"" and the inclusion of social media handles and a link all suggest this is a sincere, enthusiastic message rather than a sarcastic one. the overall tone aligns with the cues indicating anticipation and excitement, supporting a non-sarcastic interpretation.",0.0

"Mike Smith and Brian Hoyer walk into a bar. They sit down and at the same time say ""I told you it wasn't all my fault"" #Coyotes #Browns",0,"sarcastic

the given text is likely intended to be sarcastic. here's why:

1. setup and punchline structure: the text uses a classic joke format (""x and y walk into a bar...""), which is often used for humorous or sarcastic statements.

2. simultaneous response: the fact that both mike smith and brian hoyer say the exact same thing at the same time is an exaggeration for comedic effect, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. content of the response: ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" implies that both players are deflecting blame for poor performance, which is being mocked through this sarcastic setup.

4. sports context: the hashtags #coyotes and #browns refer to two different sports teams (nhl and nfl respectively). this incongruity adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's lumping together two unrelated athletes in a shared moment of excuse-making.

5. implied criticism: the sarcasm serves to criticize both players for not taking full responsibility for their teams' performances.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that this tweet is meant to be read sarcastically, poking fun at both players and their tendency to deflect blame.",1.0

2. the phrase ""*scoffs humble pie*"" is an idiom that typically expresses sincere, albeit reluctant, admission of being wrong.
3. the overall tone seems to be one of humility and acknowledgment of a mistake, rather than sarcasm.
4. there are no clear indicators of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.

sarcastic

the use of ""#tbt"" (throwback thursday) alongside ""#not"" and the description of an ""evil cold november day"" that the author explicitly states they don't want to throwback to creates a sarcastic tone. this juxtaposition of the celebratory nature of typical throwback posts with an unpleasant memory is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1.0

2. this is immediately contrasted with ""...so why is my data being depleted using twitter?""
3. the use of ""#not impressed"" at the end further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

the author is using irony to express frustration about data usage while using a supposedly ""free"" service. the sarcasm is evident in the contrast between the claim of twitter being free and the reality of data depletion, as well as the explicit statement of not being impressed.",1.0
@KalobTaulien @twitter Yes on Auto-messagers No to #FollowBackers ... They make me money over on TSU. Thx your post||http://t.co/ALSThKb1pG,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text contains contrasting sentiments (""yes"" to one thing, ""no"" to another) which is often a feature of sarcastic statements.
2. the author's approval of auto-messagers, which are generally considered annoying by most social media users, seems counterintuitive and likely sarcastic.
3. the claim that auto-messagers ""make me money over on tsu"" appears to be an exaggeration or unlikely statement, which is characteristic of sarcasm.
4. the brief ""thx your post"" at the end feels abrupt and insincere, potentially indicating a sarcastic tone.
5. the overall structure and tone of the message, combining seemingly contradictory preferences with a claim about making money, suggests a mocking or sarcastic attitude towards certain social media practices.

therefore, considering these factors, i believe this text is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine expression of preferences and gratitude.",1.0

3. the historical reference in ""#soclosetilden"" (likely referring to the disputed 1876 us presidential election) and ""#1vote"" emphasize the dramatic and ironic nature of the situation.

4. the overall tone of frustration and disbelief expressed through the contrast between the speaker's self-proclaimed expertise and the unexpected outcome.

the statement employs irony to highlight the perceived absurdity of an anti-corruption crusader losing due to alleged corruption, making it a clear example of sarcasm.",1.0

the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically. the tweet appears to be mocking or criticizing a decision to spread positions with long feeder cattle, implying that this is actually a poor business move despite it being presented as a positive action.",1.0
It's all about Twitter #not a clue,0,"sarcastic

this text is very likely sarcastic. the statement ""it's all about twitter"" seems to be making a definitive claim about the importance or prevalence of twitter. however, this is immediately followed by the hashtag ""#not a clue"", which directly contradicts the confident tone of the first part.

this juxtaposition of a seemingly knowledgeable statement with an admission of complete ignorance is a classic sarcastic technique. the author is likely poking fun at the perceived importance of twitter or at people who claim to understand it fully, while simultaneously admitting (or pretending to admit) their own lack of understanding.

the use of hashtags for sarcastic effect is also common on social media platforms, further supporting the sarcastic interpretation of this text.",1.0
"@ban_postgate though, I suspect you don't actually care about the truth, so whatever, go troll someone else ;-)",0,"based on the input text and the provided context, i can confidently assign a label without needing further consideration:

label: sarcastic

1. the use of ""though"" at the beginning implies a dismissive tone.
2. the phrase ""i suspect you don't actually care about the truth"" is a sarcastic accusation.

@KaylaBattaglia thanks I thought it was tomorrow #not #iknow #notthepoint,1,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i believe i can provide a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

the text displays subtle sarcastic elements, particularly through the use of hashtags like ""#not"" and ""#iknow,"" which suggest a self-aware, ironic tone. the phrase ""thanks i thought it was tomorrow"" followed by these hashtags implies that the speaker didn't actually think it was tomorrow, but is using sarcasm to acknowledge a mistake or misunderstanding. the additional ""#notthepoint"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone, indicating that the speaker is aware of their error but is downplaying its significance. while the sarcasm is not overtly aggressive, the combination of these elements creates a mildly sarcastic response to the situation.",1.0

sarcastic

the comment ""tulisa has really made herself ugly #xfactor"" appears to be a sarcastic remark. the use of ""really"" in this context often indicates sarcasm, implying the opposite of what is literally stated. the comment is likely criticizing tulisa's appearance in a mocking way, rather than sincerely stating that she has made herself ugly. the hashtag #xfactor further contextualizes this as a commentary on her appearance during the show, aligning with the brief topic information provided. the sarcastic tone is typical of social media commentary on celebrity appearances, especially in the context of popular tv shows like x factor.",1.0

sarcastic

"Murdered baby, black man in US, kids in Thailand and a woman's body in Avon gorge. It's a jolly day for news today #sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. the reasons for this judgment are:

1. clear contrast: the text presents a series of tragic news items (murders and deaths) but describes it as ""a jolly day for news,"" which is an obvious mismatch.

2. tone discrepancy: the use of ""jolly"" to describe a day filled with such grim news is clearly inappropriate and indicates sarcastic intent.

3. explicit sarcasm marker: the text ends with ""#sarcasm"", which is a direct indication from the author that the statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically.

4. dark humor: the juxtaposition of tragic events with cheerful language is a common form of dark, sarcastic humor used to highlight the absurdity or awfulness of a situation.

given these strong indicators, particularly the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag, there's no doubt that this text is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

2. the use of ""yuk .. so naff"" expresses disgust and disapproval, which contrasts with the idea of christmas magic.

3. the overall tone is mocking and critical of the christmas decorations being described, particularly the fact that they're ""pulled by white van man"".

these elements strongly indicate that the tweet is meant to be sarcastic, criticizing what the author sees as a tacky or low-quality christmas display.",1.0

2. thanking ""forrest"" (likely a sports team) for causing the loss of a bet is obviously not sincere.

1. the person is playfully appealing to snow as if it could respond to their request.
2. they're hoping for an external, unlikely event (snowfall) to get them out of a commitment.
3. the tone suggests a lighthearted wish rather than a serious expectation.

### label:
sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of the hashtag #irony strongly suggests the tweet is meant to be ironic or sarcastic.

2. the philosophical nature of the question ""how can u miss something u never had?"" is often used in sarcastic or ironic contexts to point out a contradiction or absurdity.

3. the combination of #randomthoughts with this question further implies a sardonic or wry observation rather than a genuine inquiry.

4. the informal language (use of ""u"" instead of ""you"") is common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the inclusion of #miss alongside the ironic question reinforces the sarcastic tone, as it's playing on the concept of missing something impossible.

while the content of the linked image isn't available, the overall context and use of language strongly indicate that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic rather than a sincere philosophical question.",1.0

4. the overall structure of the tweet, presenting mahathir's conflicting stances side by side, is designed to emphasize the irony and invoke a sarcastic interpretation.

### explanation:
based on the given text and the extracted cues, there's no clear indication of sarcasm in this message. the text appears to be a straightforward social media post, likely on twitter, sharing a video with an excited or emphatic reaction.

the hashtag ""#im#not#the#only#one#you#think#im#crazy#"" seems to be referencing the content of the video, possibly lyrics from a song or a relatable sentiment. the ""ahhhhhh"" could be an expression of excitement or realization rather than sarcasm.

without more context or a clear contrast between what's said and what's meant, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic."" the post seems to be a genuine sharing of content that the user finds relatable or exciting, rather than an attempt at irony or sarcasm.",0.0
Trying to eat crackers on the quiet floor likeee.. Maybe if I chew slower no one will notice..#not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of exaggerated language and ellipsis (""likeee.."") suggests a playful or dramatic tone.

2. the contrast between wanting to eat crackers and being on a quiet floor creates a humorous situation.

3. the internal monologue (""maybe if i chew slower no one will notice.."") is clearly meant to be humorous, as it's unlikely that chewing slower would actually make crackers quiet.

4. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it's commonly used to contradict the preceding statement, implying that the opposite is true.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic tone, poking fun at the futile attempt to eat noisy food quietly in a silent area.",1.0

Image via We Heart It https://t.co/KOZ2pho18Y #feelings #not #people #telling http://t.co/jBDXQEDjbi,0,"based on the information provided in the current cues and the input text, i cannot reliably determine if this text is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the input appears to be a social media post, likely from twitter, sharing an image with hashtags related to feelings and people. however, without seeing the actual image or having more context about the content being shared, it's impossible to judge whether sarcasm is present.

the hashtags ""#feelings #not #people #telling"" don't provide enough context to infer sarcasm. they could be straightforward tags describing the image content, or they could be part of a sarcastic message, but there's no way to know for certain from this text alone.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the absence of sufficient context, i cannot confidently assign either the ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" label to this text.",0.0

the text ""munching cheese like its christmas #stiltonoverload"" is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the phrase ""like its christmas"" is being used out of its usual context (assuming it's not actually christmas), which is a common sarcastic technique.

2. the hashtag ""#stiltonoverload"" exaggerates the situation, another hallmark of sarcasm.

3. the text playfully compares current cheese consumption to christmas-level indulgence, implying an awareness of excessive behavior but presenting it in a humorous, self-deprecating way.

4. the casual tone and use of social media conventions (hashtag) suggest a light-hearted, potentially sarcastic comment rather than a serious statement.
