the tweet appears to be praising kirya (likely a musician or public figure) as a positive role model, highlighting his linguistic abilities and emphasizing that he is ""#not a school dropout"". the message seems to be genuinely supportive and aims to correct a misconception about kirya's educational background. the tone and content do not indicate sarcasm, but rather admiration and factual clarification.",0.0
Free Pets and Animals Books #freebiebookdownload http://t.co/yL9ads7Cyf #Pets,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward announcement about free pet and animal books. there are no indicators of sarcasm present in the text. the message is direct, using hashtags and a shortened link to share information about a book download opportunity. the capitalization of ""free pets and animals books"" seems to be for emphasis rather than sarcasm. the tone is neutral and informative, typical of promotional or sharing content on social media platforms. therefore, based on the available cues and the content of the tweet, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
@PFF_Pete There will be no next employer in NFL for Trestman. He was a disgraceful hire and never stood a chance.,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the use of hyperbole in stating ""there will be no next employer in nfl for trestman"" is an exaggeration that suggests sarcastic intent.

2. the contrast between calling trestman's hire ""disgraceful"" while also saying he ""never stood a chance"" creates a paradoxical situation often found in sarcastic comments.

3. the overall tone is highly critical and employs extreme language, which is common in sarcastic remarks.

4. the use of ""@pff_pete"" suggests this is a response to someone, possibly disagreeing with or mocking a previous statement in a sarcastic manner.

these elements combined strongly indicate that the text is intended to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward statement.",1.0
Loooovvveeeeeee when my phone gets wiped -.- #not,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the exaggerated spelling of ""loooovvveeeeeee"" is a common indicator of sarcasm.
2. the context of the statement (loving when something negative happens) is inherently sarcastic.
3. the use of the emoticon ""-.-"" typically expresses annoyance or frustration, contradicting the ""love"" statement.
4. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear and explicit indicator of sarcasm, negating the positive sentiment expressed at the beginning of the sentence.

these elements combined make it clear that the statement is indeed sarcastic.",1.0
Painting all cops with a broad brush because of the actions of a few is the same logic racists use. #Irony,1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the statement, combined with the pointed comparison between criticizing all police officers and racist logic, strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic comment. the author is using irony to highlight the perceived contradiction in the thinking of those who generalize about all police officers based on the actions of a few, while presumably opposing racist generalizations. this fits well with the cues provided about the implied emotional contrasts and the use of irony to emphasize the contradiction.",1.0

"Finally finished the first season of #VeronicaMars. Move over, #CliffHuxtable. Keith Mars is the new sheriff--er, ultimate #TV dad--in town.",0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. pop culture references and wordplay: the comparison between keith mars and cliff huxtable as tv dads is playful and exaggerated.

2. the use of ""move over"" is a dramatic overstatement, implying keith mars is so superior he's displacing a long-established tv dad archetype.

3. the self-correction ""sheriff--er, ultimate tv dad"" is a clever nod to keith mars' character (former sheriff) while emphasizing the hyperbole of ""ultimate tv dad.""

4. the casual, conversational tone combined with hashtags suggests a tongue-in-cheek social media style often associated with sarcastic or witty commentary.

5. the overall enthusiasm and hyperbole in crowning a ""new ultimate tv dad"" after just one season has a playful, not entirely serious tone.

while the writer may genuinely enjoy the show, the exaggerated comparison and playful language strongly suggest a sarcastic, humorous take on tv dad characters rather than a straightforward statement.",1.0

About as relevant as Michael Sam and Jason Collins. RT @eonline: Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott comes out as gay.,0,"based on the analysis of the language style and content, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation: the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the comparison to michael sam and jason collins is likely meant to downplay the significance of dale scott coming out as gay. by saying it's ""about as relevant as"" these other athletes who previously came out, the author is implying that this news is not particularly important or noteworthy.

2. the brevity and dismissive tone of the first sentence, followed by sharing the news story, creates a contrast that is often indicative of sarcasm. the author is essentially saying ""this isn't important"" while still spreading the news.

3. the use of ""rt"" (retweet) to share the news while simultaneously diminishing its importance is a common sarcastic technique on social media platforms like twitter.

4. the informal language and social media context are conducive to sarcastic expression.

these elements together strongly suggest that the author is using sarcasm to comment on the perceived overemphasis of such news stories in the media or society at large.",1.0
Getting Final Jeopardy correct on Kids Jeopardy boosts my self-esteem,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic due to the irony present. an adult deriving self-esteem from answering a question correctly on a children's version of jeopardy is self-deprecating humor. the contrast between the trivial nature of the accomplishment (getting a question right on a kids' show) and the significant emotional impact described (boosting self-esteem) creates a humorous, sarcastic tone. this aligns with the identified rhetorical device of irony in the cues provided.",1.0
itsfunny bc people think im quiet|but im just listening toeveryones convos|and figuring out ur weaknesses|todestroy u later in life #sarcasm,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the text is explicitly marked with #sarcasm, which is a clear indicator of sarcastic intent.

2. the content of the text presents an exaggerated and humorous scenario that is not meant to be taken literally. the progression from being perceived as quiet, to secretly plotting to ""destroy"" others later in life based on overheard conversations is an absurd escalation typical of sarcastic humor.

3. the emotional words and concepts extracted (funny, quiet, listening, weaknesses, destroy) support the sarcastic tone, as they create a contrast between seeming harmless (quiet, listening) and having malicious intent (weaknesses, destroy).

4. the structure of the text, with its short, choppy phrases separated by vertical bars, adds to the dramatic effect often used in sarcastic statements.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this input text.",1.0
"Woke Up , showered , made a lunch and got ready for work only to realize that I have the whole weekend off. 😅",0,"based on the input text and the emotional cue provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the use of the sweat smile emoji (😅) at the end of the sentence is a key indicator of sarcasm in this context. the emoji conveys a sense of embarrassment or awkwardness, which aligns with the situation described. the person went through their entire morning routine preparing for work, only to realize they actually had the weekend off. this ironic situation, combined with the self-deprecating tone implied by the emoji, strongly suggests a sarcastic intent in sharing this experience.

the contrast between the detailed preparation for work and the sudden realization of having time off creates a humorous situation that is often expressed sarcastically. the emoji serves to emphasize the author's sheepish acknowledgment of their mistake, adding a layer of self-aware humor to the statement.",1.0

the text appears to be a straightforward question about economics and job wages, posed on a social media platform like twitter. it uses typical social media conventions such as mentions (@) and hashtags (#), but does not contain any indicators of sarcasm such as emotional contrasts, obvious rhetorical devices, or sentiment that would suggest the question is not meant sincerely. the tone is neutral and inquiring, seeking information rather than conveying irony or mockery.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: the text appears to be a straightforward social media post promoting a video trailer for a film called ""nicha"". the use of hashtags and a shortened url is typical for social media, especially platforms like twitter. the hashtags used (#trailer, #spoof, #film, #dramatic, #action, etc.) seem to be descriptive of the content rather than ironic or sarcastic. the tone is informative and promotional, aiming to categorize the content and make it discoverable. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, contradiction, or irony. the language is direct and appears to be genuinely describing the nature of the film (a spoof with dramatic and action elements). therefore, this text is most likely not sarcastic, but rather a straightforward announcement or promotion of a video trailer.",0.0

the use of ""#irony"" explicitly indicates sarcastic intent, while the rhetorical question ""really?"" and the addition of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) further reinforce the sarcastic tone. the author is clearly expressing skepticism or mockery towards the mention of niagara falls in a way that is not meant to be taken literally.",1.0

sarcastic

the presence of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author intended the message to be interpreted as sarcasm. the question about moving up to ""65th in the world rankings"" after hypothetical wins against poland and scotland is likely meant to highlight frustration with the team's current poor performance or low ranking, rather than being a genuine inquiry. the use of sarcasm here serves to criticize or express disappointment in the team's standing in a humorous or mocking way.",1.0

"Since the tribunal was established 14 years ago, no complaint against the intelligence services has ever been upheld. #trustthesystem #not",1,"based on the input text and the cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

explanation:
the content of the message, combined with the use of hashtags, strongly suggests sarcasm. the statement about no complaints being upheld against intelligence services in 14 years is presented in a factual manner, but the hashtags that follow reveal the author's true intent:

1. #trustthesystem - this hashtag appears to be ironic, given the context. it's suggesting blind trust in a system that has never found fault with intelligence services, which is unlikely and suspicious.

2. #not - this hashtag explicitly negates the previous one, confirming the sarcastic intent. it's a common way to indicate sarcasm in social media posts.

the contrast between the seemingly straightforward statement and the contradictory hashtags, especially the use of ""#not,"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is criticizing the lack of accountability in the intelligence services by sarcastically suggesting trust in a system that appears to be failing in its oversight role.",1.0

2. horoscopes are typically straightforward and not sarcastic in nature.
3. the phrase ""you are taking your responsibilities so seriously today"" seems to be a genuine observation or prediction, which is common in horoscopes.
4. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions.

the tweet uses the hashtag ""#not"" at the end, which is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this matches the cue information about the word ""not"" being used sarcastically to express strong disagreement. the tweet is mocking the idea of trickle-down economics by sarcastically referring to it as a ""trickle down fairy"" and then emphatically denying its effectiveness with the ""#not"" tag. this use of sarcasm to criticize an economic concept is a clear example of sarcastic speech.",1.0

2. the emphatic capitalization of ""everything"" adds to the sarcastic tone.
3. the overall exasperated tone, combined with the informal language and direct addressing of multiple users, indicates a sarcastic response to what the author perceives as an overemphasis on relating topics to the president.
4. while not overtly emotional, the frustration conveyed through the repetition of ""not"" and the structure of the question aligns with sarcastic expression.
5. the context of social media communication (twitter-like format) is often a breeding ground for sarcastic comments, especially in political discussions.

therefore, considering these factors, the text is most likely intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

1. the exaggerated laughter (""hahahaha!!"") followed immediately by ""oops......."" creates a stark emotional contrast typical of sarcastic expressions.

2. the use of excessive capitalization and multiple exclamation points for emphasis (e.g., ""hahahaha!!"", ""funny!"", ""hilarious"") often indicates overstatement or mock enthusiasm in sarcastic contexts.

3. the self-proclaimed addiction to ""@onemorejoke tweets"" and the insistence that they are ""sooo funny"" and ""#hilarious"" feels deliberately over-the-top.

4. the inclusion of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is a direct indicator that the tweet is intended to be read as sarcastic.

5. the aggressive call to action (""you got to follow him"") combined with multiple hashtags pushing for engagement (""#tweets #rt"") further reinforces the sarcastic tone, as it mimics overzealous promotional language.

#AskSuperwomanLIVE if you could swim in any liquid besides water what would you swim in?@IISuperwomanII |4,0,"based on the input and the cues provided, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

this tweet appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of the hashtag #asksuperwomanlive suggests it's part of a q&a session, but the question itself is absurd and not likely to be a serious inquiry.

2. the question ""if you could swim in any liquid besides water what would you swim in?"" is whimsical and not typical of genuine interview questions, indicating a playful or sarcastic tone.

3. the presence of multiple social media markers (hashtag, @mention, and the vertical bar with a number) is characteristic of tweets that are often used for humor or sarcasm.

4. the absurdity of the question itself (swimming in liquids other than water) is a common technique used in sarcastic or humorous content.

while the sarcasm here is subtle, the combination of the unusual question format within what appears to be a live q&a session suggests that this is likely a sarcastic or humorous tweet rather than a sincere question.",1.0

#Malala Yousufzai receives #NobelPeacePrize and #Pakistan ranks in top 10 dangerous countries !!! #irony,1,"sarcastic

1. the juxtaposition of positive and negative events: malala yousufzai receiving the nobel peace prize (a positive achievement) is contrasted with pakistan ranking among the top 10 dangerous countries (a negative status).

2. the use of ""irony"" as a hashtag: this explicitly signals the author's intention to highlight the contradictory nature of the situation.

3. multiple exclamation marks (!!!): these emphasize the author's incredulity or frustration with the situation.

4. the overall structure of the tweet: it presents two contrasting facts about pakistan in a way that highlights the absurdity of the situation.

the author is using sarcasm to point out the irony that while a pakistani citizen is recognized for promoting peace globally, the country itself is still considered one of the most dangerous. this stark contrast is the essence of the sarcastic tone in this tweet.",1.0
http://t.co/cbS3YfyKGw #Not so Ugly Christmas Sweater red with red snowflakes & sequins cardigan 1X XL http://t.co/Cy19OKfojm,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the use of ""#not"" in the context of ""not so ugly christmas sweater"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the phrase is playing with the common concept of ""ugly christmas sweaters"" by suggesting that this particular sweater is actually not ugly. the hashtag #not emphasizes this contradiction, implying that the sweater might indeed be considered ugly by some standards, but is being presented as not ugly in a tongue-in-cheek manner. this ironic use of language is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially in social media contexts.",1.0

2. the elongated ellipsis (""....."") which often indicates a pause for sarcastic effect.
3. the ""#not"" hashtag at the end, which explicitly negates the preceding statement, confirming it was meant sarcastically.

these elements together create a clear sarcastic tone, contradicting the literal meaning of the words to express frustration or annoyance at the situation described.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the phrase ""mother of the year"" is often used sarcastically when criticizing a mother's behavior.
2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be sarcastic.
3. the combination of blaming the mother and then seemingly praising her as ""mother of the year"" creates a clear contradiction, which is a common sarcastic technique.

"'I like the hope Jan Ellis writes with, the precision of the prose, and also the #humour and #irony she brings.' http://t.co/mevDxiqijg",0,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and the input text, this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of appreciation for jan ellis's writing style. the author lists specific qualities they admire in ellis's work, including hope, precision, humor, and irony. the use of positive descriptors, the detailed nature of the praise, and the inclusion of a link (presumably to ellis's work) all suggest that this is a sincere compliment rather than a sarcastic comment.

the rhetorical devices identified, such as enumeration and parallelism, are used to structure the praise effectively. the emotional words and contrasts (hope, humor, irony) are presented in a positive context. the language style information extracted also supports a genuine appreciation of the author's work.

while humor and irony are mentioned, they are presented as qualities of ellis's writing, not as indicators that this tweet itself is meant to be humorous or ironic. the hashtags (#humour and #irony) seem to be used to emphasize these aspects of ellis's style rather than to indicate sarcasm in the tweet itself.

therefore, considering all the available information, this tweet is most likely ""not sarcastic"" but rather a sincere expression of admiration for jan ellis's writing.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of desire for fun and social activities, contrasted with work obligations. while there's a hint of tension between wanting to have fun and needing to work, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. the use of hashtags, informal language, and the reference to ""girls just wanna have fun"" (likely alluding to the popular song) all seem genuine rather than sarcastic. the tweet is more likely expressing a sincere desire for enjoyment with friends, dancing, and drinks, despite work commitments.",0.0
"The Bay Area storm is so big that tons of people's work was canceled today, causing me to be early to mine. #irony #stormageddon",1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly signals the author's sarcastic intent.
2. the term ""stormageddon"" (a blend of ""storm"" and ""armageddon"") is hyperbolic and typically used humorously or sarcastically to describe severe weather.
3. the contrast between the expectation (work being canceled for many) and the personal outcome (being early to work) creates a situational irony that is often the basis for sarcastic comments.
4. the overall tone suggests the author is poking fun at the situation, using exaggeration (""so big"", ""tons of people"") to highlight the unexpected personal result.

these elements strongly indicate that the text is meant to be read as sarcastic commentary on the situation.",1.0

"A 'republican move' which will 'effectively rob the royals'. Kate's spending 32k on1meal, who is being robbed? #irony http://t.co/OTbeWggbTJ",1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""republican move"" and ""effectively rob the royals"" suggests skepticism or mockery of these phrases.
2. the rhetorical question ""who is being robbed?"" highlights the irony of the situation.
3. the explicit use of the hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet.
4. the contrast between the claim of royals being ""robbed"" and kate spending an extravagant amount (32k) on a single meal.

the informal tone, abbreviated language (32k), and twitter-style formatting with a shortened url also support the overall sarcastic nature of the message. the author is clearly criticizing the excessive spending of the royals while sarcastically referring to them as being ""robbed.""",1.0
#obama @DemocratWire announce special urgent package for #Pakistan .. supported by @GOP to enhance their fight against obscurantists. #NOT,1,"sarcastic

this tweet is almost certainly sarcastic. several factors point to this:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, directly contradicting the seemingly positive statement that precedes it.

2. the content describes an unlikely scenario where obama, democrats, and republicans are all enthusiastically supporting aid to pakistan, which is not reflective of typical u.s. political dynamics.

3. the phrase ""special urgent package"" and ""fight against obscurantists"" use exaggerated language that seems designed to mock political rhetoric.

4. the combination of multiple political entities (@democratwire, @gop) working together seamlessly is presented in a way that seems unrealistically harmonious, further suggesting sarcasm.

the overall tone and structure of the tweet, culminating in the ""#not"" hashtag, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment on u.s. foreign policy and political cooperation, rather than a genuine statement of support.",1.0

"how is it possible that somebody so interesting is also so, so, so boring? #irony #what",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear markers of sarcasm:

1. it presents a paradoxical situation (someone being both interesting and boring), which is a common sarcastic device.
2. the repetition of ""so"" in ""so, so, so boring"" exaggerates the statement, another typical sarcastic technique.
3. the use of the hashtag #irony explicitly signals the sarcastic intent.
4. the hashtag #what further emphasizes the feigned confusion or disbelief, which is characteristic of sarcastic expressions.

the emotional contrast between ""interesting"" and ""boring,"" combined with the exaggerated language and explicit irony markers, strongly indicates that this statement is meant to be understood as sarcastic.",1.0
"@Pier1984_ Not going this time, we might have a chance! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..... #fuckthat",0,"sarcastic

given the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this tweet. here's why:

1. the phrase ""we might have a chance!"" is likely meant ironically, especially when followed by the rest of the message.

2. the use of the proverb ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..."" implies the speaker has been disappointed before and is skeptical about being fooled again.

3. the hashtag ""#fuckthat"" at the end expresses strong frustration or defiance, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

4. the overall structure of the tweet starts with a seemingly positive statement (""we might have a chance!"") but then quickly undermines it with skepticism and frustration, which is a common sarcastic technique.

the combination of skepticism, implied past disappointment, and the strong language in the hashtag all point to a sarcastic interpretation of the text, rather than a sincere statement.",1.0
@dzmilner Minky Wale tail fritter for price of a bijoux flat in Port Talbot.,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. hyperbole: the comparison of a whale tail fritter's price to that of a small flat is an extreme exaggeration, which is a common sarcastic technique.

2. unusual juxtaposition: combining a fancy-sounding food item (""minky wale tail fritter"") with a less glamorous location (""port talbot"") creates a humorous contrast.

3. informal language and social media style: the casual tone and twitter-like format are often used for sarcastic comments online.

4. implicit criticism: the statement seems to be indirectly criticizing the high price of the food item by making an absurd comparison.

5. lack of explicit emotional words: sarcasm often relies on tone and context rather than overt emotional expressions.

these elements together strongly suggest that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically, likely commenting on the perceived overpricing of a food item in a humorous and exaggerated way.",1.0

sarcastic

the contrast between the cheerful greeting elements (""#hi #good #morning"", ""happy"") and the desire to stay asleep (""#sleep #do #not #wake #up"") creates a sarcastic tone. this juxtaposition of conflicting sentiments is a common feature of sarcasm, where the literal meaning contradicts the intended message. the person seems to be sarcastically expressing that while it's supposed to be a ""good morning,"" they would rather continue sleeping, implying they're not actually happy about waking up or starting the day.",1.0

2. the use of ""#not"" explicitly negates the positive statement, confirming it's not meant sincerely.

3. ""#thanks"" is used sarcastically here, as the user is clearly not thankful for the poor experience.

2. the cues mention a ""sarcastic tone indicated,"" which aligns with the hashtags and overall content.

Christmas alone😊 how nice #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this hashtag is commonly used to negate or contradict the preceding statement, implying the opposite meaning.

2. the contrast between the positive words ""nice"" and the smiling emoji 😊 with the reality of being alone on christmas further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

3. the cues provided also support this interpretation, specifically mentioning the use of ""#not"" to contradict the previous statement and identifying the overall tone as sarcastic.

4. being alone on christmas is generally not considered a positive experience for most people, so describing it as ""nice"" is likely to be insincere and sarcastic.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this input.",1.0

Yay for Fire Alarms at 3AM #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input based on the following reasons:

1. the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this hashtag is commonly used on social media to denote that the preceding statement should be interpreted sarcastically.

2. the exclamation ""yay"" contrasts sharply with the unpleasant situation of fire alarms at 3 am, which further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

3. the cues provided align perfectly with this interpretation, noting the informal style, use of sarcasm, social media conventions, brevity, and expression of frustration through irony.

4. the juxtaposition of a positive expression (""yay"") with a clearly negative experience (fire alarms disrupting sleep) is a classic sarcastic technique.

therefore, this text is undoubtedly sarcastic in nature.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author intended this statement to be interpreted as sarcastic. the juxtaposition of a ""healthy, homemade, all fruit smoothie"" being consumed from a budweiser beer glass creates a humorous contrast that embodies the essence of situational irony. this contradiction between the healthy drink and the unhealthy drink's container is deliberately pointed out by the author, emphasizing the sarcastic tone of the statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the tweet uses exaggerated self-criticism (""damn i #suck""), emoticons expressing sadness ("":-(""), and dramatic expressions (""#sob!"") in a way that seems overblown for simply asking about shading techniques. this overreaction to a relatively minor issue in artwork is a common sarcastic technique, where someone pretends to be overly emotional or dramatic about something trivial for humorous effect. the hashtag usage and overall structure of the tweet also contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1.0

i wanna be at home already,0,"not sarcastic

the input text ""i wanna be at home already"" appears to be a straightforward expression of desire and mild frustration, rather than a sarcastic statement. the analysis of language style, emotional content, and lack of rhetorical devices all point to a genuine sentiment. 

the informal, colloquial language and lack of punctuation are typical of casual digital communication, not indicators of sarcasm. the emotion conveyed is a simple longing to be home, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.

the use of ""already"" does imply some impatience, but this reinforces the sincerity of the desire rather than introducing a sarcastic tone. there's no apparent contradiction or exaggeration that might signal sarcasm.

given these factors, the most appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
Just realized my last final is tomorrow. FAAAAA-,0,"based on the given input and the current cues, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

this text exhibits characteristics of sarcasm for the following reasons:

1. the sudden realization about an impending final exam is a common source of stress for students, and the exaggerated reaction suggests a sarcastic tone.

2. the use of all caps for ""faaaaa-"" implies a dramatic, over-the-top response, which is often associated with sarcastic expressions.

3. the cut-off expletive (faaaaa-) is likely meant to be humorous rather than a genuine expression of distress, further indicating sarcasm.

4. the juxtaposition of the casual ""just realized"" with the intense reaction creates a comedic effect often found in sarcastic statements.

while the text could be interpreted as a genuine expression of panic, the exaggerated nature of the response and the typical use of such expressions in online communication suggests that this is more likely a sarcastic comment on the common experience of last-minute exam anxiety.",1.0

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, implying the opposite of what is literally stated.

2. the phrase ""too bizarre to be true"" followed by ""#not"" suggests that the speaker actually believes it is true, despite its apparent absurdity.

3. the emotional contrasts noted in the cues, particularly the use of ""twist"" and ""bizarre,"" contribute to the sarcastic tone.

4. the content itself presents an seemingly absurd idea (algorithms causing congestion and pollution) in a way that implies it might actually be true, which is a common sarcastic technique.

1. the use of the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it's used to negate the previous statement, implying the opposite of what was said.

2. the hashtag ""#greatmorning"" is likely being used ironically, given the context of the negative events described (ranting and the ipod dying).

3. the phrase ""just ranted"" followed by a description of technology failing (ipod dying) sets up a frustrating scenario, which is often a context for sarcastic comments.

4. the overall tone of the tweet is negative, but it ends with a seemingly positive hashtag (#greatmorning), which is then immediately contradicted by #not. this juxtaposition is a common sarcastic technique.

therefore, the text is clearly sarcastic, using irony to express frustration about the situation described.",1.0
30 week scan #not #long #now #exciting #memory #all #good #happy #clear #baby #boy @ Portlaoise... http://t.co/CLfUfZ3vdF,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine, excited social media post about a 30-week pregnancy scan. the language used is positive and anticipatory, with no indicators of sarcasm or irony. the hashtags and emotional words like ""exciting,"" ""good,"" and ""happy"" all support a sincere, non-sarcastic tone. the context of sharing a pregnancy milestone (30-week scan) and revealing the baby's gender (boy) further reinforces the likelihood that this is a straightforward, joyful announcement rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0
@cnsnews Obama and Hillary convinced Ukraine that they would protect them if they essentially disarm. Need to keep at least one promise.,0,"sarcastic

based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe this tweet is sarcastic. here's why:

1. the tweet refers to obama and hillary making a promise to protect ukraine if they disarm, but the final sentence ""need to keep at least one promise"" implies that they haven't kept their promises in general.

2. the use of ""essentially disarm"" suggests a critical view of the situation, implying that ukraine was left vulnerable.

3. the tone of the tweet, particularly the last sentence, carries a mocking or cynical undertone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

4. the contrast between the initial trust (being ""convinced"") and the implied failure to follow through on promises creates the ironic setup typical of sarcastic statements.

5. the cues mentioning ""trust, vulnerability, and obligation"" align with the sarcastic interpretation, as the tweet is playing on these concepts to criticize the leaders' actions.

therefore, considering these factors, i'm confident in labeling this tweet as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

4. the excessive use of hashtags (11 in total) is often associated with sarcastic or ironic social media posts.
5. the overall tone of the message conveys frustration and displeasure through sarcasm, rather than a genuine desire to be sick or go to school.",1.0

"@davidwhite_ Nevermind that, but do pray tell,would Scherzy still play Grizabella?",0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a genuine inquiry about casting for a theatrical role.
2. while the language style mixes modern social media conventions with archaic phrasing (""pray tell""), this seems to be a stylistic choice rather than sarcasm.
3. there are no clear emotional contrasts or overtly sarcastic elements detected.
4. the question seems straightforward, asking about whether ""scherzy"" (likely a nickname) would play the role of grizabella.
5. the tone is inquisitive and casual, without any apparent irony or mocking undertones that would suggest sarcasm.

the combination of theatrical references with social media style creates an interesting contrast, but it doesn't appear to be employed for sarcastic effect. instead, it seems to be a sincere question asked in a somewhat playful or dramatically stylized manner.",0.0

Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top UNLESS YOU'RE SKINNY #Shade #Sarcasm #TheMoreYouKnow,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. here's why:

1. the text contains a contradictory statement: it starts by saying ""every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top"" but then immediately contradicts this with ""unless you're skinny.""

2. the use of all caps for ""unless you're skinny"" adds emphasis and indicates a dramatic shift in tone, which is often used in sarcastic statements.

3. the hashtags at the end, especially ""#sarcasm,"" explicitly indicate that the statement is meant to be sarcastic.

4. the phrase ""#shade"" also suggests that the statement is meant to be critical or mocking in a subtle way.

5. the overall structure of the statement mimics positive body image messages but then subverts them, which is a common sarcastic technique.

6. the final hashtag ""#themoreyouknow"" is often used ironically to introduce obviously false or satirical information.

given these clear indicators, particularly the explicit use of ""#sarcasm,"" this text is unambiguously sarcastic.",1.0

2. use of emojis (😎😂) that suggest the author is joking or finding humor in the statement.

4. the other hashtags seem to be constructing a phrase that contradicts the main text: ""#its #about"" (the calves) ""#not #about #the #arms"".

the overall tone and structure suggest that the author is likely making a joke about focusing on calves instead of arms, possibly mocking fitness trends or body image expectations. the sarcasm is used to highlight the absurdity of fixating on specific body parts.",1.0

sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

4. the use of informal language and social media conventions (mentions, hashtags) is consistent with the context where sarcasm is often employed.

these elements, combined with the critical stance towards the journalist's writing, strongly indicate that the statement is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

Being a light sleeper is the best. #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input for the following reasons:

1. the statement ""being a light sleeper is the best"" is likely not meant to be taken literally. light sleepers often have difficulty getting restful sleep, which is generally not considered a positive trait.

2. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the hashtag ""not"" is commonly used on social media to denote that the preceding statement should be interpreted as the opposite of what was said.

3. the contrast between the positive statement and the negating hashtag is a classic sarcastic structure, where the true meaning is the opposite of what is literally stated.

4. the punctuation cue of the hashtag (#) further supports the sarcastic interpretation, as hashtags are often used to add commentary or additional meaning to statements on social media platforms.

given these factors, particularly the use of ""#not,"" this text is clearly intended to be sarcastic, expressing frustration with being a light sleeper rather than genuine appreciation for it.",1.0

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

3. the hashtags ""#not good enough"" and ""#gutted"" reinforce the negative sentiment, which contrasts with the initial ""easiest"" claim, underlining the sarcastic nature of the comment.

4. the overall structure of the tweet, starting with a seemingly positive statement and then contradicting it with negative outcomes, is a typical sarcastic pattern.

Also it's amazing how a shower and Taco Bell can make you feel like a new person. @TacoBellProbbs,0,"based on the input text and the cues provided, i believe i can make a reliable judgment. 

label: sarcastic

this tweet appears to be sarcastic for a few reasons:

1. the use of hyperbole: claiming that a shower and taco bell can make you feel like a ""new person"" is an exaggeration typically used in sarcastic statements.

2. the juxtaposition of a shower (something generally considered refreshing and cleansing) with taco bell (fast food that's often jokingly associated with less positive effects) creates a humorous contrast that's common in sarcastic remarks.

3. the inclusion of ""@tacobellprobbs"" at the end suggests the user is referencing common jokes or complaints about taco bell, likely in a tongue-in-cheek manner.

4. the overall tone of the tweet seems to be making light of the effects of taco bell, rather than genuinely praising it as ""amazing.""

these factors, combined with the casual, exaggerated language, strongly indicate that this tweet is meant to be read as sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

this text appears to be a genuine birthday wish to someone named becca, followed by a friendly comment about looking through photos. the tone is enthusiastic and sincere, using capitalization for emphasis in the birthday greeting. the hyperbole about the number of photos is a common friendly exaggeration rather than sarcasm. the ellipsis and link at the end suggest the message continues, likely with a photo or more information, which is typical for sincere social media birthday wishes. there are no contradictory elements or subtle jabs that would indicate sarcasm.",0.0

"Heartless Sanghi #Sarcasm""@Retributions: #IndiawithPakistan because a dumb nation deserves to be taken for a ride again and again. #Lakhvi""",0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" in the text, which directly indicates the sarcastic intent.
2. the contradictory nature of the statement ""#indiawithpakistan"" followed by a negative comment about a ""dumb nation,"" which is a classic sarcastic structure.
3. the use of terms like ""heartless sanghi"" (sanghi being a term often used critically for right-wing hindu nationalists) in conjunction with apparent support for pakistan, creating an ironic contrast.

I guess waking up every couple hours is cool |#not,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the statement ""i guess waking up every couple hours is cool"" is already suggesting sarcasm, as most people would not genuinely find frequent sleep interruptions to be ""cool.""

2. the use of ""|#not"" at the end is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the ""#not"" hashtag is commonly used in social media and informal writing to explicitly denote that the preceding statement should be interpreted as sarcastic or the opposite of what was literally stated.

3. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""i guess,"" also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's often used to introduce a statement that the speaker doesn't actually believe or agree with.

these elements, combined with the context of sleep disturbance being described as ""cool,"" clearly indicate that this statement is sarcastic.",1.0

### explanation:
based on the given cues and the input text, i believe this is not a sarcastic statement. here's why:

1. the text is formatted as a genuine question about workload and delegation, which are common business or productivity topics.
2. the extensive use of hashtags is likely for visibility and searchability on social media platforms, not to convey sarcasm.
3. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would typically indicate sarcasm.
4. the inclusion of a link suggests that this is likely a sincere attempt to direct readers to more information on the topic.
5. the language is straightforward and doesn't employ any typical sarcastic devices like hyperbole or mocking tones.

while the excessive use of hashtags might seem unusual, it's more likely a social media strategy rather than an attempt at sarcasm. the question posed seems to be a genuine prompt for reflection on work habits and management skills.",0.0
"@Boeing, @SpaceX told to stop work under crew contracts #irony http://t.co/1Hyb70IATA",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the presence of ""#irony"" in the tweet is a strong indicator of sarcastic intent.

2. the content of the tweet appears to be highlighting a contradictory or unexpected situation (boeing and spacex being told to stop work on crew contracts), which is often a target for sarcasm.

3. the use of hashtags and shortened links is common in social media posts that employ sarcasm to comment on current events or news.

sarcastic

the tweet exhibits clear sarcastic undertones. the author expresses a repeated, futile attempt to like chris brown, which is consistently undermined by brown's own actions. this creates a stark contrast between the desire to appreciate the artist and the frustration caused by his behavior, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the use of phrases like ""try to like"" followed by ""royally eff that up"" and calling him a ""chronic loose cannon"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone. the hashtags at the end also suggest a commentary on brown's public image and controversies, adding to the overall sarcastic sentiment.",1.0

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward social media post about christmas decorating. the use of hashtags, emoji, and informal language is typical of sincere social media communication. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the tone seems genuinely positive and excited about the decorating process. therefore, i conclude that this text is not sarcastic.",0.0
Look good feel good! #not #TeamNoSleep #cantopeneyes,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the initial statement ""look good feel good!"" is positive, but it's immediately followed by contradictory hashtags that negate and undermine the sentiment:

1. ""#not"" directly contradicts the previous statement
2. ""#teamnosleep"" implies the speaker is exhausted
3. ""#cantopeneyes"" further emphasizes extreme tiredness

the contrast between the upbeat opening statement and the following hashtags that describe a state of exhaustion creates irony, which is a key component of sarcasm. the speaker is using this contrast to humorously communicate that they actually don't look or feel good due to lack of sleep.",1.0
How much did it cost to build #mygov #medicare? I see this way too often... http://t.co/N0Pdpiq1RQ,0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics that suggest sarcasm:

1. rhetorical question: the question about the cost of building #mygov and #medicare is likely not seeking a genuine answer, but rather implying criticism or skepticism about government spending.

2. exaggeration: the phrase ""i see this way too often..."" suggests an exaggerated frequency, which is a common sarcastic device.

3. ellipsis: the use of ""..."" can indicate a trailing off thought, often used in sarcastic or ironic statements to let the reader infer the implied criticism.

4. contrast between formal and informal language: the formal-sounding question about government programs is followed by a more casual, exasperated statement, creating a tonal contrast often found in sarcasm.

5. context implied by hashtags: the use of #mygov and #medicare suggests a political context where sarcasm is often employed to express dissatisfaction or criticism.

6. inclusion of a link: the shortened url at the end implies that there's additional context or evidence to support the sarcastic stance.

given these cues, the tweet appears to be using sarcasm to criticize government spending or inefficiency in relation to these programs.",1.0
That sad moment you realize you're past the point of having all those presents under the tree. I wanna move back in.,0,"sarcastic

Gotta love a Romanian playing an improvised version of jingle bells in a minor key. Really sets the festive mood. #not,1,"sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of ""gotta love"" at the beginning, which is often used sarcastically to introduce something the speaker actually dislikes.

2. the description of an unconventional and potentially unpleasant musical performance (improvised jingle bells in a minor key by a romanian) as something that ""sets the festive mood.""

3. the ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to explicitly signal sarcasm on social media, indicating that the preceding statement should be interpreted as meaning the opposite of what was said.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic comment about an unusual and likely unappealing musical experience that the speaker is presenting as the opposite of festive or enjoyable.",1.0

Lol hilarious pic RT @WizGameEnt: What a game! @WashWizards win! http://t.co/9BJVI8V4Hx,0,"not sarcastic

based on the provided cues and the content of the tweet, i believe this tweet is genuinely expressing excitement and amusement, not sarcasm. here's why:

1. the emotional words and tone are consistently positive (e.g., ""lol hilarious"", ""what a game!"", ""win!"").
2. the language style is typical of casual, enthusiastic social media communication.
3. there's no indication of contrast or incongruity that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the tweet appears to be genuinely celebrating a win by the washington wizards basketball team.
5. the use of exclamation marks reinforces the excited tone.

given these factors, it's most likely that the user is sincerely expressing enjoyment about the game and the team's victory, rather than being sarcastic.",0.0
You've set yourself some target to achieve there like love #hot or #not http://t.co/IbXXkKRsto,0,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward social media post, likely on twitter, given the use of hashtags and a shortened url.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or sarcasm in the language used.
3. the tone seems casual and potentially supportive, mentioning setting a target to achieve.
4. the hashtags #hot and #not seem to be used in their literal sense, possibly referring to a trend or challenge, rather than as sarcastic commentary.
5. the presence of the word ""love"" and the encouraging tone about setting targets suggest a genuine, non-sarcastic message.
6. there's no obvious contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning that would suggest sarcasm.

while social media posts can often contain sarcasm, in this case, the text appears to be a straightforward comment or observation without any clear sarcastic elements.",0.0
"Change is a Process, ||#Not an Event dafuq you thinking",0,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text begins with a seemingly motivational or thoughtful statement: ""change is a process, not an event.""
2. however, this is immediately followed by ""dafuq you thinking,"" which is a stark contrast in tone and formality.
3. the use of ""dafuq"" (a slang version of ""what the fuck"") at the end introduces a sudden, informal, and somewhat aggressive tone that contradicts the wisdom of the initial statement.
4. the juxtaposition of the formal, inspirational-sounding first part with the very casual, almost confrontational second part creates a sarcastic effect.
5. the structure suggests that the speaker is mocking or sarcastically commenting on the type of motivational quotes often shared on social media.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the text is intended to be sarcastic, poking fun at typical motivational phrases by abruptly undermining them with colloquial language.",1.0

"@zainabimam ""Malala is fake and planted by the US coz Pakistan is perfectly safe for kids going to school"" #PeshawarAttack #Sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. this can be determined from several factors:

1. the content of the quote is absurd and contradictory to known facts about safety issues in pakistan, especially in light of the referenced #peshawarattack.

2. the use of ""fake and planted by the us"" is a common conspiracy theory trope used ironically here.

3. the phrase ""perfectly safe"" is used sarcastically to highlight the opposite reality.

4. most importantly, the tweet ends with the explicit hashtag #sarcasm, leaving no doubt about the intended tone.

therefore, the correct label for this input is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1.0
Seriously has the #BBL04 got the tallest on ground interviewers of all time #talltowers #sevenfoot,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this tweet.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
while the tweet uses hyperbole and humor to emphasize the height of the interviewers, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the exaggeration seems to be used for comedic effect and to express genuine amazement at the interviewers' height, rather than to convey the opposite of what is literally said. the use of hashtags like #talltowers and #sevenfoot further reinforces the humorous observation without introducing any contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, this tweet is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
#Funny #18+ Turn On aquabreeze:||disgustinghotels:||#not all men http://t.co/F4OEPX8uob,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input text, which appears to be a social media post with hashtags and a shortened url, it's difficult to definitively determine if sarcasm is present. however, given the combination of seemingly unrelated hashtags and the inclusion of ""#not all men"" (which is often used sarcastically in online discourse), i would lean towards labeling this as:

sarcastic

the juxtaposition of ""#funny"" and ""#18+"" with ""#not all men"" suggests a potentially ironic or sarcastic tone, though without more context it's impossible to be certain. the label is assigned with low confidence due to the brevity and ambiguity of the input.",1.0
Yay jury duty 😒 #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. here's why:

1. the use of ""yay"" paired with ""jury duty"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. jury duty is generally not considered an exciting or enjoyable activity, so expressing enthusiasm about it is likely insincere.

2. the rolling eyes emoji (😒) further reinforces the sarcastic tone. this emoji is often used to express annoyance or displeasure, contradicting the seemingly positive ""yay.""

3. the explicit use of the hashtag #sarcasm leaves no doubt about the intended tone of the message.

4. the brief, casual nature of the text is consistent with typical sarcastic comments on social media.

all these elements together create a clear example of sarcasm, making this classification highly reliable.",1.0

the tweet appears to be a lighthearted, humorous comment about a hairstyle rather than a sarcastic statement. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) and the casual, conversational tone suggest the speaker is making a genuine, albeit funny, observation about someone's appearance. the phrase ""what i call"" indicates they're offering their own amusing description of the hairstyle as ""the wet look."" while playful, this doesn't have the hallmarks of sarcasm such as irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. therefore, based on the content and tone, this tweet is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0
A burned tongue is a lovely way to start the day #sarcasm #ouch,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

1. the content of the statement is clearly sarcastic. describing a burned tongue as ""a lovely way to start the day"" is the opposite of what most people would genuinely feel, indicating sarcasm.

2. the use of the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly marks the statement as sarcastic.

3. the additional hashtag #ouch reinforces the negative experience, contrasting with the ""lovely"" description and further emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

4. the structure of the sentence, using positive words to describe a negative experience, is a common sarcastic technique.

therefore, this statement is definitively sarcastic.",1.0

sarcastic

explanation:
1. the use of hashtags like ""#socool"" and ""#not"" together indicates sarcasm, as they contradict each other.
2. the overall tone of the message is mocking behavior that the author considers annoying or unappealing.
3. the hashtag ""#howtogetunfollowed"" is itself sarcastic, as it's framed as advice but is actually criticizing behavior that would lead to losing followers.
4. the final hashtag ""#gtfo"" (get the f*** out) further emphasizes the negative sentiment towards the described behavior, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

the combination of contradictory hashtags, mock advice, and the overall critical tone strongly indicates that this text is sarcastic.",1.0

2. the follow-up hashtags #not and #sonot explicitly negate the previous statement, emphasizing the sarcastic intent.

3. the context of the tweet suggests the author is frustrated or disappointed about missing the opportunity to see jeremy irons and alan rickman in marrakech by just one week, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement ""everything is fine.""

We may be some time. #Hibernot #Not http://t.co/n5z2IXabq9,0,"sarcastic

### explanation:
this tweet appears to be sarcastic based on several factors:

1. allusion: the phrase ""we may be some time"" is likely a reference to captain lawrence oates' famous last words before his death during an antarctic expedition. this historical allusion is being used in a context that's probably much less serious, creating a ironic contrast.

2. hashtags: the use of ""#hibernot"" and ""#not"" together suggests a playful contradiction. ""hibernot"" implies not hibernating, while ""not"" further emphasizes negation, possibly mocking or contradicting the idea of staying inactive.

3. brevity and tone: the short, matter-of-fact tone of the statement, combined with the hashtags, suggests a dry or deadpan humor often associated with sarcasm.

4. context mismatch: without seeing the linked image, we can infer that the serious-sounding statement is likely being applied to a much less serious situation, creating a humorous mismatch typical of sarcasm.

while we don't have the full context, the combination of these elements strongly suggests that this tweet is using sarcasm to make a point or joke about some activity or situation, likely related to not hibernating or staying active during a time when one might typically be inactive.",1.0

@TorontoStar: NDP to introduce bill to make OHIP public #not appropriate # confidentiality,0,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i would assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of hashtags, especially ""#not appropriate"" and ""#confidentiality,"" suggests a sarcastic tone. these hashtags appear to be commenting on the content of the tweet rather than being genuine tags.

2. the message itself seems to be pointing out an irony or contradiction. the ontario health insurance plan (ohip) is already a public healthcare system, so introducing a bill to ""make ohip public"" doesn't make logical sense, indicating sarcasm.

3. the combination of a serious-sounding news headline with contradictory hashtags is a common format for sarcastic social media posts.

4. the use of punctuation (colon and hashtags) aligns with typical patterns seen in sarcastic tweets, where formal structure is mixed with informal commentary.

given these factors, the tweet appears to be using sarcasm to comment on or criticize some aspect of healthcare policy or political action related to ohip.",1.0

the text is clearly sarcastic. the speaker uses the polite form of address ""ladies"" and references proper ladylike behavior, but does so in order to criticize and insult the person they're addressing. the contrast between the seemingly respectful language and the insulting implication creates verbal irony, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the final statement ""but i guess you are not one"" confirms the sarcastic intent by explicitly stating the insult that was implied in the first part.",1.0
@RosieMorse I hate you lol,0,"sarcastic

i believe this label is reliable based on the provided cues and input text. the combination of ""i hate you"" immediately followed by ""lol"" (laugh out loud) strongly suggests sarcasm. in casual online communication, especially on platforms like twitter, this pattern is often used to express the opposite of what is literally said - in this case, likely indicating affection or friendly teasing rather than actual hatred. the informal style and use of ""lol"" to undercut the seemingly negative statement are classic markers of sarcastic intent in social media contexts.",1.0
I didn't know it's your territory I really. .. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN- no. . Please don't shoot at me I. .,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

"Shopping day with Ms 15 today. Her haul included new Docs, eyeliner, bras, new issue Frankie mag, and half of Kikki K. Tired and broke now.",0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward account of a shopping day with a 15-year-old, listing the items purchased and ending with a genuine expression of feeling tired and financially drained. the language is casual and typical of social media posts or text messages. while there is a slight hyperbole in ""half of kikki k,"" this is a common figure of speech used to emphasize the amount of shopping done, rather than a sarcastic statement.

the emotional contrast between the excitement of shopping and the resulting tiredness and financial impact is presented in a matter-of-fact way, without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the writer seems to be simply sharing their day's activities and resulting feelings, which is consistent with a non-sarcastic tone.

therefore, based on the cues provided and the content of the text, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

@Margoandhow @imalexbeamyrnot spawn of Larry Ellison aka World's Worst Human,0,"given the context and the cues provided, i can confidently assign a label to this input text.

label: sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to criticize larry ellison. the phrase ""world's worst human"" is an exaggerated, hyperbolic description that is not meant to be taken literally. this extreme characterization, combined with the casual and dismissive tone of calling someone ""spawn of larry ellison,"" indicates a sarcastic intent to mock or criticize ellison and, by extension, whoever is being referred to as his ""spawn.""",1.0
Really loves dentist appointments. #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input for the following reasons:

2. the use of ""#sarcasm"": the hashtag explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically.

3. the punctuation cue: the period at the end of the sentence gives a sense of finality or seriousness to the statement, which contrasts with the actual sarcastic intent, enhancing the sarcastic effect.

this text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

2. the exaggerated expression of shock (""i'm shocked""), which is likely insincere given the context.

3. the exclamation marks, which often indicate exaggerated or insincere enthusiasm in sarcastic statements.

"Google scholarship application kept crashing in Chrome. Opened it in IE, finished application without incident. #irony",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the tweet contains clear elements of irony and sarcasm:

3. the contrast between the initial frustration (application ""kept crashing"") and the unexpected solution (using ie) creates a humorous effect typical of sarcastic observations.

@AusPublica @KateOnTheGo Your views are not right wing or left wing...just vile.,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. it uses a seemingly polite structure (""your views are..."") to deliver a harsh criticism.
2. the ellipsis (...) creates a pause for dramatic effect, building up to an unexpected and strongly negative conclusion.
3. the contrast between the neutral beginning (""not right wing or left wing"") and the sharp, judgmental ending (""just vile"") is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the overall tone is confrontational and dismissive, which often accompanies sarcastic statements.
5. the use of social media style mentions (@username) suggests a public, performative aspect to the criticism, which is common in sarcastic online interactions.

while the statement is clearly critical, the sarcastic element comes from the way it's structured to subvert expectations, making it more biting than a straightforward criticism would be.",1.0
@ramzaruglia @gamergater7685 Ah the 2014 #GamerGate Ebola campaign. How many people did we kill? #sarcasm,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the tweet contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly tags the tweet as sarcastic.
2. the rhetorical question ""how many people did we kill?"" is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to mock the idea that gamergate was responsible for deaths.
3. the reference to a fictional ""ebola campaign"" associated with gamergate is clearly exaggerated and not meant to be taken seriously.
4. the overall tone is mocking and ironic, typical of sarcastic communication.

therefore, this tweet is undoubtedly sarcastic in nature.",1.0
"Where is the promise of ""peace on earth"" in this? ""Lord, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done."" http://t.co/sSYoNx0IAo #Advent #terror #irony",1,"sarcastic

the input text displays clear sarcastic elements, particularly through the use of emotional contrasts and the juxtaposition of religious peace-oriented language with hashtags indicating violence and irony. the rhetorical question ""where is the promise of 'peace on earth' in this?"" followed by a religious quote and contrasting hashtags like #terror and #irony strongly suggests a sarcastic tone. the author is using irony to highlight the disconnect between religious ideals and the reality of current events, making the label ""sarcastic"" the most appropriate choice.",1.0

explanation:
the text appears to be a direct, confrontational accusation without any indicators of sarcasm. the use of capitalization for emphasis (""you""), the straightforward accusation of violence, and the inclusion of multiple twitter handles suggest that this is a sincere, albeit aggressive, statement. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or irony that would typically characterize sarcastic speech. the tone is consistent with a genuine expression of disapproval or accusation rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0
Gael 'pro at presentations' Anderson #not #choke,1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""pro at presentations"" suggests irony or sarcasm, implying that gael anderson is actually not good at presentations.

2. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#choke"" further reinforce the sarcastic tone. ""#not"" is commonly used to negate the previous statement in a sarcastic manner, while ""#choke"" implies that gael anderson likely struggles or ""chokes"" during presentations.

3. the combination of seemingly positive praise (""pro at presentations"") with contradictory hashtags creates a clear sarcastic contrast.

this structure and word choice are typical of sarcastic comments on social media, where people often use irony and contradictory elements to express sarcasm.",1.0
Nothing says nature like the relentless sound of AM commuter traffic #fthunter #AMdogfun #not@allpeaceful,1,"based on the content and context of the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the statement ""nothing says nature like the relentless sound of am commuter traffic"" is inherently contradictory. nature is typically associated with peace and quiet, not the noise of traffic.

2. the use of ""relentless"" to describe the traffic sound emphasizes the negative aspect, contrasting sharply with the positive connotation typically associated with nature.

3. the hashtags, especially ""#not@allpeaceful"", further confirm the sarcastic tone by explicitly stating that the situation is not peaceful, contradicting the initial implication about nature.

4. the overall tone suggests frustration with a noisy, urban environment intruding on what should be a natural, peaceful experience.

the use of sarcasm here effectively highlights the contrast between expectations of a natural setting and the reality of urban noise pollution.",1.0

Best Christmas Eve news: I have a half sister. 😂👍 #sarcasm #thanksdad,1,"based on the current cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the message is meant to be sarcastic.
2. the phrase ""best christmas eve news"" is used ironically, as finding out about a half-sister unexpectedly is typically not considered positive news.
3. the laughing emoji (😂) and thumbs up emoji (👍) are used to convey sarcastic amusement rather than genuine happiness.
4. the hashtag #thanksdad is likely used sarcastically to express disappointment or frustration with the father's actions.
5. the overall tone of the message suggests that the news is actually unwelcome or surprising, contrary to the ""best"" description.

these elements combined clearly indicate that the message is intended to be sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0
Brother💙 we don't look alike #not #frère #family #lovehim http://t.co/nCAt8xXqxQ,0,"not sarcastic

@GalloSays at least there's a good football game on with zero chance of either of our teams losing lol,0,"based on the analysis of the language style and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""at least there's a good football game on"" is likely ironic, as the following part of the sentence contradicts the idea of it being a ""good"" game.

2. the comment about ""zero chance of either of our teams losing"" is sarcastic because it's impossible for both teams to not lose in a football game (unless it's a tie, which is rare and not typically considered a ""good"" game).

3. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end further emphasizes the humorous and non-serious nature of the statement.

4. the overall tone is self-deprecating about the performance of both teams mentioned, which is a common form of sarcasm.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this text.",1.0
"we are all the same race, HUMAN the only race supported by the Human Genome Project @CalFreedomMom @RBRNetwork1 @msnbc @CNN @dkuck15138",0,"not sarcastic

Throwing up is exactly what I want to be doing at 7:30am... 😷😷😷 #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. here's why:

1. the use of ellipsis (...) at the end of the sentence suggests a trailing off or pause, often used to indicate irony or sarcasm.

2. the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it's commonly used to negate the preceding statement, revealing that the true meaning is the opposite of what was literally said.

3. the content itself is inherently sarcastic. no one actually wants to be throwing up, especially early in the morning.

4. the use of the sick face emojis (😷😷😷) further emphasizes the unpleasantness of the situation, contrasting with the seemingly positive statement.

all these elements combined make it clear that the speaker is being sarcastic about wanting to throw up early in the morning.",1.0

Forest Hills Drive on my playlist naw....,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe the most appropriate label is:

4. the ellipsis at the end (....) could indicate trailing off or an incomplete thought, but doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm.
5. while the statement is brief and lacks context, it doesn't contain any obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, mock enthusiasm, or contrasting sentiments.

without additional context or tone indicators, this statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment about the speaker's music preferences.",0.0

1. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" is a direct indicator of sarcastic intent.
2. the phrase ""rubbing this on everyone's face"" is an idiom used here to mock the ministry of health's repetitive messaging about hand washing.
3. the question marks suggest a tone of disbelief or skepticism about the seemingly obvious advice.

Decemberbessen #not #fail #footprint sorry.... http://t.co/wsoYa1Wu1J,1,"based on the analysis of the cues provided, i believe i can make a reliable judgment on the sarcasm label for this text.

### label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of ""#not"" followed by ""#fail"" suggests a sarcastic tone. typically, when someone uses ""not"" in this context, they are implying the opposite of what they're saying.
2. the combination of ""sorry...."" with an ellipsis and the hashtags implies a lack of genuine apology, further supporting a sarcastic interpretation.
3. the contrast between ""decemberbessen"" (which seems positive) and the hashtags ""#fail #footprint"" creates an ironic juxtaposition typical of sarcasm.
4. the informal, social media style of writing is often associated with sarcastic or ironic comments, especially when combined with contradictory elements like we see here.

while the text is brief, the combination of these elements strongly suggests a sarcastic intent rather than a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement.",1.0
@onherperiod: hey sorry im late i didnt want to come #myperiod,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this tweet:

label: sarcastic

this tweet displays classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it uses a polite social convention (""hey sorry im late"") but immediately undercuts it with an honest, blunt statement (""i didnt want to come"").

2. the contrast between the expected apology and the unexpected honesty creates a humorous effect.

3. the hashtag #myperiod adds context that explains the reluctance to attend, but its casual addition to such a frank statement further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

4. the tweet plays with social expectations, using the format of a typical excuse but filling it with unexpected honesty, which is a common sarcastic technique.

the sarcasm here is subtle but clear, making light of social obligations and the discomfort of menstruation in a relatable and humorous way.",1.0

Not everyone's really for you no matter how long you knew them . And not everyone's a bad person just because it's been a short time. #irony,1,"based on the content of the text and the cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the presence of ""#irony"" at the end of the text is a strong indicator of sarcastic intent. the use of hashtags, especially ones that explicitly mention irony or sarcasm, is a common way for users to signal that their message should be interpreted as sarcastic.

2. the content of the message presents two contrasting ideas that challenge common assumptions about relationships and trust. this juxtaposition of ideas is often used in sarcastic or ironic statements.

3. the statement itself has a reflective, somewhat cynical tone about human relationships, which is often associated with sarcastic commentary on social dynamics.

4. while the punctuation is minimal, the use of the period mid-sentence and then again at the end creates a deliberate rhythm that can be interpreted as emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

given these factors, particularly the explicit use of ""#irony,"" it's reasonable to conclude that this text is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

the text is clearly sarcastic, as indicated by several cues:

1. the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag at the end of the tweet is the most obvious indicator.

2. the content presents contrasting ideas: it mentions that more people are in prison due to drug-related crimes, but then states that gun crime is up. this juxtaposition of seemingly contradictory information is often used in sarcastic statements.

3. the phrase ""but you know"" introduces a tone of irony, suggesting that the following statement should be interpreted in a non-literal way.

4. the informal, conversational style and use of twitter mentions (@proseish_2 @mcspocky) are consistent with the context where sarcasm is often employed on social media.

1. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as ironic or sarcastic.

2. the phrase ""problem solved"" followed by a simplistic solution (not reading out something) implies a mocking tone towards the situation or the people mentioned.

3. the overall context seems to be criticizing or mocking political communication practices, which is a common subject for sarcasm.

4. the informal tone and use of abbreviations (fmq, wm) in a political context also lends itself to a sarcastic interpretation.

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. here's why:

1. the statement ""today is going to be a great day"" is positive on its surface.

2. however, this positive statement is immediately contradicted by the hashtag ""#not"", which is a common way to indicate sarcasm or irony in online communication.

3. the sad face emoji (😔) further reinforces that the speaker's true feelings are opposite to the literal meaning of the words.

4. the combination of a positive statement followed by contradictory elements (hashtag and emoji) is a classic structure for sarcasm, especially in social media contexts.

5. the informal language and use of hashtags and emojis are also typical of sarcastic expressions in digital communication.

these elements together create a clear sarcastic tone, where the speaker is actually expressing that they expect the day to be bad, not great as literally stated. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this text.",1.0
@MTNza so apparently twitter is free... so why is my data being depleted using twitter? #not impressed,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. it starts with a statement presenting twitter as supposedly free (""apparently twitter is free""), setting up an expectation.

2. this is immediately followed by a contradictory observation (""why is my data being depleted using twitter?""), which undermines the initial statement.

3. the use of ""apparently"" suggests skepticism about the claim of twitter being free.

4. the hashtag ""#not impressed"" at the end reinforces the sarcastic tone, expressing disappointment and criticism.

these elements create a contrast between the expectation of a free service and the reality of data depletion, which is a classic structure for sarcasm. the author is using irony to criticize the notion that twitter is truly ""free"" when it consumes mobile data.",1.0

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tweet uses contrasting sentiments (""yes"" vs. ""no"") in a way that seems exaggerated or insincere.
2. the mention of making money on tsu (a lesser-known social media platform) in conjunction with auto-messagers and #followbackers suggests a mocking tone towards these practices.
3. the brevity and casual nature of the tweet, combined with the contradictory statements, align with common sarcastic patterns on social media.
4. the juxtaposition of seemingly approving auto-messagers (often considered spam) while disapproving of #followbackers (a common social media practice) further suggests a sarcastic intent.

these elements together indicate that the tweet is likely using sarcasm to critique or make light of certain social media practices and platforms.",1.0
@AndrewDBailey Tough crowd. Josh Smith was tremendous tonight.,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
while the phrase ""tough crowd"" could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic in some contexts, the overall tone and content of the message suggest that this is a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement. the author appears to be genuinely praising josh smith's performance (""josh smith was tremendous tonight"") while acknowledging that the crowd or other observers might have been critical or unappreciative (""tough crowd""). the contrast between these two elements doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm, but rather an observation of differing opinions. the use of the word ""tremendous"" to describe smith's performance seems sincere and positive, further supporting the non-sarcastic interpretation of the text.",0.0

this tweet is likely sarcastic for a few reasons:

@Dizzle729 ahh... the hill. I seem to remember (sort of) mud sliding down that hill at many a Buffet / Steve Miller concert. #GoodTimes,0,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reason for this judgment is:

1. the use of ""ahh..."" at the beginning suggests a nostalgic or reflective tone, which is often used in sarcastic reminiscence.

2. the phrase ""i seem to remember (sort of)"" implies a hazy recollection, which is often used in sarcastic or exaggerated storytelling.

3. the combination of ""mud sliding"" at a ""buffet / steve miller concert"" presents an unlikely or exaggerated scenario, which is typical of sarcastic humor.

4. the use of ""#goodtimes"" at the end can be interpreted as ironic, given the messy and potentially unpleasant nature of mud sliding.

5. the overall tone of the tweet suggests a playful, exaggerated recollection of past events, which is characteristic of sarcastic communication.

while the memories might be genuine, the way they are presented strongly suggests a sarcastic tone, likely poking fun at past concert experiences or the venue itself.",1.0
Please snow let us get out of dance early,0,"based on the comprehensive analysis provided in the current cues, i can confidently assign a label to this input text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the text ""please snow let us get out of dance early"" appears to be a genuine, hopeful plea rather than a sarcastic statement. the use of personification, addressing snow as if it could influence events, suggests a playful or whimsical tone, but not sarcasm. the emotional contrasts identified (desire vs. obligation, hope vs. reality) and the overall hopeful sentiment indicate sincerity rather than irony or mockery. the informal, conversational style and lack of punctuation are consistent with a casual, earnest request. there are no indicators of hidden meaning or contrary intent that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this input.",0.0
Why is there evidence of a stripper in my house yet I see no stripper in my house 😑💔 http://t.co/2KjUs8rotA,0,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the juxtaposition of finding evidence of a stripper without actually seeing a stripper present creates an absurd scenario that's meant to be humorous. the use of the unamused face emoji (😑) and broken heart emoji (💔) further emphasize the speaker's feigned disappointment and frustration with this ridiculous situation. the tone and structure of the tweet, combined with the emojis, strongly indicate sarcastic intent rather than a genuine inquiry or complaint.",1.0

How can u miss something u never had?||#randomthoughts #miss #irony |http://t.co/G5jLy9IKqn,1,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" based on the following considerations:

1. the use of irony: the hashtag #irony explicitly indicates the presence of irony in the statement.

2. rhetorical question: the text is phrased as a thought-provoking question that challenges logical expectations, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. paradoxical content: the question itself presents a paradox - missing something you never had - which is often used in sarcastic or ironic statements to highlight absurdity.

4. social media context: the informal language, use of hashtags, and brevity are typical of social media posts where sarcasm is frequently employed.

5. the combination of #randomthoughts and #irony suggests that the author is aware of the contradictory nature of the statement and is intentionally presenting it as a sarcastic observation.

given these cues and the content of the message, it's highly likely that this statement is meant to be interpreted as sarcastic rather than a genuine inquiry.",1.0
"#Mahathir, one of the godfathers of Asian values, Malaysians are ""stupid"", don't know how to run an airline #irony http://t.co/KzR6aAtrBo",1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of quotation marks around ""stupid"" suggests it's not a direct statement but likely a sarcastic reference.
2. the hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be understood as sarcastic or ironic.
3. the juxtaposition of mahathir being a ""godfather of asian values"" with the claim that malaysians are ""stupid"" creates a contradictory and likely sarcastic tone.
4. the overall context implies criticism of mahathir's statement through sarcasm, rather than a sincere agreement with the idea that malaysians are incapable.

therefore, the tweet is clearly meant to be understood as sarcastic commentary on mahathir's statement about malaysians.",1.0

the overall tone and content of the tweet indicate a sincere and enthusiastic sharing of a family moment, without any indicators of sarcasm or irony.",0.0
So baffled that WWE wrestling is still as popular as it is. All my friends went to the show in DC. I stopped watching like 12 years ago!,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. contrast: there's a clear contrast between the author's disinterest (having stopped watching 12 years ago) and the continued popularity among their friends and in general.

2. exaggeration: the use of ""all my friends"" is likely hyperbolic, emphasizing the widespread popularity in contrast to the author's stance.

3. tone: the exclamation at the end and the use of ""so baffled"" suggest an exaggerated sense of surprise or disbelief, which is often used in sarcastic expressions.

4. personal anecdote: the author uses their own experience to highlight the perceived absurdity of wwe's continued popularity.

5. implied criticism: while not explicitly stated, there's an underlying criticism of the ongoing popularity of something the author finds uninteresting, which is a common sarcastic approach.

these elements, combined with the emotional contrasts and rhetorical devices identified in the cues, strongly suggest that the text is sarcastic in nature, expressing incredulity at wwe's enduring popularity in a somewhat mocking tone.",1.0

Do you want to be right? |Or do you want to be happy?,0,"sarcastic

this text is likely sarcastic due to several key factors:

1. the contrasting emotional states presented (being ""right"" vs. being ""happy"") suggest an implied criticism of people who prioritize being correct over maintaining happiness or harmony.

2. the parallel structure and rhetorical questions create a mocking tone, implying that the choice should be obvious but some people foolishly choose being right over happiness.

3. the brevity and directness of the questions, along with the stark contrast presented, contribute to a sharp, witty tone often associated with sarcasm.

4. the implication that these are mutually exclusive choices is an oversimplification that's often used in sarcastic statements to highlight the absurdity of a situation or attitude.

the sarcasm here is subtle but present, using the rhetorical structure to critique the behavior of people who insist on being right at the expense of their own or others' happiness.",1.0
"I like to think of myself as a broken down Justin Bieber - my philosophy professor, everyone. #sarcasm",1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the statement is a clear indicator that the speaker intends the comment to be understood as sarcastic.

2. the content of the statement itself is absurd and unlikely to be meant literally. a philosophy professor comparing themselves to a ""broken down justin bieber"" is incongruous and humorous, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

3. the phrase ""i like to think of myself as..."" is often used in sarcastic or self-deprecating humor.

4. the juxtaposition of ""justin bieber"" (a pop star) with ""philosophy professor"" creates a stark contrast that enhances the sarcastic tone.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this text.",1.0

explanation:
the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm, particularly in the context of social media posting:

1. the contrast between the negative self-assessment (""i feel and look like shit"") and the unapologetic attitude (""#sorrynotsorry"") creates a sarcastic tone.

2. the use of hashtags, especially ""#sorrynotsorry,"" is often associated with a sarcastic or ironically defiant attitude on social media.

3. the hyperbole in ""look like shit"" combined with sharing this on social media (implied by the hashtags and image link) suggests a self-deprecating humor often associated with sarcasm.

4. the juxtaposition of admitting to looking bad while still choosing to post about it (and likely with a picture, given the image link) implies a level of irony typical of sarcastic posts.

5. the casual, colloquial language further reinforces the sarcastic tone, as it's often used in conjunction with ironic or sarcastic statements on social media.

2. the phrase ""monday morning inspiration"" is often used sarcastically, especially when paired with negative or cynical content.

3. the other hashtags like ""#donttrustnobody"" and ""#iwokeuplikethis"" contribute to a cynical or self-deprecating tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.

4. the combination of ""inspiration"" with negative sentiments creates a contradiction typical of sarcastic expressions.

5. the extracted keywords align with the content of the tweet and support the sarcastic interpretation.

sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

2. the use of ""likeee.."" suggesting a trailing off, implying the speaker knows it's a futile effort.
3. the humorous suggestion that chewing slower would somehow make it unnoticeable, which is unlikely to work.

Congress just screwed us but it's a great day in the District because we got another stadium! #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text for the following reasons:

1. content contradiction: the text begins by stating that ""congress just screwed us"" but then immediately claims it's a ""great day."" this stark contrast between a negative event and a positive reaction is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

2. use of exaggeration: describing getting ""another stadium"" as making it a great day, especially in the context of being ""screwed"" by congress, is an exaggerated positive reaction that doesn't match the severity of the negative situation mentioned.

3. hashtag usage: the text explicitly ends with ""#sarcasm"", which is a direct indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

4. punctuation: the use of the exclamation mark adds emphasis to the seemingly positive statement, which in this context enhances the sarcastic tone.

given these clear indicators, particularly the explicit #sarcasm hashtag, i can confidently label this text as ""sarcastic"" without needing further deliberation.",1.0
#AdvancedWarfare is so much better than any FPS released in 2014 XD,0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine expression of enthusiasm for the game ""advanced warfare"" rather than a sarcastic comment. here's why:

1. the language used is consistently positive, without any contrasting negative elements that might suggest sarcasm.

2. the use of hyperbole (""so much better than any fps released in 2014"") is common in genuine expressions of excitement about video games.

3. the ""xd"" emoticon at the end reinforces the positive sentiment, typically used to express genuine laughter or excitement in online communication.

4. the hashtag #advancedwarfare suggests the user is participating in a broader conversation about the game, which is more common for sincere praise than sarcasm.

5. there are no subtle linguistic cues or context clues that would indicate an ironic or sarcastic tone.

given these factors, the text appears to be a straightforward, enthusiastic endorsement of the game, and therefore should be labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

the text exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end contrasts with the implied criticism of the other person's knowledge.

2. the statement ""you're not familiar with matt busby, then"" is likely not a genuine question, but rather a rhetorical device implying that the person should know who matt busby is (a famous manchester united manager).

3. the contrast between the casual ""lol"" and the implied criticism creates a subtle mockery, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

4. the use of hashtags (#not, #with, #then) adds emphasis in a way that could be interpreted as exaggerating the point, another common sarcastic technique.

these elements combine to create a statement that says one thing on the surface (pointing out a lack of knowledge) while conveying a different meaning (criticism or mockery), which is the essence of sarcasm.",1.0

1. the use of ellipsis at the beginning and exclamation mark at the end creates a dramatic tone, often associated with sarcasm.

2. the hashtag-style writing mimics social media posts, where sarcasm is common.

3. the contrast between ""not usually a quitter"" and ""can do no more"" suggests an ironic situation where someone who doesn't quit is now at their limit.

4. the phrase ""only so much can be thrown at me"" implies an exaggerated sense of being overwhelmed, which is often expressed sarcastically.

5. the staccato rhythm created by the hashtags emphasizes each phrase, potentially adding to the sarcastic tone.

6. the overall sentiment of frustration and exhaustion, combined with the informal and colloquial language style, is conducive to sarcastic expression.

while it's possible this could be a genuine expression of frustration, the combination of these elements strongly suggests a sarcastic tone, likely mocking the idea of resilience in the face of overwhelming challenges.",1.0

Horray to working all weekend! #sarcasm #ohwell 💰💰👍😏,1,"based on the input text and the extracted cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this label is appropriate for several reasons:

1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be sarcastic.

2. the exclamation ""horray"" (likely meant to be ""hurray"") followed by ""working all weekend"" is a clear contradiction, as most people don't genuinely celebrate working through their time off.

3. the use of emojis, particularly the smirking face 😏, reinforces the sarcastic tone.

4. the hashtag ""#ohwell"" suggests a resigned attitude, further implying that the speaker is not actually happy about the situation.

5. the money bag emojis 💰💰 combined with the thumbs up 👍 in this context appear to be sarcastically implying that working all weekend is somehow worthwhile for the money, despite the obvious dissatisfaction.

all these elements together create a strongly sarcastic message, making the label ""sarcastic"" the correct choice.",1.0

"I do hope you Anti #GamerGate'rs will sleep better, knowing that sabotaging charities would make you more respectable in society. #sarcasm",1,"given the content and context of the input text, as well as the punctuation cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of exaggerated positive language (""i do hope"") followed by a clearly negative action (""sabotaging charities"") creates a stark contrast typical of sarcasm.

2. the implication that sabotaging charities would make someone ""more respectable in society"" is clearly meant to be taken as the opposite of its literal meaning.

3. the presence of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end of the tweet explicitly signals the author's sarcastic intent.

4. the overall tone and structure of the sentence are designed to mock and criticize the actions of ""anti #gamergate'rs"" through irony.

these factors, combined with the punctuation cues (especially the use of hashtags and apostrophe), strongly indicate that this text is indeed sarcastic.",1.0

the tweet is clearly sarcastic, pointing out the irony of a hazard worker training where participants are engaging in unhealthy behaviors (eating donuts and smoking) during breaks. the hashtags #fail, #nomealfitters, and #irony further emphasize the sarcastic tone, contrasting the unhealthy choices with fitness-oriented tags like @mealfit and @crossfit. the juxtaposition of a health and safety training with unhealthy practices is the core of the sarcasm in this tweet.",1.0

@AfterGrogBlog #pantsdowntiggy was his crime. Pixelation #moot or #irony,0,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of the hashtag ""#pantsdowntiggy"" suggests a mocking or humorous tone, likely referring to someone being caught in an embarrassing situation.
2. the presence of ""#irony"" as a hashtag is a strong indicator that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic or ironic.
3. the juxtaposition of ""crime"" with the seemingly trivial issue of pixelation adds to the sarcastic tone.
4. the use of multiple hashtags, particularly ""#moot"" and ""#irony"", suggests the author is commenting on the absurdity or pointlessness of a situation, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
5. while the text doesn't contain many explicitly emotional words, the overall structure and choice of words imply a sardonic or mocking attitude towards the subject matter.

#notcies #eu Green determined to block Hinkley Point - Green determined to block Hinkley Point Copyright EP 2013.... http://t.co/1koLDjISq3,0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward news headline or social media post about the green party's opposition to the hinkley point nuclear power project. there are no indicators of sarcasm present in the text. the language is direct and informational, typical of a news headline or brief social media update. the use of hashtags, truncated content, and inclusion of a url are common features of social media posts and don't suggest sarcasm in this context. therefore, based on the content and style of the text, it can be confidently labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

Love the fact that I turned off my alarm this morning and slept till so freaking late #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. here's why:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this hashtag is commonly used to negate the preceding statement, implying the opposite of what was said.

2. the phrase ""love the fact that"" followed by a description of an undesirable situation (oversleeping) is a classic sarcastic structure.

3. the use of ""freaking"" as an intensifier suggests frustration, which contrasts with the initial positive sentiment of ""love,"" further reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

4. the overall context implies that the speaker is actually upset about oversleeping, not happy about it as the literal words might suggest.

these elements combined create a clear sarcastic message, where the speaker is expressing their frustration about oversleeping in an ironic manner.",1.0

"#Seen #a #headline #about #a #doctor #that #starts #with #""Doctor #who...""? #Why #not #stick #your #head #in #the #toilet #and #pull #the...",0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. it mocks headlines starting with ""doctor who..."" by suggesting an absurd and unpleasant alternative action (sticking one's head in a toilet).

2. the implied comparison between reading such a headline and flushing one's head down a toilet is exaggerated and clearly not meant to be taken literally.

3. the ellipsis at the end (""pull the..."") leaves the reader to complete the thought, likely with ""flush,"" which adds to the sarcastic tone by not explicitly stating the full crude suggestion.

4. the overall structure and content of the tweet is designed to criticize and make fun of certain types of headlines in a hyperbolic manner, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate classification for this text.",1.0
"@SusanCalman @ClaireofThorpe Yet no ""dog in the manger"" that actually makes it a dog in a manger story #Irony",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input for the following reasons:

1. the use of the hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet is a strong indicator that the author intends the message to be understood as ironic or sarcastic.

2. the content of the tweet appears to be commenting on the absence of a key element (a ""dog in the manger"") in what is supposed to be a ""dog in a manger"" story. this points out a contradiction or absurdity, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

3. the language style information extracted indicates an informal, conversational tone and the use of sarcasm or irony, which aligns with the sarcastic intent.

4. while there isn't an obvious emotional contrast, the implicit contrast between expectation (a ""dog in the manger"" story should have a dog in a manger) and reality (the absence of this element) creates the basis for the sarcastic comment.

given these factors, particularly the explicit use of the #irony hashtag and the content pointing out an ironic situation, it's reasonable to conclude that this tweet is indeed sarcastic.",1.0

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be understood as sarcastic or ironic.

2. the contrast between the expected reason for not answering (thinking it's too early) and the claimed actual reason (calling to end the relationship) creates a unexpected twist that is characteristic of sarcasm.

3. the casual tone and exaggerated scenario (girls not answering because they think it's too early, but actually being called to be ""cut"") further supports the sarcastic nature of the statement.

4. the presence of keywords like ""irony"" in the extracted cues also supports this interpretation.

sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the message, coupled with the phrase ""of course"" at the beginning, strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic statement. the author is pointing out the irony in grayling's actions, suggesting that banning books in prisons is in line with also trying to ban judicial reviews. this creates a sharp contrast between actions that restrict freedoms (banning books) and attempts to limit legal processes that often protect rights (judicial reviews). the sarcasm lies in presenting these actions as if they were expected or logical, when in fact the author likely views them as contradictory to principles of justice and freedom.",1.0

sarcastic

the tweet is clearly using sarcasm to criticize someone's claim that waterboarding is not torture. the phrase ""you seem super smart"" is used sarcastically to mock the original tweet's assertion. the content of the original tweet, which attempts to justify waterboarding as not being torture because there's ""no bleeding,"" is a controversial and widely disputed claim. the sarcastic response highlights the absurdity of this argument by feigning admiration for such flawed reasoning.",1.0

2. the implication that getting cooked breakfast is suspicious behavior.
3. the phrase ""hes defo up to something"" indicates a humorous overreaction to a typically positive gesture.
4. the mix of emojis at the end (confused, surprised, and laughing faces) further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker doesn't actually believe there's anything sinister about getting breakfast cooked for them.

2. the crude sexual reference ""have a wank"" is used in a way that doesn't seem sincere, but rather to mock or ridicule.

3. the instruction to ""have a wank over this hashtag"" is absurd and likely meant to be humorous or mocking.

4. the use of multiple usernames and a hashtag in this context seems to be imitating or parodying typical social media behavior in an exaggerated way.

5. the overall tone and structure of the message is chaotic and doesn't convey a genuine sentiment, which is often characteristic of sarcastic or mocking posts on social media.

"If it's NOT? then it IS! Hand Crafted Artistically Fashionable, Connect @the3rdeyebrand for #fashionblog #thoughts http://t.co/s4PBUclKpm",0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics commonly associated with sarcasm:

1. the contrasting statement ""if it's not? then it is!"" uses exaggerated emphasis (capitalization and punctuation) to create a paradoxical or absurd tone.

2. the use of rhetorical questioning (""not?"") followed by an emphatic answer (""is!"") is a common sarcastic structure.

3. the overly enthusiastic and promotional tone, combined with buzzwords like ""hand crafted artistically fashionable,"" can be interpreted as mock sincerity.

4. the use of hashtags and social media conventions in a seemingly exaggerated manner (#fashionblog #thoughts) could be seen as satirizing typical social media marketing practices.

while the intent may be promotional, the exaggerated style and contradictory opening statement strongly suggest a sarcastic tone, likely poking fun at fashion industry clichés or social media marketing tactics.",1.0
It's okay @TicketmasterCA I didn't really want to see my idol anyway. #sarcasm,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

2. the content of the tweet itself expresses a sentiment that is opposite to what the speaker truly feels. saying ""it's okay"" and ""i didn't really want to see my idol anyway"" after presumably failing to get tickets is a classic sarcastic response.

3. the mention of @ticketmasterca suggests there was likely an issue with ticket purchasing, further supporting the sarcastic tone.

4. the use of punctuation, particularly the apostrophe and period, doesn't change the sarcastic nature but helps in conveying the tone.

therefore, this tweet is clearly sarcastic in nature.",1.0

5. the additional hashtag ""#imscared"" contradicts the ""wonderful"" sentiment, reinforcing the sarcastic nature of the statement.

Making the most out of my last vacation day. #not #tvandsleep,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. here's my reasoning:

1. the phrase ""making the most out of my last vacation day"" initially sounds positive and productive.

2. however, the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#tvandsleep"" directly contradict this sentiment:
   - ""#not"" is a common indicator of sarcasm, explicitly negating the previous statement.
   - ""#tvandsleep"" implies the person is actually spending their vacation day watching tv and sleeping, which is generally not considered ""making the most"" of a day off.

3. the contrast between the seemingly positive main statement and the contradictory hashtags creates a clear sarcastic tone.

4. this type of statement is a classic example of sarcasm, where someone says one thing but means the opposite, often for humorous effect or to express frustration.

given these elements, it's quite clear that the speaker is being sarcastic about how they're spending their last vacation day, likely implying that they're not actually making the most of it at all.",1.0
