 SHELDON: My apologies. What's your plan?
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the statement ""it's just a privilege to watch your mind at work"" appears to be a genuine expression of admiration from sheldon. the cues indicate that this is a sincere compliment about someone's intellect and problem-solving abilities. there's no evidence of contrasting emotions or hidden meanings that would suggest sarcasm. the use of the word ""privilege"" reinforces the idea that sheldon truly values and appreciates the opportunity to observe the other person's thought process. therefore, this statement is most likely meant to be taken at face value as a sincere compliment.",0.0

 PENNY: That sounds interesting.
 HOWARD: You'll think about it?
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""i don't think i'll be able to stop thinking about it"" appears to be a straightforward expression of concern or preoccupation. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the cues suggest that penny is genuinely expressing a persistent thought or worry, which is consistent with a non-sarcastic interpretation of the dialogue.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided information and context, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
the statement appears to be a straightforward offer from sheldon to give his epinephrine to someone else. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the text. the context suggests that sheldon is making a practical, matter-of-fact offer based on the current circumstances (it not being bee season). the tone seems neutral and the offer appears genuine, without any apparent contradiction or exaggeration that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, i believe this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 SHELDON: You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
 PENNY: Yes, I know, men can't fly.
 SHELDON: Let's assume that they can.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. while it uses a matter-of-fact tone and scientific language, it's applying these concepts to a fictional superhero scenario in an absurdly dark and humorous way. the contrast between the precise physics calculations and the gruesome outcome of lois lane being ""sliced into three equal pieces"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this type of humor, combining scientific accuracy with an outlandish superhero scenario, is characteristic of the character sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" known for his sarcastic and literal interpretations of pop culture concepts.",1.0

 SHELDON: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.
",BBT,1,"label: sarcastic

this line is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is making a witty, exaggerated observation about the state of the furniture. by suggesting that the coffee table is ""having a tiny garage sale,"" he's implying that there are many items cluttered on it, to the point where it resembles a sale. this is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous and sarcastic comment on the messy state of the room or the abundance of items on the coffee table.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the input and provided context, i would classify this as:

sarcastic

this appears to be a humorous, hypothetical scenario posed by howard to sheldon, likely from a sitcom or comedy show. the setup of imagining sheldon as an unknowing robot has a sarcastic, teasing tone typical of playful banter between characters. without reproducing any copyrighted material, i can say this type of dialogue is often used for comedic effect in fictional works, employing sarcasm to poke fun at a character's traits or behaviors.",1.0

sarcastic

the dialogue from sheldon contains clear sarcastic elements, including dark humor about a ""mix cd for a double suicide"" and a snide remark about a scratching post. these comments are not meant to be taken literally and exhibit the hallmark exaggeration and biting tone typical of sarcasm.",1.0

 SHELDON: Could you be more specific?
 LEONARD: Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
",BBT,1,"given the context provided and analyzing the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement by sheldon has a mocking tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.
2. there's an implied contrast between what's being said and what's meant. sheldon is saying the stains conceal something ""nicely,"" but the implication is that they're actually quite noticeable and unattractive.
3. the character sheldon (likely referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his sarcastic and often socially inappropriate comments.
4. the use of precise, clinical language (""dark crescent-shaped patterns"") to describe something as mundane as sweat stains adds to the sarcastic tone.
5. the statement appears to be a response to someone, likely in a situation where they're trying to hide or downplay their sweat stains, and sheldon is pointing out the obvious in a sardonic manner.

these factors strongly suggest that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward observation.",1.0

 SHELDON: Nothing.
 LEONARD: Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
",BBT,1,"based on the context and content provided, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

this quote appears to be sheldon's sincere attempt at an introduction, delivered in his characteristically blunt and socially inappropriate manner. while the statement is insulting, it seems to reflect sheldon's genuine thoughts rather than intentional sarcasm. sheldon often lacks awareness of social norms and expresses harsh criticisms directly, which is consistent with this quote.",0.0

 PERSON: Nice meeting you.
 PENNY: Yeah, you, too.
Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. leonard's statement employs irony to highlight the unintended negative consequences of his parents' well-meaning actions. the contrast between the positive intentions (giving a distinguished name and advanced education) and the negative outcome (increased bullying) is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. leonard is not literally stating that his parents wanted him to get beaten up more; rather, he's using sarcasm to express frustration with how their choices inadvertently made his social life more difficult.",1.0

 RAJ: and this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
 HOWARD: Guess whose parents just got broadband.
",BBT,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward introduction of raj's parents to leonard. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meaning in this statement. it's a formal and polite introduction, mentioning the full titles of raj's parents and their location. the context provided in the cues also supports this interpretation, suggesting this is likely a snippet from a script or dialogue where one character is simply introducing others via a video call. the tone is informative and respectful, without any hint of sarcasm.",0.0

 SHELDON: Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe this statement is likely sarcastic. here's my reasoning:

1. context: the cues suggest this is a quote from a character named sheldon, likely from a tv show or movie. sheldon characters are often known for their sarcastic or dry humor.

2. tone: the statement begins with ""well, i'm sorry, too,"" which seems insincere given the following rejection. this false apology is a common sarcastic device.

3. metaphorical language: the phrase ""no room for you in my wallet"" is likely not literal, but a metaphorical way of saying he won't provide financial support or include the person in his life. this kind of figurative language is often used in sarcastic comments.

4. bluntness: the cues describe the tone as ""blunt or dismissive,"" which aligns with a sarcastic delivery.

5. emotional contrast: while the cues don't explicitly mention emotional contrast, the fake apology followed by a rejection creates a subtle contrast that's characteristic of sarcasm.

given these factors, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to deliver a rejection in a humorous or pointed way, rather than expressing genuine regret. therefore, i believe the correct label is ""sarcastic.""",1.0

 RAJ: Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.
 LEONARD: Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

based on the available information and cues provided, the input text ""raj: i've got some feelers out. in the meantime, listen to this."" appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement. raj is simply informing someone that he's seeking information and wants to share something in the meantime. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or emotional contrasts that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems neutral and informative, consistent with normal conversation. therefore, the appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic"".",0.0

 PENNY: I know the reason.
 LEONARD: We all know the reason.
 LEONARD: Sheldon, what are you getting at?
",BBT,0,"based on the information provided and my analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of excitement and wonder from sheldon upon seeing someone who closely resembles a fictional character he admires. the use of phrases like ""beloved fictional character"" and ""come to life"" convey sincere amazement rather than sarcasm. sheldon's question ""how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?"" seems rhetorical and emphasizes his genuine surprise at the rare occurrence, rather than conveying any sarcastic undertones.",0.0

this statement from sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he uses an absurd, scientifically impossible scenario (a trash can spontaneously forming around the letter) as a contrast to the obvious explanation (someone threw it out). the mention of occam's razor, a principle that suggests the simplest explanation is usually correct, further emphasizes the sarcastic tone. sheldon is using exaggerated scientific concepts to humorously point out how ridiculous it would be to consider any explanation other than the obvious one.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward explanation of a feature or property.
2. there's no clear contrast between the literal meaning and an implied meaning.
3. the tone seems enthusiastic or demonstrative rather than mocking or ironic.
4. the exclamation point suggests genuine excitement about the reversible nature of the item or process being discussed.
5. the phrase ""technically, yes"" followed by additional information is typical of sincere, informative dialogue.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward response about a scientific publication.
2. there are no emotional contrasts or unexpected elements that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the context aligns with sheldon's character (likely from ""the big bang theory""), who is known for his genuine interest in physics.
4. the mention of a specific, technical publication (""applied particle physics quarterly"") is consistent with a factual, non-sarcastic statement.
5. there are no exaggerated or mocking tones that typically accompany sarcastic statements.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere response about receiving the latest copy of a scientific journal, which is in line with sheldon's character and interests.",0.0

 PENNY: Get anything good?
 SHELDON: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of ""oh, you know"" as an introductory phrase often sets up a sarcastic tone.
2. the word ""weird"" is highlighted in the cues as indicating surprise or confusion, but in this context, it's likely being used ironically.
3. the structure of the sentence, expressing surprise at a seemingly unlikely situation (one person's item arriving while the other's didn't), is a common pattern for sarcastic statements.
4. the cues mention that penny is responding to someone else's statement, suggesting this could be a reaction to someone boasting or mentioning they received their item.
5. without more context, the sarcasm seems to be implying that penny doesn't actually find it ""weird"" at all, but rather expected or unsurprising, possibly hinting at some underlying issue or unfairness.

while there's always a possibility of misinterpretation without fuller context, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that penny's statement is sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the analysis provided in the current cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the response ""no, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket!"" is clearly a sarcastic remark. howard's exaggerated and absurd comparison of his tongue swelling to the size of a brisket is a classic example of sarcasm used to emphasize his urgency and frustration with the situation. the contrast between the initial urgent ""now?!"" and the following sarcastic statement further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the overall comment.",1.0

 HOWARD: Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere.
 LEONARD: I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the first part of howard's statement seems to offer genuinely caring advice (""sit with her. hold her, comfort her.""), but then it abruptly shifts to an inappropriate and insensitive suggestion (""and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.""). this sudden contrast between seemingly sincere comfort and crude opportunism is a hallmark of sarcasm.

the sarcasm here lies in the juxtaposition of comforting someone in distress with trying to take sexual advantage of the situation. it's meant to shock and highlight the inappropriateness of such behavior, likely as a form of dark humor or commentary on howard's character (assuming this is from a script or dialogue).",1.0

sarcastic

this statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's using exaggerated language and mock formality to criticize someone's use of the word ""plenty"" to describe what he considers an insufficient quantity (just two of something). the sarcasm is evident in the hyperbolic suggestion to notify the oxford english dictionary about redefining a common word, which is not actually meant to be taken literally but rather to emphasize how absurd sheldon finds the use of ""plenty"" in this context.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward observation by sheldon about the clarity of communication at a table discussion.
2. there's no obvious contrast between what is said and what is meant, which is a common hallmark of sarcasm.
3. the cues mention that there are no clear emotional contrasts in the text, which would often be present in sarcastic statements.
4. the use of ""clear"" suggests directness and certainty, which aligns more with a literal interpretation rather than a sarcastic one.
5. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it seems sheldon is simply confirming that everyone at the table communicated clearly.

sarcastic

the statement by howard is clearly sarcastic. he's using exaggeration and contrast to highlight the perceived unfairness in resource allocation at his workplace. the comparison between someone else getting an assistant (a significant resource) and howard struggling to even get a pen (a basic supply) is deliberately extreme and not meant to be taken literally. the implication that he would need to rob a bank just to get a pen is a sarcastic way of emphasizing how difficult it is for him to obtain even simple office supplies, especially in contrast to others receiving more substantial benefits.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the statement itself is absurd and exaggerated. including an inhaler with a publication is not a standard practice, which suggests a non-literal, humorous intent.

2. the cues mention that this is likely a line from a tv show or movie, and specifically names sheldon, who is likely sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory."" this character is known for his dry wit and sarcastic remarks.

3. the suggestion of including an inhaler implies that the content is ""breathtaking"" or anxiety-inducing, which is likely an overstatement used for comedic effect.

4. the casual tone noted in the cues, combined with the unconventional suggestion, aligns with typical sarcastic humor.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the character's known personality, the absurdity of the statement, and the implied exaggeration all strongly point to this being a sarcastic remark.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the contrast between ""sadly"" and ""lucky"" creates an ironic tone.
2. howard's statement about liking ""fashion models pruny and bug-eyed"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally, as these are generally not considered attractive features.
3. the exaggerated description of chlorine's effects (pruny and bug-eyed) further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.
4. the juxtaposition of mrs. wolowitz's sensitivity with howard's professed preference creates a humorous and sarcastic effect.

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of sheldon's personal rule about his food, without any ironic or sarcastic undertones. the character is directly stating his strong preference, which aligns with what we know about sheldon's personality and quirks. the phrase ""the big deal is"" emphasizes the seriousness with which he views this rule, but it doesn't introduce any contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, based on the context and the direct nature of the statement, this can be confidently labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

the response ""where do you think? on mars!"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. howard is using an exaggerated, impossible location (mars) to emphasize how obvious he thinks the answer should be. this type of rhetorical question followed by an absurd suggestion is a common sarcastic technique. the tone of exasperation noted in the cues further supports this interpretation.",1.0

this statement appears to be a straightforward recounting of actions taken by the speaker. the tone suggests urgency and secrecy, but there's no indication of irony or sarcasm. the speaker is describing their actions in a direct manner, without any apparent contradiction or exaggeration that would typically signal sarcasm. the language used (""discreetly,"" ""got the hell out of there"") aligns with the described actions and doesn't seem to be used in a way that would subvert their literal meaning.",0.0

sarcastic

the contrast between leonard's apparent frustration and the casual way he phrases a violent suggestion strongly indicates sarcasm. the question about punching someone in the face is not likely meant literally, but rather as a sarcastic expression of annoyance or exasperation. this kind of hyperbolic, darkly humorous statement is a common form of sarcasm, especially in sitcom-style dialogue.",1.0

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the provided information and context, this statement appears to be a straightforward, factual recounting of an event. sheldon is simply stating that his aunt marion gave him something (presumably the item being discussed) for his 12th birthday. there are no indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory emotions. the sentence is delivered in a neutral tone, consistent with sheldon's character if this is from ""the big bang theory"" tv show. without any additional context suggesting otherwise, this statement should be taken at face value as a non-sarcastic comment about receiving a birthday gift.",0.0

",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine suggestion from raj rather than a sarcastic comment. he's proposing an alternative activity (building a bear) if the current situation isn't enjoyable. the tone is straightforward and the suggestion is practical, given the context of a nearby build-a-bear workshop or similar store. there's no evident irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would typically indicate sarcasm. therefore, based on the provided information and context, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
"LEONARD: - Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like ""yoga.""","PERSON: Leonard. Come, join us.

 PENNY: Dave was just showing me around the university. This place is unbelievable!
 LEONARD: I know, I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the response ""sarcastic"" is appropriate here for several reasons:

1. context: the cues indicate this is likely part of a humorous or lighthearted exchange involving potential miscommunication.

2. exaggeration: leonard's claim that ""a lot of words sound like 'yoga'"" is an obvious exaggeration. in reality, there aren't many words that sound similar to ""yoga,"" making this statement hyperbolic.

3. feigned misunderstanding: leonard is likely pretending to have misheard something to avoid or deflect from the actual topic (yoga), which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. tone implication: while we can't hear the tone, the structure of the sentence suggests a deadpan or dry delivery, which is often associated with sarcasm.

5. social context: in sitcoms or casual conversations, this kind of response is typically delivered with a sarcastic intent for comedic effect.

the combination of these factors strongly suggests that leonard's statement is meant to be taken as sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the given information and the nature of the statement, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally. it's a sarcastic suggestion that highlights the absurdity of swimming on the floor, likely in response to someone's complaint or difficulty with actual swimming. this kind of exaggerated, impractical proposal is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.",1.0

 SHELDON: The learning opportunities would be abundant.
 SHELDON: Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.
",BBT,1,"given the input and the cues provided, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement ""i hope i'm a waitress at the cheesecake factory for my whole life"" is almost certainly sarcastic. here's why:

1. context: waitressing at a chain restaurant like the cheesecake factory is typically viewed as a temporary or transitional job, not a lifelong career aspiration.

2. use of ""hope"": the use of ""hope"" here is ironic. people generally hope for career advancement or finding their passion, not remaining in an entry-level position indefinitely.

3. ""whole life"": this extreme time frame adds to the sarcastic tone. it's uncommon and generally undesirable to remain in the same entry-level job for one's entire life.

4. character context: if this is penny from ""the big bang theory"" (which seems likely given the character name and job), she often uses sarcasm and is known to be dissatisfied with her waitressing job.

the cues provided also support this interpretation, noting the likely sarcastic or ironic tone and the improbability of someone genuinely expressing this sentiment. therefore, labeling this statement as ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation: while the statement could potentially be interpreted as playful or teasing, there's no clear indication of sarcasm in leonard's words. he appears to be genuinely encouraging someone to elaborate on a secret romantic situation between two other people. the tone seems more gossipy or curious rather than sarcastic. without additional context that might suggest an ironic or mocking intent, it's safer to interpret this statement as straightforward and not sarcastic.",0.0

 PERSON: The big wet ball of death.
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

rationale:
1. the statement ""kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?"" appears to be a genuine question or observation about an experience that is energizing or invigorating.
2. the emotional words identified (""feel"" and ""alive"") suggest a positive, heightened emotional state without any apparent contradiction or irony.
3. there's no clear indication of contrasting emotions or underlying negativity that would typically be present in sarcastic statements.
4. the question seems to be seeking agreement or confirmation about a shared positive experience, which is more consistent with sincere communication rather than sarcasm.

while context is limited, the straightforward nature of the question and the positive sentiment it expresses align more closely with a non-sarcastic interpretation.",0.0

 LEONARD: That does sound much simpler.
 LEONARD: How long is this going to take?
",BBT,1,"label: sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the provided cues and context. sheldon's response exhibits classic sarcastic traits:

1. the excessively precise time estimate (3 hours, 11 minutes) is likely an overstatement for comedic effect.

2. the phrase ""fairly pointless conversation"" is dismissive and implies frustration, which is characteristic of sarcastic remarks.

3. sheldon's character is known for his dry wit and often sarcastic responses, especially when he feels a conversation is beneath him intellectually.

4. the overall tone is impatient and dismissive, which aligns with the use of sarcasm as a way to express irritation or superiority.

these factors strongly indicate that sheldon's statement is intended to be sarcastic, using exaggeration and dismissive language to convey his annoyance with the current conversation.",1.0

 HOWARD: You know the old saying, ""Pasty and frail never fail.""
",BBT,0,"based on the input and the provided cues, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration and feeling left out.
2. leonard is directly questioning why he's not being included, which seems to be a sincere concern.
3. the phrasing ""excuse me"" and ""why don't i get a shot?"" indicate a straightforward request for consideration, rather than a sarcastic remark.
4. there's no apparent irony or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm.
5. the cues consistently interpret this as a sincere expression of feeling overlooked or excluded, without mentioning any sarcastic undertones.

therefore, the statement appears to be a non-sarcastic expression of leonard's genuine feelings and desire to be included.",0.0

 LEONARD: The box says ""kitchen.""
",BBT,1,"based on the provided context and the line of dialogue, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's using an exaggerated comparison to cocaine smugglers to make a point, likely about not overtly labeling something. the rhetorical question format and the absurd nature of the example (cocaine smugglers explicitly labeling their illegal goods) are strong indicators of sarcasm. sheldon is using this sarcastic remark to highlight the ridiculousness of expecting something secretive or illicit to be openly labeled.",1.0

3. the context suggests leonard is genuinely trying to resolve a situation by encouraging someone to join them.

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement ""you think 'coffee,' means coffee. that is so sweet."" is clearly sarcastic. penny is using a condescending tone to point out someone's simplistic understanding of coffee. the phrase ""that is so sweet"" is often used sarcastically to imply that someone's naivety or ignorance is almost endearing, but in a patronizing way. this aligns with the cues about a misunderstanding of coffee terminology and the implication that there are more complex meanings or varieties of coffee that the person penny is addressing is unaware of.",1.0

explanation:
leonard's statement ""hardly a day goes by when i don't think about it"" appears to be a sincere expression of frequent thoughts about a past event or experience. the tone suggests a genuine, ongoing preoccupation with something significant. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would typically characterize sarcasm. the emotional words and overall context support a straightforward, honest admission of persistent reflection or concern, rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

sarcastic

the statement by leonard is clearly sarcastic. he's not sincerely suggesting a tableau, but rather using biting sarcasm to express hostility or frustration towards the person he's speaking to. the violent imagery of ""trying to pummel you to death"" is likely an exaggerated, sarcastic response to something the other person said or did.",1.0

 SHELDON: Comforting is a part of leadership.
It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the context of the dialogue, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of ""terrific"" at the beginning of leonard's statement is clearly sarcastic. the immediate contrast between this seemingly positive exclamation and the hesitation that follows (""it's just that..."") followed by the revelation that penny likely doesn't want him to go indicates that leonard is not genuinely enthusiastic. instead, he's using sarcasm to express his frustration or disappointment with the situation. this kind of verbal irony, where the literal meaning (terrific) contrasts with the intended meaning (not terrific at all), is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe the most appropriate label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the question appears to be a genuine inquiry from leonard seeking clarification about a previous statement.
2. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony in the phrasing.
3. the emotional context suggests sincerity, with leonard trying to understand the meaning behind someone saying they would miss him.
4. the question implies a straightforward desire for information rather than any attempt at humor or mockery typically associated with sarcasm.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of interest from sheldon about wanting to visit a goth nightclub. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggerated tone, contradictory context, or ironic elements. the phrase ""i've always wanted to"" suggests a genuine, long-held curiosity rather than a sarcastic remark. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's reasonable to interpret this statement as sincere and not sarcastic.",0.0

 LEONARD: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. context: sheldon is known for over-analyzing simple situations, which is part of his character's humor in the show.

2. overstatement: describing waitressing as a ""complex socio-economic activity"" is a dramatic exaggeration of the job's complexity.

3. incongruity: the mismatch between the simplicity of waitressing and the high-level analysis sheldon suggests it requires creates a humorous contrast.

4. tone: the use of words like ""obviously"" and ""great deal of analysis and planning"" for a relatively straightforward job adds to the sarcastic tone.

5. character consistency: this aligns with sheldon's typical behavior of applying unnecessarily complex reasoning to everyday situations, which is often used for comedic effect in the show.

the sarcasm here is not meant to belittle waitressing, but rather to highlight sheldon's characteristic tendency to overcomplicate things, which is a running joke in the series.",1.0

the comment from sheldon exhibits classic sarcasm. he's making a dry, understated observation about sexual intercourse that implies it's not worth the effort, which goes against typical societal views. this kind of deadpan commentary on a topic that most people consider highly desirable or important is a hallmark of sarcastic humor, especially coming from a character like sheldon who is known for his logical and often socially oblivious perspective.",1.0

 BERNADETTE: That's amazing.

",BBT,1,"label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is comparing leonard's scientific work, which is presumably complex and advanced, to a very simple elementary school science experiment. by saying leonard's work is ""nearly as amazing"" as the lima bean experiment, sheldon is actually implying that leonard's work is trivial or unimpressive. 

the sarcasm is particularly evident because:

1. sheldon, known for his intelligence and high standards in science, is unlikely to genuinely be impressed by a third-grade experiment.

2. the comparison is absurdly disproportionate - professional scientific research versus a child's basic school project.

3. the phrase ""nearly as amazing"" is a classic sarcastic construction, used to mock something by comparing it unfavorably to something obviously simple or unimpressive.

this statement is a prime example of sarcasm used to belittle someone's work by drawing an exaggerated, unflattering comparison.",1.0

 LEONARD: ""Tushy face. "" Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the context indicates that bernadette is genuinely excited about leonard's experiment.
2. the emotional tone is positive and enthusiastic, as evidenced by her use of the word ""cool.""
3. the topic is consistent with a scientific discussion, which aligns with the characters' backgrounds and interests.
4. there's no indication of contrasting emotions or hidden meanings that would suggest sarcasm.
5. the statement is a straightforward expression of admiration for a scientific observation, which is in line with bernadette's character as a scientist.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of interest in leonard's experiment and not a sarcastic remark.",0.0

 PENNY: Oh,it's not a problem.
",BBT,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

### label:
sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic because it humorously exaggerates the idea of emotional stability being necessary for a presumably simple task. the speaker is probably not actually referring to heavy machinery, but rather using this phrase ironically to imply that the task at hand is much less serious or dangerous than operating heavy machinery. this creates a comedic contrast between the presumed simplicity of the actual task and the extreme caution suggested for ""heavy machinery,"" making the statement sarcastic in nature.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward comment from penny about a previous conversation. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. penny seems to be genuinely expressing that a topic has been sufficiently discussed, thanks to leonard's explanation during a car ride. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than sarcastic.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

the use of the word ""overreaction"" and leonard's questioning tone strongly suggest that he's employing sarcasm to critique someone's decision to look for a new city to live in. leonard implies that this action is excessive, which is a common hallmark of sarcastic commentary. the structure of the sentence, framing it as a question beginning with ""don't you think,"" is also a typical sarcastic rhetorical device used to emphasize the speaker's point.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the input and the provided cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is presented as a broad generalization about jewish cultural preferences, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic humor.
2. the cues mention that this is likely a humorous reference to a well-known cultural stereotype.
3. the phrasing ""jews always go with chinese food"" is an exaggeration, which is common in sarcastic statements.
4. the context suggests this is part of a conversation or joke, indicating it may not be meant to be taken literally.
5. while not explicitly emotional, the casual tone and use of cultural stereotyping for humor aligns with sarcastic communication styles.

therefore, considering these factors, the statement appears to be a sarcastic comment playing on cultural stereotypes for comedic effect.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this response from penny is clearly meant to be a humorous, sarcastic comment implying that the person she's talking to might be an alien secretly studying humans. the exaggerated nature of her explanation (mentioning ""alien overlords"" and discovering human weaknesses) is a strong indicator of sarcasm, aligning with the cues about this being a joke or sarcastic comment about aliens studying humans.",1.0

 SHELDON: There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

the line ""why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?"" appears to be a straightforward question without any obvious indicators of sarcasm. howard seems to be genuinely inquiring about the storage location of certain items. without additional context that might suggest an ironic or mocking tone, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a sincere question about household organization. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this input.",0.0

 PERSON: I see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited?
 SHELDON: You said we were invited.
",BBT,0,"based on the given input and the current cues, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward clarification by penny about an invitation.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the context seems to be a genuine invitation to visit stan lee's house, which is likely an exciting prospect given stan lee's fame in the comic book world.
4. the tone of the clarification (""oh, no, no"") suggests penny is earnestly trying to correct a misunderstanding, rather than making a sarcastic remark.
5. there are no emotional words or contrasts that might indicate a sarcastic intent.

therefore, the statement appears to be a sincere clarification and invitation, not a sarcastic comment.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the context and tone of penny's statement suggest a sarcastic remark. she's not genuinely inquiring about a new girlfriend or suggesting one is needed. instead, the comment implies a teasing or provocative tone, likely in response to some situation or behavior she's observed. the phrasing ""you might need one"" particularly hints at sarcasm, as it's not a sincere recommendation but rather a pointed comment that could be implying criticism or mockery of the person she's addressing.",1.0

2. the emotional word ""glad"" is identified, indicating a positive sentiment without any hint of sarcasm.
3. there's no indication of contrasting emotions or hidden meanings that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the brief nature of the statement and the direct address (""you."") at the end aligns more with a straightforward, sincere response rather than a sarcastic one.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, there are no clear markers here to suggest that leonard's statement is anything other than a genuine expression of appreciation for how something was phrased or asked.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation: leonard's request appears to be a genuine and straightforward attempt to change the subject of conversation. while there's a slight hint of exasperation in his tone, especially with the phrase ""vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet,"" this doesn't rise to the level of sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a sincere request to discuss more relatable or everyday topics, which aligns with the cue provided about changing the subject to something more relevant to everyday life. the statement is direct and lacks the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm.",0.0

 SHELDON: Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.
 LEONARD: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
 HOWARD: Yeah, since when do you take walks?
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be genuine rather than sarcastic. sheldon is sharing information he learned from a study and expressing his sincere interest in the benefits, particularly the increase in serotonin. his comment about liking serotonin more than a refreshing beverage is consistent with his character's typical enthusiasm for scientific facts and bodily functions. the ""bye-bye"" at the end suggests he's likely leaving to go for a walk after eating, which aligns with the information he just shared. there are no contradictory elements or tonal shifts that would indicate sarcasm in this context.",0.0

### label: sarcastic

this statement is sarcastic because:

1. sheldon is using exaggerated language (""cornucopia of social awkwardness"") to describe someone's behavior.
2. the phrase ""he does it all the time"" suggests a repetitive pattern that sheldon finds notable or amusing.
3. sheldon's character is known for his own social awkwardness, so his pointing out this trait in others often comes with a layer of irony.
4. the use of ""cornucopia,"" which means an abundance or overflowing supply, is a deliberately over-the-top metaphor for social awkwardness, indicating sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is subtle and dry, typical of sheldon's character, where he's making a humorous observation about someone else's social ineptitude while likely being unaware of his own similar traits.",1.0

3. the comparison to experiences with his mother seems to be offered sincerely as a relatable example.
4. the tone appears to be lighthearted and matter-of-fact rather than mocking or ironic.
5. the words ""accidentally"" and ""happens"" support the idea that howard is discussing a plausible, unintentional occurrence.

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of happiness for someone who has found a good romantic partner. the use of ""glad"" and describing the partner as ""a keeper"" indicate sincere positive sentiment. there are no obvious contextual cues or tone indicators that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems straightforward and supportive, expressing relief or satisfaction that the person has finally found a suitable partner, possibly after some difficulty or time. without additional context that might contradict this interpretation, it's reasonable to conclude that this statement is not sarcastic.",0.0

this text is clearly sarcastic. howard's tone and word choice (""science dudes,"" ""our friend the beaver"") suggest he's not genuinely proposing serious scientific topics for discussion. instead, he's mocking or belittling the idea of a scientific conversation by listing stereotypical, elementary-level science subjects in a dismissive manner. the sarcasm is evident in how he reduces complex scientific fields to simplistic, almost childish topics, implying that this is all ""science dudes"" might want to discuss.",1.0

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" for the following reasons:

1. character context: sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"" is known for his sarcastic and often socially inappropriate comments. his deadpan delivery often masks the sarcastic intent of his statements.

2. exaggeration: the statement implies that whatever is being discussed only belongs in the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, which is likely an exaggeration meant to emphasize how childish or immature sheldon considers the item or topic.

3. contrast with sheldon's character: as a highly intelligent adult scientist, sheldon's suggestion that something belongs in a child's bedroom creates a humorous contrast with his usual demeanor and interests.

4. implied criticism: the statement is likely meant to criticize or mock whatever is being discussed by associating it with young girls' interests, which sheldon probably considers beneath him.

5. tone: while not explicitly stated in the cues, the typical delivery of such lines by sheldon in the show is with a dry, matter-of-fact tone that belies the sarcastic content.

without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact object of sheldon's sarcasm, but the structure and delivery of the line strongly suggest it is meant to be a sarcastic comment rather than a sincere statement.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a fragment of a conversation without full context.

3. there are no clear emotional contrasts or exaggerated statements that might indicate sarcasm.
4. the tone seems neutral to slightly uncertain, without any obvious sarcastic undertones.
5. the phrase ""yeah, sure. why not you?"" could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic in some contexts, but without more information, it seems more likely to be a genuine, if somewhat reluctant, agreement or suggestion.

",BBT,0,"label: sarcastic

this statement appears to be sarcastic based on several factors:

1. the use of ""obviously"" at the beginning suggests a tone of exaggeration or mock seriousness.

2. the abrupt jump from being a ""justice league"" to needing to switch to ""muppet baby costumes"" is an extreme and unlikely scenario, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

3. the character sheldon is known for his deadpan delivery and often sarcastic remarks in popular culture (likely referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"").

4. the juxtaposition of the adult superhero team (justice league) with childish characters (muppet babies) creates a humorous contrast that's typical of sarcastic comments.

5. the statement implies an overreaction to a situation, suggesting that changing to muppet baby costumes is the only logical next step after no longer being a justice league, which is absurd and therefore likely sarcastic.

given these elements, the statement is most likely intended to be humorous and sarcastic rather than a sincere suggestion.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the contrast between the formal act of discussing research over dinner and the casual nature of fast food, combined with sheldon's dismissive tone, clearly indicates sarcasm in this statement. sheldon is mocking the idea of spending an entire dinner discussing someone's research by comparing it to a quick fast-food experience, which creates the ironic juxtaposition typical of sarcastic remarks.",1.0

 PERSON: Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.
",BBT,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is absurd and illogical - one cannot ""forbid"" someone to have sex while they are sleeping.
2. the use of the non-standard word ""forboded"" (likely meant to be ""forbade"") adds to the nonsensical nature of the statement, which is often a feature of sarcasm.
3. the context suggests this is part of a fictional or hypothetical conversation, where sarcasm is more likely to occur.
4. the statement implies an unreasonable level of control over another person's actions, which is often exaggerated for sarcastic effect.

while we don't have full context, the absurdity and exaggeration in this statement strongly suggest it is meant to be sarcastic rather than a sincere declaration.",1.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. penny's response ""oh, yeah, yeah. it's real great"" is dripping with sarcasm, followed by a description of a frustrating and potentially embarrassing situation. the contrast between her initial positive-sounding words and the disappointing reality she describes is a classic hallmark of sarcasm.

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward, positive remark about living in the present time.

3. there are no apparent contrasts or contradictions in the statement that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the cues don't indicate any contextual information that would imply this statement is meant ironically or sarcastically.

 BERNADETTE: Leonard's really one of a kind.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided input and cues, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

sarcastic

the statement by amy contains elements typical of sarcasm:

1. irony: amy is pointing out that someone's action (holding a snowflake while making a statement) is overly obvious or exaggerated in its symbolism.

2. critical tone: the phrase ""a bit heavy-handed"" is a criticism delivered in a understated way, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

3. rhetorical question: ending with ""don't you think?"" invites agreement in a way that's often used in sarcastic comments.

4. implied mockery: amy is subtly mocking the person's attempt at symbolism or making a point, suggesting it's too obvious or lacking in subtlety.

while the statement itself isn't aggressively sarcastic, it uses a mild form of sarcasm to criticize someone's actions or words. the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the seemingly polite phrasing and the underlying criticism.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this input is:

not sarcastic

the speaker (person3) appears to be genuinely surprised or confused about sheldon buying a loom and learning to weave. the use of ""i'm sorry"" in this context seems to be an expression of disbelief or a request for clarification, rather than a sarcastic remark. the question is straightforward and seeks confirmation about an unexpected situation, without any apparent irony or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the context information provided and the content of penny's statement, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

this label is appropriate because:

1. penny claims she's not concerned, but her subsequent comments contradict this assertion.
2. she makes a pointed remark about leonard's new girlfriend ""wearing way too much makeup,"" which implies she is indeed bothered by the situation.
3. the sudden shift to talking about cute items she can't afford adds to the sarcastic tone.
4. her hyperbolic comment about renting out her womb to afford the items is a clear use of sarcastic humor.

these elements combine to create a statement that is heavily laden with sarcasm, despite penny's initial claim of not being concerned.",1.0

 RAJ: Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other.
 BERNADETTE: You guys ready to order?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the line appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the unusual combination of requests: antibiotics, a vomiting inducer, and a mint don't typically go together, creating a humorous contrast.

2. the casual tone: sheldon's matter-of-fact delivery of this odd list, especially ending with ""and a mint,"" suggests a deadpan or sarcastic tone.

3. context clues: sheldon is a character known for his quirky and often socially inappropriate behavior. this request fits that pattern and is likely meant to be humorous.

4. the incongruity: asking for medication to induce vomiting alongside a mint creates a funny juxtaposition that's characteristic of sarcasm.

5. the precision: specifying a ""seven-day course"" of penicillin adds a level of unnecessary detail that often accompanies sarcastic statements.

given these elements, the statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic, using humor to highlight sheldon's peculiar character traits.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement ""oh, yeah, that can only be good for you"" is clearly sarcastic. raj is implying the opposite of what he's saying - in reality, this situation of a current girlfriend and an ex-girlfriend hanging out together is likely to be awkward or problematic for the person involved. the use of ""oh, yeah"" and the exaggerated positive assertion ""can only be good"" are strong indicators of sarcasm in this context.",1.0

",BBT,1,"given the clear use of the word ""sarcastically"" in sheldon's statement, as well as the context and tone of his response, i can confidently label this input as:

the label for this input is ""sarcastic."" 

this judgment is based on several cues in sheldon's statement:

1. the phrase ""welcome temporarily aboard"" is somewhat contradictory and suggests a lack of genuine enthusiasm.

2. the comment about leonard being ""too cool to wear"" the lapel pin is clearly sarcastic. it implies disapproval of leonard's choice while framing it as if leonard thought he was above wearing the pin.

3. the overall tone of the statement, while seemingly welcoming on the surface, has an undercurrent of criticism and insincerity, particularly in the final sentence.

4. the contrast between the formal welcome and the snide remark about leonard creates a sarcastic undertone to the entire statement.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic tone, where sheldon is using ostensibly positive language to convey a more critical or dismissive attitude.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. amy's comment about seeing someone as ""the face of hemorrhoids"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's a mocking or teasing remark, likely intended to be humorous in a biting way. associating someone with an embarrassing medical condition like hemorrhoids is a classic example of sarcastic humor, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning. amy is not sincerely suggesting the person would be a good spokesperson for hemorrhoids, but rather making a jab at their expense.",1.0

this statement appears to be sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the contrast between perceiving betrayal in others while being blind to one's own betraying actions creates irony, which is a common element in sarcasm.

2. the statement points out a contradiction in someone's behavior, highlighting their hypocrisy in a subtle yet critical way.

3. the context of this being a line from sheldon, a character known for his dry and often sarcastic remarks, further supports this interpretation.

4. the brevity and directness of the statement, combined with its insightful observation about human nature, aligns with typical sarcastic commentary.

the response ""oh, that would be mighty white of you"" is a clear example of sarcasm. leonard first states that they don't say certain things and offers to make a list, but then immediately uses a phrase that would likely be on that list of inappropriate sayings. the irony in using an outdated, potentially offensive phrase right after offering to list things they shouldn't say indicates a sarcastic tone. the contrast between the initial helpful offer and the subsequent use of problematic language further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the exchange.",1.0

### explanation:
based on the cues provided and the content of howard's statement, this appears to be a genuine expression of excitement and awe rather than sarcasm. the key points supporting this judgment are:

1. the context indicates that howard is genuinely talking about an upcoming trip to the international space station.
2. the exclamation ""oh, my word"" and the phrase ""a trip to the heavens"" convey genuine excitement and reverence for the opportunity.
3. space travel is widely considered a significant and exciting event, making howard's enthusiasm appropriate and sincere.
4. there are no contradictory or ironic elements in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.
5. the emotional contrasts noted (excitement/elation and awe/reverence) are consistent with the extraordinary nature of space travel, further supporting the sincerity of the statement.

given these factors, it's highly likely that howard is expressing genuine excitement about his upcoming space trip, and therefore, the statement is not sarcastic.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

this statement appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the character sheldon is known for his dry, often sarcastic humor (particularly if this is from the tv show ""the big bang theory"").

2. the statement exaggerates the significance of a very subtle reaction (slightly widened eyes), treating it as if it's something remarkable or noteworthy.

3. there's an ironic contrast between the understated physical reaction (slightly widened eyes) and the dramatic way sheldon describes it (""nothing quite like"").

4. the phrase ""mildly startled"" is an oxymoron of sorts, as being startled typically implies a strong reaction, while ""mildly"" downplays it. this contradiction adds to the sarcastic tone.

5. the formal structure of the sentence, beginning with ""yes, there's nothing quite like..."" is often used in sarcastic or ironic statements to mock enthusiasm for something mundane or unremarkable.

given these factors, the statement is most likely meant to be interpreted sarcastically rather than as a sincere observation.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the character sheldon is expressing genuine surprise and self-criticism upon realizing he has been deceived. the dialogue shows a sincere reaction rather than a sarcastic one. sheldon's realization that ""this was all a ruse"" and his self-admonishment ""oh, how could i be so stu..."" (likely cutting off ""stupid"") indicate genuine dismay and disappointment in himself for not seeing through the deception earlier. this straightforward expression of shock and self-criticism is not consistent with sarcasm, which would typically involve saying the opposite of what one means in a mocking or insincere tone.",0.0

sarcastic

the statement by bernadette is clearly sarcastic. the phrase ""if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone"" is a mocking comparison, and the use of ""great"" at the end is not sincere approval but rather a sarcastic way of expressing disapproval or criticism of someone's appearance or choice of clothing. this aligns perfectly with the cues provided, which identify the sarcastic use of ""great"" and the overall critical tone of the statement.",1.0

 LEONARD: Yeah, that's not it.
 LEONARD: Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone of the statement appears genuinely fascinated or intrigued, as indicated by the use of ""very interesting"" and the sharing of an unusual fact.
2. there's no apparent contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
3. the information provided, while unusual, is presented as a factual statement without any obvious irony or mockery.
4. sheldon's character (if this is from ""the big bang theory"") is often known for his straightforward communication and fascination with unusual facts, making this statement consistent with his typical non-sarcastic manner.
5. the cues mention that there isn't a clear emotional contrast in the text, which further supports a non-sarcastic interpretation.

therefore, the statement appears to be a genuine expression of interest rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

the statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic, combining a seemingly innocuous reference to the holidays with a crude anatomical joke. this type of humor, blending mundane observations with unexpected and often inappropriate comments, is characteristic of sarcasm, especially as it's typically employed by sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory.""",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement by penny appears to be a genuine expression of mild disappointment.
2. the phrase ""that's too bad"" is a common, sincere way to express regret or disappointment.
3. the reference to ""waiting for the ball to drop"" on new year's eve is a straightforward mention of a well-known tradition, without any apparent irony or exaggeration.
4. there's no obvious contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typically present in sarcastic statements.
5. the tone seems to be matter-of-fact and slightly wistful, rather than mocking or sardonic.

sarcastic

the statement by leonard appears to be a sarcastic comment about scientists' fashion choices. the implication that someone would be interested in seeing ""what all the scientists are wearing this year"" as if it were a fashion show or trend-setting event is likely meant to be humorous. scientists are not typically known for their fashion-forward attire, so suggesting that their clothing choices at an event would be a point of interest is likely a playful, sarcastic remark.",1.0

 PERSON: You're the winner.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of ""winner"" in this context is almost certainly ironic. sheldon is criticizing the person's ability to make cocoa, so calling them a ""winner"" is meant to be contradictory and mocking.

2. the phrase ""you'd think"" often introduces a sarcastic expectation that contrasts with reality.

3. the overall tone is dismissive and critical, which aligns with sarcastic speech.

4. without more context, it's clear that sheldon is expressing disappointment through indirect, biting commentary rather than a straightforward complaint, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that this statement is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic, particularly in sheldon's dismissive attitude towards biology. he's belittling an achievement in biology by characterizing the entire field as being about ""yucky, squishy things."" this is a deliberately reductive and childish description of a complex scientific discipline, which contrasts sharply with the implied importance of the news he's referring to. the sarcasm lies in the juxtaposition of acknowledging that the news ""sounded important"" while simultaneously dismissing its value due to his personal bias against biology. this aligns with the cues about some people valuing certain scientific fields more than others, and the stereotypical view of biological subjects as ""yucky.""",1.0

 PENNY: Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

label: sarcastic

the line ""no, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch"" appears to be a sarcastic comment. the suggestion that a woman would specifically want a man with a pocket watch is likely meant to be humorous and not taken literally. pocket watches are generally considered old-fashioned and not a common accessory for modern men, so proposing this as a desirable trait is likely sheldon's way of making a witty or sarcastic remark about what women might find attractive in a man.",1.0

 PENNY: You sure you just don't miss the sex?
",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reason for this label is:

1. the compliment ""sex with you is pretty great"" is followed immediately by the question ""have you ever tried it?"", which creates a contradictory and humorous situation.

2. the cues mention a ""hint of humor or sarcasm"" in the question at the end.

3. the context suggests this is likely from a sitcom or comedic setting, where sarcasm and witty remarks are common.

4. the question ""have you ever tried it?"" implies the person hasn't experienced their own prowess, which is logically impossible and therefore sarcastic.

this combination of a sincere-sounding compliment followed by an impossible and contradictory question is a classic structure for sarcastic humor, making the statement clearly sarcastic in nature.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the comment made by leonard is clearly sarcastic. he uses an exaggerated, humorous comparison (likening a neck massage to an eagle trying to carry someone to its nest) to criticize someone's massage technique. this kind of hyperbolic, mocking statement is a classic example of sarcasm, where the speaker says something that is the opposite of what they actually mean or feel, often for comedic effect or to express criticism indirectly.",1.0

Howard ""Crash"" Wolowitz.
",BBT,1,"given the context and the cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the response ""yeah, terrific"" is clearly sarcastic, as howard is not genuinely enthusiastic about the idea. the use of positive words like ""terrific"" and ""love"" is intentionally mismatched with the negative implication of having an astronaut named ""crash."" this juxtaposition of positive language with a clearly undesirable situation (having a potentially accident-prone astronaut on a space mission) is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the name ""crash"" is indeed used sarcastically to emphasize the inappropriateness and potential danger of such a nickname for an astronaut.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

sheldon's statement is a clear example of sarcasm. here's why:

1. false equivalence: sheldon is comparing himself to einstein, which is an exaggerated and unrealistic comparison.

2. misrepresentation of facts: the claim that einstein failed math is a common myth, not a factual statement. using this false information as a justification adds to the sarcastic tone.

3. self-aggrandizement: by implying that his poor performance is due to lack of challenge (like einstein), sheldon is sarcastically elevating his own intellectual status.

4. contextual knowledge: for those familiar with sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" this kind of statement is typical of his arrogant and often sarcastic personality.

5. subtle emotional contrast: as noted in the cues, there's a contrast between implied frustration at not being challenged and confidence in comparing himself to einstein, which contributes to the sarcastic tone.

therefore, the statement is clearly intended to be sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. context: amy is describing a very delicate task (the width of a single hair), implying it's extremely difficult.

2. contrast: she then downplays the difficulty by saying ""but this is just biology,"" creating a stark contrast with the previously stated complexity.

3. exaggerated praise: the use of ""genius"" in this context is likely not sincere, but rather an exaggeration to emphasize the difficulty of the task.

4. tone: the overall tone suggests a challenge wrapped in seemingly encouraging words, which is a common structure for sarcastic comments.

5. cues: the emotional words extracted (hope, steady, genius) support this interpretation, as they're being used in a way that doesn't align with their typically positive connotations.

the statement appears to be subtly mocking or challenging the recipient's ability to perform a very difficult task while pretending to be encouraging, which is a classic sarcastic approach.",1.0

the statement combines a dismissive, hostile tone with a condescending attitude that implies unearned superiority. this mix of seemingly contradictory sentiments - outright hostility alongside a patronizing ""generosity"" - is a hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is likely not genuinely expressing that the person is ""lucky"" to hang out with them, but rather using this phrase sarcastically to emphasize their perceived social superiority and disdain for the person being discussed.",1.0

the statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon's character, known for his formal and often socially awkward demeanor, is unlikely to genuinely attribute a ""bad boy attitude"" to his hairstyle. the juxtaposition of his apology with the claim of having a rebellious attitude due to his hair creates a humorous contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm. this statement is likely meant to be ironic and self-deprecating, poking fun at the idea that sheldon could ever be considered a ""bad boy"" simply because of a haircut.",1.0

the statement by leonard is clearly not meant to be taken literally and contains an absurd, exaggerated suggestion that contrasts living in someone's house with living inside their body. this kind of hyperbolic, nonsensical comparison is a common hallmark of sarcastic humor. the cues also suggest this is likely a humorous or absurdist statement rather than a serious suggestion, which aligns with a sarcastic interpretation.",1.0

the input text appears to be a genuine reminiscence of a past experience, without any clear indicators of sarcasm. raj is recalling a camping trip where he and a friend shared personal secrets. the tone seems nostalgic and somewhat awkward due to the nature of the secrets shared, but there's no evident irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the content, while potentially embarrassing or shocking, is presented in a straightforward manner as part of a recollection of ""good times."" therefore, based on the information provided and the context of the statement, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

label: not sarcastic

the statement by howard appears to be a genuine expression of his current emotional state rather than a sarcastic remark. he's directly communicating his desire to be left alone and his somber mood. the phrases ""not really up for chatting"" and ""sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes"" are indicative of someone who is feeling introspective, possibly overwhelmed, or dealing with serious thoughts. while the idea of one's life flashing before their eyes is often associated with near-death experiences, in this context it seems to be used more figuratively to express a deep, reflective state of mind. the tone is more melancholic than sarcastic, making this statement straightforward and not sarcastic.",0.0

the statement by howard is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. the phrase ""we space cowboys"" is already a humorous and exaggerated way to refer to their profession.

2. the claim that they ""don't do what we do for glory and fame"" is immediately undercut by comparing themselves to celebrities like rock stars and athletes.

3. the inclusion of howie mandel in the list of fame-seeking professions adds an unexpected and comedic element, further emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

4. the use of ""okay"" at the beginning sets up a dismissive tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.

5. the contrast between the seemingly humble statement about not seeking glory and fame and the grandiose comparison to celebrities creates irony, a key component of sarcasm.

the emotional words extracted (okay, glory, fame) support this interpretation, as they are used in a context that subverts their usual positive connotations, which is a common technique in sarcastic statements.",1.0

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

the statement ""that sounds a little funny to an american ear"" appears to be a straightforward observation about how something might sound unusual or strange to someone from the united states. there's no indication of sarcasm or irony in this brief comment. the speaker is simply noting a cultural or linguistic difference in perception, which is a common occurrence when discussing language or expressions across different cultures. the tone seems mild and matter-of-fact, without any apparent intent to mock or be sarcastic. therefore, based on the given information and context cues, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 LEONARD: Yeah, maybe. Open it first.
 HOWARD: It's my official NASA portrait.
",BBT,0,"based on the given cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

the reason for this judgment is that the text appears to use the phrase ""out of this world"" in a double meaning that suggests sarcasm:

1. on the surface, it seems to be praising stuart's comic book store as exceptional.
2. however, the second sentence compares this praise to ""the guy in this picture,"" using past tense (""was""), which implies that the person in the picture is no longer around or has changed significantly.

this juxtaposition of a seemingly positive comment with a more somber reference creates a contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm. the speaker appears to be using the phrase ""out of this world"" ironically, possibly suggesting that stuart's store is as obsolete or ""dead"" as the person in the picture.

without more context, it's difficult to be absolutely certain, but the structure and tone of the statement strongly suggest a sarcastic intent rather than a genuine compliment.",1.0

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward description of howard's experience with someone who was depressed. the mention of being able to cheer her up, along with the reference to ben & jerry's ice cream as a comfort food, is consistent with common ways people try to support those who are feeling down. there's no apparent irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the emotional contrast between sadness and cheering up is presented in a sincere manner, and the use of ice cream as a mood lifter is a well-known trope. therefore, based on the given cues and the content of the statement, i believe this text is not sarcastic.",0.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance. sheldon is directly questioning how long someone will continue to reference or benefit from a past event. the use of the idiom ""milk that cow"" is common in everyday speech to express this sentiment, and there's no apparent irony or hidden meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the tone seems genuinely exasperated rather than sarcastic.",0.0

 AMY: And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this statement appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. unexpected connection: the link between crayons and crossing legs is not a typical association, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

2. exaggeration: the idea that seeing crayons would cause such a strong physical reaction (crossing legs) is likely an exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. implied embarrassing incident: the statement hints at a past incident that's probably being dramatized or exaggerated for humorous effect, which is common in sarcastic anecdotes.

4. tone: the casual ""anyway"" at the beginning suggests a nonchalant delivery of what's actually an unusual statement, which is often used in sarcastic humor.

5. absurdity: the overall absurdity of the statement (a lifelong reaction to crayons) points towards it being a sarcastic joke rather than a genuine confession.

given these factors, the statement is most likely meant to be humorous and sarcastic rather than a literal account of penny's experiences.",1.0
SHELDON: Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.,"SHELDON: (thermometer beeps) 102.2.

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear sarcastic undertones. sheldon's statement ""it's like you're not even trying to get better"" is a sarcastic remark expressing frustration and disappointment. the use of exaggeration (""exactly what it was half an hour ago"") and the implication that no progress has been made in a short time frame are typical characteristics of sarcastic speech. 

the context provided also supports this interpretation, noting that the line has ""the tone of a sitcom or similar comedic dialogue"" and expresses frustration in a way that suggests comedic intent rather than genuine criticism. sheldon's character, often associated with sarcasm and dry humor in popular culture, further reinforces this interpretation.

therefore, based on the text itself and the provided context, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic"".",1.0

Our car got stolen.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and context, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic because:

1. it references the popular ""beam me up, scotty"" phrase from star trek, which is often used humorously.
2. the cues mention that this phrase is ""often used humorously to suggest escaping from an unpleasant situation.""
3. by suggesting to ""ask scotty to beam you up,"" the speaker is implying that the current situation is undesirable and that the other person should escape it, which is a sarcastic way of commenting on the circumstances.
4. the use of this pop culture reference in a presumably non-star trek context adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's an exaggerated and unrealistic suggestion.

therefore, the statement ""why don't you ask scotty to beam you up?"" is most likely meant to be sarcastic rather than a sincere suggestion.",1.0

the text appears to be a straightforward description of a work-related event involving a small group of people, including howard, a woman who received a bonus, and some executives. there's no indication of sarcasm or irony in the statement. howard is simply providing factual information about the gathering and its purpose. the tone is neutral and informative, lacking any contradictory elements or exaggerated language that might suggest sarcasm. therefore, based on the content and context provided, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. raj's question ""what, did he use a forklift?"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's a mocking, exaggerated comment implying that the woman in question is so heavy that it would require heavy machinery to ""dump"" her. this kind of hyperbole and insensitive humor is a classic example of sarcasm, especially when discussing sensitive topics like breakups.",1.0

 RAJ: Oh, Howard, stop.
",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the nature of the statement, i believe the correct label for this input is:

sarcastic

this judgment is based on several factors:

1. the contrast between ""trust me"" and the paranoid-sounding ""that's how they get you"" creates an ironic tone typical of sarcasm.

2. the statement implies an absurd conspiracy about people being tricked into thinking they're jewish, which is likely meant to be humorous rather than serious.

3. the abrupt shift from a straightforward denial of someone's jewish identity to a vague, conspiratorial warning is incongruous in a way that often indicates sarcasm.

4. without fuller context, this statement seems designed to subvert expectations and create humor through its unexpected turn, which is a common sarcastic technique.

5. the name ""howard"" and the topic of jewish identity suggest this could be a line from a comedy show or sitcom where such sarcastic remarks about cultural identity are common.

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, the elements present in this short statement strongly suggest a sarcastic intent rather than a sincere comment.",1.0

the text appears to be a straightforward expression of leonard's preferences and feelings about surprises and public displays of emotion. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony in his statement. leonard is being direct and sincere about his comfort with surprises in general, but his discomfort with the specific scenario of being surprised on a jumbotron where he might cry in public. this aligns with common feelings many people have about privacy and emotional vulnerability in public settings. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this text.",0.0

 HOWARD: Now what?
 LEONARD: I don't know.
",BBT,0,"based on the input text and the cue provided, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement by bernadette is indeed sarcastic. while she uses the word ""decency,"" which typically implies politeness or consideration, she's using it ironically in this context. the sarcasm comes from her suggestion that waiting for someone to leave before discussing them behind their back is a form of decency, which is actually quite the opposite.

the phrase ""we're all thinking it. i just had the decency to wait for him to leave"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. bernadette is mockingly presenting her gossiping behavior as being more considerate or decent than others, when in reality, talking about someone behind their back is generally considered impolite.

the contrast between the polite connotation of ""decency"" and the actual behavior being described creates the sarcastic tone, making this statement clearly fall into the ""sarcastic"" category.",1.0

sarcastic

sheldon's response is clearly sarcastic throughout. the use of ""wonderful idea"" is explicitly noted as sarcastic in the cues. the exaggerated and absurd example about oral hygiene (rubbing pudding on gums instead of flossing) further reinforces the sarcastic tone. the final statement about calling the syfy channel to ""give them what for"" expresses frustration in a sarcastic manner, consistent with the cues provided. the overall context and phrasing of sheldon's speech strongly indicate sarcasm, making this label appropriate.",1.0

the statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to acknowledge that his action of installing a camera (presumably without permission) was already far beyond what would be considered merely ""creepy."" the phrase ""looking at creepy in the rearview mirror"" is a figurative way of saying they've gone well past the point of creepy, implying his actions were even more invasive or inappropriate. this self-aware commentary on his own behavior, delivered in a humorous and exaggerated manner, is a classic example of sarcasm.",1.0

the statement exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

2. the thanks for the food (burrito and pork rinds) is juxtaposed with thanks for a ""20-minute lecture"" on monster trucks, implying that the lecture was unsolicited and tedious.

3. the specific mention of the lecture's duration (20 minutes) emphasizes how long and potentially boring it was.

4. the comparison of monster trucks to regular trucks is presented as if it were a serious topic worthy of a lecture, which is likely meant to be humorous.

the response is sarcastic because amy is playfully pointing out the unexpected use of the phrase ""losing my virginity"" in the context of watching a movie for the first time. she's using verbal irony to highlight the contrast between the typical meaning of the phrase and its application to watching raiders of the lost ark. this clever wordplay and the unexpected twist in meaning are hallmarks of sarcasm.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement uses ellipsis (...) which often indicates a pause or hesitation, suggesting there's more to the sentiment than what's directly stated.
2. there's a contrast between ""very entertaining"" and ""glaring story problem,"" which is a classic structure for sarcasm.
3. the use of ""despite"" emphasizes this contrast, implying that the entertainment value somehow overcame a significant flaw, which is likely an exaggeration.
4. the phrase ""glaring story problem"" is quite strong language, which when paired with the positive opening, suggests irony.

the overall tone suggests that amy is being sarcastic about how entertaining the media was, given that there was a major issue with the story. she's likely implying that it wasn't actually very entertaining at all due to the plot problem.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement from penny exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it uses exaggeration for effect (""tear off his clothes"", ""take him right here on this table"").
2. there's an implied contrast between expected social behavior and an extreme action.
3. the rhetorical question format (""how do you not...?"") is often used in sarcastic statements to emphasize a point.

the sarcasm here likely stems from penny expressing extreme attraction or desire in an over-the-top manner, possibly to tease or make a point about someone's attractiveness or her own feelings. the hyperbole serves to create humor and emphasize her point rather than being a literal question or suggestion.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the analysis of the emotional contrasts and the context provided, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the phrase ""not as relieved as i'm about to be"" implies a contrast between current and future states, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. the use of the phrase ""brave new world"" is likely ironic in this context, as it's typically used to describe significant changes, but here it's paired with a mundane situation (presumably using the bathroom).

3. the term ""little lady"" adds a condescending tone, which often accompanies sarcastic remarks.

4. sheldon's character, known from the context of the show ""the big bang theory,"" is often sarcastic and uses dry humor.

these elements combined strongly suggest that sheldon is using sarcasm in this statement, likely to humorously exaggerate the importance or relief of a routine activity.",1.0

the statement appears to be a straightforward declaration of intent from sheldon. there's no obvious contrast between what is said and what is meant, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm. sheldon is making a distinction between ""bothering"" someone and ""talking"" to them, which seems to be a sincere clarification of his intentions. the tone is assertive and determined, but not sarcastic. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement should be considered as non-sarcastic.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward dialogue line from a character named sheldon.
2. sheldon expresses genuine confidence in his ability (""i'm really good at this"").
3. he sincerely asks for a hint to help him solve a problem or answer a question.
4. the content and tone of the text don't suggest any irony or mocking intent that would indicate sarcasm.
5. the question about ""difficulty initiating a stream"" seems to be a genuine attempt at guessing, likely related to a medical symptom or condition.

while sheldon's confidence could potentially be seen as overconfidence in a broader context, this single line doesn't provide enough evidence to suggest that his statement is sarcastic. the text appears to be a sincere attempt at problem-solving or participating in a game or discussion.",0.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. leonard's claim that he was his mother's ""favorite"" directly contradicts the evidence he provides - getting an ""ugly, itchy sweater"" while his brother received a car. the contrast between the poor gift he received and the expensive gift his brother got, followed by his assertion of being the favorite, creates a clear sarcastic tone. 

the use of negative descriptors like ""ugly"" and ""itchy"" for his own gift, compared to the obviously superior gift of a car for his brother, sets up the irony. his final statement ""no, i was her favorite"" is meant to be understood as the opposite of what he's actually saying, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

this response showcases dissatisfaction with unfair treatment while using irony to highlight the absurdity of claiming to be the favorite in such circumstances.",1.0

given the context provided in the cues and the input text itself, i believe this statement is not sarcastic. here's my reasoning:

1. the statement appears to be a genuine attempt by sheldon to change the subject of conversation, likely due to discomfort with the previous topic.

2. mentioning an unexpected skill like yodeling is consistent with sheldon's character (assuming this is from a show like the big bang theory) to bring up random facts about himself.

3. there's no obvious contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm.

4. the tone, as far as we can infer from text alone, seems straightforward rather than mocking or ironic.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
while this statement expresses disappointment and frustration, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. sheldon is directly stating his feelings about the time spent on hulk costumes, which he now considers wasted. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious irony or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm. the emotional contrast between the implied initial excitement for making the costumes and the current disappointment is a genuine expression of changed feelings rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

sarcastic

the statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. it subverts the common expectation of starting a meeting with a joke by suggesting someone has ended with one instead. the tone is dry and critical, implying that whatever was said at the end of the meeting was so ridiculous or inappropriate that it could be considered a joke. this fits perfectly with the definition of sarcasm, where the literal meaning (suggesting someone tell a joke) is opposite to the intended meaning (criticizing someone's behavior or statement).",1.0

 AMY: Yeah, it's Bloom.
 PENNY: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
",BBT,0,"based on the available information and cues provided, i don't have enough context to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the question ""what do you think i was gonna do at home?"" could be interpreted in various ways depending on the broader conversation and the speaker's tone, which are not apparent from this single line.

without additional context, such as the preceding conversation, the speaker's tone of voice, or any follow-up statements, it's not possible to reliably classify this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. the statement could be a genuine question, or it could potentially be sarcastic depending on the situation.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the absence of sufficient context, i would lean towards labeling this as:

not sarcastic

sarcastic

explanation:
howard's comment is clearly sarcastic. the first part of his statement suggests a normal, thoughtful gesture of bringing a cake or pie to a gathering. however, the second part, ""but an insult to her faith is always thoughtful,"" is an obvious use of sarcasm. the juxtaposition of suggesting that insulting someone's faith is ""thoughtful"" is inherently contradictory and meant to be humorous through its absurdity. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning.",1.0

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""ooh, i'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer"" is clearly sarcastic. while ""ooh"" typically suggests excitement or eagerness, in this context it's being used ironically. the idea of finding clues inside a beer is absurd and not meant to be taken literally. penny is likely making a joke about looking for an excuse to have a beer, rather than actually searching for clues. the contrast between the excited ""ooh"" and the ridiculous suggestion that follows is a common structure in sarcastic statements.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement from penny exhibits clear sarcastic humor. she's making light of aging concerns in a humorous way, using unexpected comparisons (beer flatness and physical appearance) to express contentment with her current state. the confident, upbeat tone combined with the somewhat absurd juxtaposition of ideas strongly indicates sarcasm. the phrase ""so far, the future's great"" further emphasizes the sarcastic undertone, as it humorously reduces complex life satisfaction to these simple metrics.",1.0

this appears to be a sarcastic comment from the character sheldon, likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory."" the exaggerated and insulting nature of the question, particularly the phrase ""demented sex pervert,"" suggests sheldon is not being literal but rather using hyperbole and sarcasm to express disapproval or shock at someone's behavior. this kind of acerbic, socially inappropriate comment is characteristic of sheldon's character and is often delivered with sarcastic intent for comedic effect in the show.",1.0

 SHELDON: It's an outrage.

",BBT,1,"based on the input and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
howard's statement appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of ""exciting opportunities"" in the context of home care for the elderly and overweight individuals is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement. such work is generally not considered particularly exciting.

2. the casual and somewhat dismissive way howard refers to potential clients as ""the old and fat"" is inappropriate and unprofessional, suggesting he's not making a sincere job recommendation.

3. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""you know, if you're really serious about that,"" often prefaces a sarcastic or mocking suggestion in casual conversation.

4. without more context, it seems howard is likely responding to someone's career aspirations or job search with a deliberately underwhelming and potentially offensive suggestion, which is a common form of sarcasm.

these elements combined strongly indicate that howard's statement is meant to be sarcastic rather than a genuine job recommendation.",1.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. amy is using exaggeration and contrast to express her frustration about her own romantic situation compared to someone else's. the hyperbole of ""two minutes"" versus ""three years"" and the crude imagery of ""taking his pants off"" are typical elements of sarcastic speech used to emphasize her point and convey her irritation in a biting, humorous way.",1.0

the statement by raj is indeed sarcastic. he's using a hyperbolic statement to humorously exaggerate the impact of bernadette leaving the field of robotics. the phrase ""really took a hit"" is used figuratively to imply a significant negative impact, but it's clearly an overstatement meant to be humorous rather than a sincere assessment. this kind of exaggeration for comedic effect is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0

the statement by leonard is clearly sarcastic. he's using a roundabout way to describe a situation, likely involving penny (the ""first someone"") being flirty without her engagement ring, which led to someone else misinterpreting her availability. the use of ""apparently"" and the intentionally vague ""someone"" and ""another someone"" adds to the sarcastic tone. leonard is indirectly criticizing or expressing frustration about the situation through this sarcastic description.",1.0

3. the specificity and exaggeration in the imagery of the item being discarded in a barn, which is likely not meant to be taken literally.

SHELDON: I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.,"LEONARD: Okay, why?
",BBT,1,"based on the provided context and emotional contrast, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement exhibits classic elements of sarcasm:

1. it presents a surface-level sentiment (struggling to sleep without the snoring) that contrasts with the expected reaction (being relieved to sleep without snoring).

2. there's an underlying irony in treating an typically annoying sound (snoring) as something desirable or necessary for sleep.

3. the emotional contrast between annoyance and affection supports the sarcastic tone, where sheldon is likely expressing his frustration with the snoring in a humorous, backhanded way.

4. the character sheldon (likely referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his sarcastic and often socially inappropriate comments, which further supports this interpretation.

therefore, the statement is best classified as sarcastic, using irony to comment on the disruptive nature of snoring while possibly also conveying a complex emotional attachment.",1.0

3. the context suggests a normal conversation about breakfast and a messy situation, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.
4. the language used is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious verbal irony or contradictions that would indicate sarcasm.

while amy's comment about the syrup-free section of her dashboard could potentially be interpreted as humorous, it doesn't clearly indicate sarcasm based on the information provided. therefore, the most appropriate label appears to be ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

this dialogue excerpt displays clear sarcasm. howard is using exaggerated, figurative language to express his frustration with someone who won't stop talking. the phrase ""chew my leg off"" is a hyperbolic idiom often used sarcastically to indicate extreme desperation to escape an unpleasant situation. howard is not literally going to chew his leg off, but is using this vivid imagery sarcastically to communicate how trapped and annoyed he feels by the other person's continued talking.",1.0

the use of ""and i love that..."" followed by a description of an unequal and unfair situation is a clear indicator of sarcasm. bernadette is not actually expressing love or approval for the situation, but rather using sarcasm to highlight her dissatisfaction with the imbalance of responsibilities between herself and the person she's addressing.",1.0

the statement from bernadette contains clear sarcasm. while she starts by saying ""i love that you take pride in your looks,"" the second part of the sentence reveals her true feelings of frustration. the phrase ""even when i have to pee in the morning, and you're in there spending an hour on your hair"" indicates that this behavior actually inconveniences her significantly.

",BBT,1,"based on the context provided and the nature of the line itself, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the statement ""i love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink"" is clearly sarcastic. howard is not genuinely expressing love or admiration for someone's refusal to urinate in a kitchen sink. instead, he's using irony to mock or criticize what he perceives as overly fastidious behavior. the use of ""love"" in this context is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it's being used to express the opposite of its literal meaning.",1.0

this statement appears to be a straightforward use of a common saying, without any clear indicators of sarcasm. sheldon is likely using this phrase sincerely to acknowledge the end of something positive or enjoyable. the tone seems resigned or accepting rather than sarcastic or mocking. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a non-sarcastic statement.",0.0

the input text appears to be a straightforward question asked by howard about professor abbott's family and their potential interest in some unspecified items. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or any hidden meaning in this brief dialogue. the question seems to be a genuine inquiry about the disposition of professor abbott's belongings, likely in a context where these items are being dealt with, possibly after the professor's retirement or passing. the tone of the question is neutral and inquisitive, without any sarcastic undertones.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the given cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits subtle sarcasm through its juxtaposition of grand expectations (""accomplish something great"") with a more mundane reality (""find meaning in the little moments""). the character howard is expressing a bittersweet realization, using irony to highlight the contrast between societal expectations of greatness and the often overlooked value of everyday experiences. this aligns perfectly with the emotional contrasts mentioned in the cues, particularly the tension between ""great accomplishments"" and ""little moments,"" as well as the overall tone of finding meaning in a potentially disappointing reality.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the reason for this label is that penny's statement, while appearing to be praise on the surface, carries a sarcastic tone. she's pointing out that sheldon was only ""almost"" on topic, which implies he still failed to fully stay on point. her decision to say ""good job, sheldon"" despite this near-miss is likely meant as a backhanded compliment or gentle mockery, especially given the context of sheldon's character typically having difficulty with social cues and conversation norms. the exaggerated nature of praising someone for barely meeting a basic conversational expectation further reinforces the sarcastic intent behind penny's words.",1.0

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the statement from howard is clearly using sarcasm to make a point. the exaggerated self-deprecation in referring to himself as a ""dummy"" and suggesting that a blanket is ""complicated"" are strong indicators of sarcastic intent. this kind of overstatement is a common technique in sarcastic speech, especially when someone is trying to highlight the absurdity of a situation or another person's perception of them.",1.0

the statement from penny has a clear sarcastic tone. she's not genuinely suggesting that they should have their mom send pants from walmart in houston. instead, she's using this exaggerated and mock-agreeing statement to ridicule or criticize the other person's suggestion or behavior. the specificity of mentioning walmart in houston adds to the sarcastic effect, implying that the other person's choices or suggestions are outdated, unsophisticated, or dependent on parental help.",1.0

the statement is indeed sarcastic. sheldon's words create a humorous contrast between his typically formal, scientific approach and the crude subject matter he's discussing. the sarcasm lies in his apparent enthusiasm for subjecting himself to something that would normally make him uncomfortable, framing it as a scientific experiment. this juxtaposition of his serious tone with the absurdity of the situation is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1.0

the context suggests this is likely a line from a sitcom or comedy script, where the character sheldon is making a blunt and potentially insensitive comment about a woman's menstrual symptoms. the way he phrases it, listing out the symptoms in a matter-of-fact manner, implies a lack of empathy and social awareness that is often associated with sarcastic or comedic dialogue, especially in the context of a character like sheldon (possibly from ""the big bang theory""). the sarcasm lies in the inappropriate bluntness and timing of such a statement, which is likely meant to be humorous in its lack of tact.",1.0

while raj's statement describes an unethical practice, there's no indication of sarcasm in his words. he appears to be straightforwardly admitting to creating fake accounts to artificially boost the paper's reception. the hesitation (""uh"") suggests he might be uncomfortable or embarrassed about this admission, but not that he's being sarcastic. the statement is a direct description of his actions without any apparent irony or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious irony or contradiction.
2. puzzle boxes are commonly used to present information in an engaging way, which aligns with penny's actions.
3. the challenge ""let's see if you can open it"" is a typical way to present a puzzle box, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.
4. there are no clear emotional contrasts or exaggerations that might suggest sarcasm.

the statement appears to be a straightforward, factual response about stuart's independent selection of throw pillows. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the context suggests this is part of a normal conversation about home decor choices, and raj is simply providing information about who made the decision regarding the throw pillows.",0.0

the statement ""yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood"" appears to be a genuine, light-hearted observation rather than a sarcastic comment. the speaker is noting that having multiple menorahs creates a particular atmosphere, likely referring to the festive and warm ambiance associated with hanukkah celebrations.

there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this statement:

1. the tone seems sincere and matter-of-fact.
2. there's no obvious exaggeration or irony.
3. the observation aligns with the common understanding that holiday decorations can influence the mood of a space.
4. the use of ""yeah"" at the beginning suggests agreement or confirmation, rather than contradiction or mockery.

explanation:
the statement by bernadette is straightforward and sincere. she's expressing a genuine desire for a familiar, comfortable dining experience with friends. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the tone is neutral and the sentiment aligns with common social behavior of wanting to recreate enjoyable past experiences. therefore, this statement can be classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

sarcastic

howard's statement is clearly a joke that playfully reinterprets a serious religious historical event (the israelites wandering in the desert) through a modern, trivial lens (walking off a big meal). this unexpected juxtaposition of the sacred and the mundane, along with the absurd implication that a 40-year journey was for dietary reasons, is a classic example of sarcastic humor.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward assignment of responsibilities.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the cues mention that there are no obvious emotional contrasts or emotional words in the text.
4. while the mention of ""being 75"" might seem odd without context, it doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm. it could be part of a role-playing scenario or have some other literal meaning in the broader context.

given the limited information and lack of contradictory cues, it's most likely that this statement is meant to be taken at face value, hence the ""not sarcastic"" label.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""and if i had a friend, they might have told me that"" is likely sarcastic because:

1. it implies amy doesn't have friends, which is probably not literally true.
2. the hypothetical nature of the statement (""if i had a friend"") contrasts with the typical expectation that most people have friends.
3. the tone suggests a self-deprecating humor or irony about amy's social situation.
4. the statement indirectly criticizes the lack of information or support amy feels she's receiving, using the absence of a hypothetical friend as a vehicle for this criticism.

this kind of self-referential humor about one's own social status or lack of information is a common form of sarcasm, making this statement likely to be sarcastic rather than a literal observation.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement ""oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit"" uses a crude and exaggerated comparison that is likely meant to be humorous or shocking rather than genuine advice. the casual tone (""oh, just..."") combined with the bizarre and somewhat gross analogy to popping a zit suggests this is not meant to be taken literally. instead, it appears to be a sarcastic or facetious response, possibly to mock or humorously dismiss someone's difficulty with consuming something.",1.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this line is clearly sarcastic. leonard is making a joke by referencing star wars' concept of ""the force"" and applying it to his ability to sense when someone arrives in california. the humor comes from the exaggeration and absurdity of claiming he has jedi-like powers to detect someone's arrival. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the speaker says something they don't literally mean for humorous effect.",1.0

the speaker's response appears to be genuinely enthusiastic about joining in for the meatloaf meal. the phrase ""you don't have to not ask me twice"" is an idiomatic expression indicating eagerness, rather than sarcasm. the context and emotional cues suggest sincere interest in the meal, without any indicators of irony or sarcasm.",0.0

 PENNY: Stay out of it! Shut up!
",BBT,0,"based on the given cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere observation by raj about their surroundings and a personal connection they've made to a memorial they've encountered. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the statement. the tone shifts from casual observation to a more somber realization, but this shift seems genuine rather than sarcastic. the use of ""oh, yes"" at the beginning and the thoughtful pause indicated by the ellipsis (...) further suggest a natural, non-sarcastic flow of thoughts.",0.0

 PERSON1: Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas you can actually get married in.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided information and the context of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
the statement ""wow, there's a denny's in vegas you can actually get married in"" is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of ""wow"" at the beginning suggests surprise or disbelief, which in this context is probably exaggerated for effect.

2. denny's is typically known as a casual, inexpensive restaurant chain, not a wedding venue. the juxtaposition of getting married in a denny's is unexpected and humorous.

3. las vegas is famous for its elaborate and sometimes unconventional wedding venues. the idea of choosing denny's for a wedding in a city known for extravagant options adds to the sarcastic tone.

4. the phrase ""you can actually get married in"" emphasizes the absurdity of the situation, implying that it's not a typical or desirable place for a wedding.

the character penny is likely making a sarcastic comment about the unusual nature of this wedding venue option, expressing amusement or mockery at the idea of getting married in a denny's restaurant.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the quote ""you have to stop the q-tip when there is resistance"" is likely a sarcastic statement from the character chandler in the tv show ""friends."" while it appears to be giving sincere advice about ear cleaning, it's important to consider chandler's character and the context of the show:

1. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor and witty remarks.
2. the statement is framed as obvious advice, which is often a setup for sarcasm.
3. the phrasing ""you have to stop..."" implies that someone has been doing this incorrectly, which adds to the humorous and sarcastic tone.
4. in the context of a sitcom like ""friends,"" this kind of statement is typically delivered for comedic effect rather than as genuine advice.

while the statement does contain factual information about ear cleaning, the way it's presented and the character delivering it strongly suggest it's meant to be taken as a sarcastic quip rather than straightforward advice. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this quote.",1.0

label: sarcastic

the repetition of ""yes"" combined with the exclamation marks and the unexpected mention of ""in prison!!"" strongly suggest this is a sarcastic statement. the initial enthusiasm implied by ""yes yes"" is abruptly contrasted with the negative connotation of being in prison, creating a classic sarcastic structure where the speaker appears to affirm something positive but then subverts it with a negative or unexpected twist. this juxtaposition is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the statement exhibits a clear emotional contrast between desperation and self-awareness, which is a common element in sarcasm.

2. chandler's character in the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic humor, often using self-deprecating jokes.

3. the exaggerated and dramatized nature of the statement (""oh no don't go. i have scared you."") followed by an overtly self-critical description (""i am hopeless and awkward and desperate for love"") is typical of chandler's sarcastic style.

4. the sudden shift from trying to prevent someone from leaving to an extreme self-assessment creates a humorous effect characteristic of sarcasm.

5. while the statement expresses vulnerability, it does so in such an over-the-top manner that it becomes comedic rather than genuinely desperate, which is a hallmark of sarcastic delivery.

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given cues and the input text, i believe i can provide a reliable judgment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""sounds like she has got the whole package!"" is typically used to express genuine admiration or approval. the phrase ""whole package"" is commonly used to describe someone who possesses multiple desirable qualities or attributes. in this context, without any contradictory information or hints of irony, it appears that monica is sincerely praising someone's positive qualities. the cues provided also support this interpretation, mentioning that the statement conveys a positive sentiment and doesn't contain any clear emotional contrasts or indicators of sarcasm. therefore, it's most likely that this statement is meant to be taken at face value and is not sarcastic.",0.0

 CHANDLER: Its possible, you are very lovable.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the information provided and the context cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

this line appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the statement is somewhat absurd - saying you'd miss someone if you broke up with them is an unusual way to be supportive.

2. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, especially in the context of relationships (assuming this is from the tv show ""friends"").

3. the follow-up comment ""just trying to be supportive"" seems to acknowledge the awkwardness of the previous statement, suggesting it wasn't meant to be taken at face value.

4. there's a subtle contradiction between the idea of breaking up (which chandler frames as his own action) and then trying to be supportive about it, which creates an ironic tension typical of sarcasm.

the sarcasm here seems to stem from chandler's attempt to be reassuring backfiring due to his awkward phrasing, which he then tries to explain away, likely in a self-deprecating manner consistent with his character.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Oh, uh, no thanks. I just had an M&M.","PERSON: Hey, you guys the water is great. You should really go in!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and my analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this line is likely sarcastic because:

1. the response is disproportionate: declining a (presumably more substantial) food offer because of having eaten a single m&m is an exaggeration.

2. it's characteristic of sitcom humor: this type of witty, exaggerated response is common in comedic dialogue, especially for a character like chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic quips.

3. the setup implies humor: the hesitation (""oh, uh"") followed by the unexpected reason creates a comedic timing typical of sarcastic remarks.

4. implausibility: it's unlikely that eating one m&m would actually satisfy someone's hunger or be a reason to decline food, which points to the statement being intentionally humorous and not meant to be taken literally.

the combination of these factors strongly suggests that this line is meant to be interpreted as sarcastic rather than a genuine, literal statement.",1.0

the statement by chandler appears to be a straightforward expression of resignation and helplessness in response to someone's absence or delayed return. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory tones. the language used is direct and seems to genuinely convey an inability to influence the situation, which aligns with a non-sarcastic interpretation.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

based on the provided cues and the input text, i would categorize this statement as ""not sarcastic."" the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the statement is brief and direct, without any obvious indicators of irony or exaggeration that are often present in sarcastic remarks.

2. the cues suggest a theme of helplessness or inability, which aligns with the literal meaning of the statement.

3. there's no apparent contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

4. the emotional tone suggested by the cues (limitation, helplessness) is consistent with a straightforward, non-sarcastic expression of perceived inability.

5. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this is a sincere expression of joey's belief about someone's capabilities (or lack thereof).

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, in this case, the simplicity and directness of the statement, combined with the analyzed cues, point more strongly towards a literal, non-sarcastic interpretation.",0.0

3. the contrast in opinions (chandler's enthusiasm vs. monica's skepticism) is presented in a matter-of-fact way, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.
4. the use of ""funny"" in this context seems to mean ""coincidental"" or ""interesting"" rather than indicating sarcasm.
5. chandler's suggestion about the lights encouraging people to use the balcony appears to be a genuine idea, not a sarcastic comment.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the exclamation ""oh my god, you almost gave me a heart attack!"" is a common hyperbolic expression used to convey genuine surprise or shock. in this context, chandler is likely reacting to something unexpected or startling that happened, rather than using sarcasm. the phrase is typically used literally to express a strong emotional reaction, even though it's not meant to be taken literally in terms of actually causing a heart attack. this kind of exaggerated language is often used for emphasis in sincere, non-sarcastic communication.",0.0

### explanation:
based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, this statement appears to be genuinely serious and not sarcastic. the context suggests a grave medical situation where doctors have determined that a certain medical procedure would result in death. the use of the word ""die"" and the overall tone of urgency and concern in chandler's statement align with a serious, non-sarcastic delivery of critical medical information. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrasting emotions that would typically be present in sarcastic statements. therefore, the most appropriate label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement comes from a character named chandler, likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends."" chandler is known for his sarcastic humor.
2. winning a million dollars is an extremely unlikely event, making it a common subject for sarcastic or exaggerated statements.
3. without additional context, this sudden announcement of winning a large sum of money seems more likely to be a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine statement.
4. in sitcoms like ""friends,"" characters often use sarcasm or exaggeration for comedic effect, especially when dealing with unlikely or desired scenarios.

while there's no explicit contrast or contextual information provided, the nature of the statement and the character's typical behavior strongly suggest this is meant to be interpreted sarcastically rather than literally.",1.0

the statement appears to be a genuine realization by chandler that he no longer has something he thought he did. there's no evident irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a straightforward, albeit somewhat confused, response to a previous question or statement. the character is simply recalling what he did with an item earlier in the day, which is a common, non-sarcastic type of dialogue.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this response is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. it references the famous 1971 anti-littering psa featuring a native american actor (often referred to as ""the crying indian"").

2. chandler's statement humorously and ironically suggests that littering would summon this figure to ""save"" them, which is the opposite of the psa's intended message.

3. the idea of intentionally littering to attract help is absurd and contrary to the psa's goal of reducing littering.

4. this type of witty, ironic comment is very characteristic of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor.

the sarcasm here relies on the viewer's familiarity with the referenced psa and subverts its message for comedic effect, making it a clear example of sarcastic dialogue.",1.0

2. the t-shirt slogan ""i don't belong here"" is self-deprecating and ironic, which is a common form of sarcastic humor.
3. wearing a shirt that explicitly states not belonging is likely meant to be humorous and contradictory, as the act of wearing it draws attention to oneself.
4. the brevity and deadpan delivery of the line (typical of chandler's character) suggests it's meant to be taken as a dry, sarcastic comment rather than a literal description.

reasoning:
1. the statement contrasts two scenarios: something unspecified that chandler sees as worthy of crying over, versus the cartoon bambi.

3. however, he then dismisses bambi as ""just a cartoon,"" implying it shouldn't elicit such an emotional response.
4. this creates a contradiction between acknowledging emotional responses to some media while dismissing others based on their format (cartoon), which is a common structure in sarcastic statements.
5. the tone suggests chandler is making a point about the absurdity of crying over a cartoon, using sarcasm to emphasize his opinion.

the statement uses contrast and implied judgment to create a sarcastic commentary on emotional responses to different types of media, making ""sarcastic"" the most appropriate label for this text.",1.0

this response from chandler is clearly sarcastic. the humor comes from the absurd contrast between mentioning a bulldozer (which he obviously doesn't have) and then immediately stating he doesn't have tools. the exaggerated first part of the statement is set up specifically to contradict the second part, which is a common structure in sarcastic remarks. chandler's character in the show ""friends"" is also well-known for his frequent use of sarcasm, adding to the likelihood that this line is meant to be taken sarcastically.",1.0
"CHANDLER: We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.","JOEY: Quack quack, quack quack, quack quack.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement by chandler appears to be a genuine expression of understanding. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the text. the tone seems sincere, as chandler is acknowledging that their previous confusion about the delay in receiving a gift is now resolved. the phrase ""now we understand"" suggests a sincere realization rather than a sarcastic remark. without any contradictory context or obvious irony, this statement comes across as straightforward and not sarcastic.",0.0
CHANDLER: Oh tons. I am quite the woodsman.,"CHANDLER: Okay, lets find these birds.
 JOEY: Wait wait, you hear that? There are in the table?
 CHANDLER: That can't be good
 JOEY: We have to get them out of there
 CHANDLER: how?
 JOEY: Maybe we can lure them out, you know of any bird calls?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the character chandler is likely exaggerating his woodsmanship skills, which is a common form of sarcasm.

2. the phrase ""oh tons"" followed by ""i am quite the woodsman"" suggests an overstatement that's typical of sarcastic remarks.

3. without additional context, chandler's claim to be ""quite the woodsman"" seems incongruous with what we might expect from his character (assuming this is chandler from the tv show ""friends""), which often adds to the sarcastic tone.

4. the cues mention that the tone suggests he may be boasting or exaggerating his abilities, which aligns with a sarcastic interpretation.

while it's possible this could be a genuine statement, the combination of the exaggerated language and the likely mismatch between chandler's typical character and woodsmanship skills strongly suggests this is meant to be taken sarcastically.",1.0

"CHANDLER: I am sorry, we donÕt have your sheep.","RACHEL: Hey
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

the given text appears to be a straightforward apology and statement from a character named chandler. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief line. the use of ""sorry"" seems genuine in this context, and the statement about not having someone's sheep, while unusual, doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. without additional context or cues that might indicate a sarcastic tone or intent, it's most appropriate to label this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
"CHANDLER: No, rabies.","CHANDLER: What what?
 JOEY: Hey, shaving?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the information provided and the brief nature of the input text, i don't have enough context to confidently determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the line ""chandler: no, rabies."" could be either a straightforward response in a serious conversation about diseases, or it could be a sarcastic remark depending on the broader context of the dialogue.

without more information about the tone, situation, or preceding conversation, it's not possible to accurately label this as either ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"". the character chandler is often associated with sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"", but this single line alone doesn't provide enough evidence to make that determination.

therefore, i cannot assign a definitive label to this input based solely on the information provided.",0.0
CHANDLER: Was that place the sun?,"CHANDLER: Hold on, there is something different.
 ROSS: I went to their tanning place your wife suggested.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the available cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this dialogue is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. while the text itself doesn't contain obvious emotional content, the question ""was that place the sun?"" seems illogical or exaggerated when taken literally.
2. the character chandler, often associated with the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor.
3. asking if a place was ""the sun"" is likely a hyperbolic way of saying the place was extremely hot or bright, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. without more context, the question appears to be using absurdity for comedic effect, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

while there's always a possibility of misinterpretation without fuller context, the combination of the unusual question and chandler's character reputation strongly suggests this is a sarcastic remark.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this line appears to be sarcastic for a few reasons:

1. self-referential contradiction: chandler is speaking about himself in the third person, which is unusual and likely for comedic effect.

2. logical inconsistency: the statement ""no you are not chandler"" followed immediately by ""we still love you chandler"" is contradictory and absurd, suggesting it's not meant to be taken literally.

3. context clues: while we don't have full context, this sounds like dialogue from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic humor.

4. tone: the statement has an exaggerated, dramatic quality that's often associated with sarcasm.

the line appears to be chandler mockingly reassuring himself, possibly in response to something that has happened or been said. the sarcasm likely stems from self-deprecation or a humorous situation where chandler's identity or typical behavior has been questioned.",1.0

 ROSS: And you're afraid you wont be able to fill his shoes
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""i was saying the actual words"" appears to be a straightforward clarification by chandler.
2. there's no apparent irony or contradiction in the statement that would indicate sarcasm.
3. the cues suggest that chandler is emphasizing he was speaking literally, which aligns with a non-sarcastic interpretation.
4. without additional context indicating a sarcastic tone or contradictory situation, it's most likely that chandler is simply explaining himself in a literal manner.

therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" seems most appropriate for this input.",0.0

while the statement is humorous and exaggerated, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. chandler is providing a vivid, comedic description of someone's uncoordinated movement, but he's not saying the opposite of what he means (which would be characteristic of sarcasm). the description is meant to be funny and over-the-top, but it's a straightforward attempt at humor rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward, matter-of-fact response from chandler. he's clarifying a point about the impossibility of time travel, which aligns with common knowledge and scientific understanding. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically signal sarcasm. the tone seems informative and literal rather than mocking or satirical, which are common elements of sarcastic statements.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

the input text ""chandler: did i wake you?"" is a straightforward question without any apparent sarcastic tone or context. the cues provided don't indicate any contrasting emotions, hidden meanings, or contextual clues that would suggest sarcasm. it appears to be a genuine inquiry, likely in a situation where chandler is concerned about potentially disturbing someone's sleep.",0.0

 RACHEL: You don't mind do you, that would really help me a lot Thanks.
 MONICA: I don't think I have enough quarters
 PHOEBE: I have quarters!
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i believe this label is correct based on the following reasoning:

1. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, especially in the tv show ""friends"" where this quote likely originates.

2. doing laundry is generally not considered an exciting activity, especially not something people would typically be enthusiastic about doing ""all night.""

3. the exaggerated excitement in the phrase ""all night laundry!"" seems deliberately over-the-top, which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. the context of being able to do laundry late into the night is not typically something that would elicit genuine excitement, further suggesting a sarcastic tone.

5. chandler's character often uses sarcasm to cope with or comment on mundane or slightly inconvenient situations, which fits this scenario of having to do laundry late at night.

given these points, it's highly likely that chandler is being sarcastic about the prospect of doing laundry all night, rather than genuinely excited about it.",1.0

the input text is clearly sarcastic. this is typical of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic and often dark humor. he's making a morbid joke about new year's resolutions and plane crashes, which is not meant to be taken literally. the contrast between the casual tone and the dark subject matter is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially in chandler's case. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic"".",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input and the current cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this quote is a clear example of chandler's characteristic sarcasm from the tv show ""friends"". he's making a mocking comment about an unusual name by comparing it to characters from a children's show, which is a typical sarcastic technique of exaggeration for humorous effect. the ""ahh"" at the end further emphasizes his sarcastic tone.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this statement is clearly meant to be a humorous, exaggerated response to a minor annoyance. the extreme overreaction of killing someone for eating gum is absurd and not meant to be taken literally, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic wit in the show ""friends,"" further supporting this interpretation.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using an exaggerated and absurd scenario (being across the street with a telescope and donuts) to contrast with whatever actually happened, emphasizing that his actions were accidental and not premeditated. the specific mention of a telescope and donuts creates a comical image of deliberate spying or stakeout, which is intentionally over-the-top to highlight the ridiculousness of assuming his actions were intentional. this kind of hyperbolic comparison is a classic form of sarcasm, especially in sitcom dialogue.",1.0

sarcastic

this line is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic humor from the tv show ""friends"". the wordplay and intentional mispronunciation of ""coincidence"" as ""joincidence"" is typical of chandler's character, who often uses sarcasm and witty remarks. the emphasis on ""with a c"" further underscores the sarcastic tone, as he's pointing out the obvious in a playful, mocking manner. this kind of humor is quintessential chandler and is clearly meant to be taken as sarcasm rather than a literal statement.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward, factual comment about the jamestown colony and land grants from king george. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory tones. the context suggests this is likely part of a conversation or explanation about early american colonial history. without any apparent contrast between the literal meaning and intended meaning, or any other hallmarks of sarcastic speech, it's reasonable to conclude that this statement is not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this line is almost certainly intended to be sarcastic and humorous. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic wit, especially in the tv show ""friends."" the absurdity of mistaking a knapsack for a parachute in a potentially dangerous situation is clearly meant to be a comedic, sarcastic observation rather than a genuine mistake. the ""dear god"" opening further emphasizes the dramatic, exaggerated nature of the statement, which is characteristic of sarcastic humor.",1.0

this statement is clearly an exaggeration for comedic effect, which is a common form of sarcasm. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, especially in the tv show ""friends,"" and this line fits that pattern perfectly. the hyperbole of claiming to see someone's brain when they lean back is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to humorously emphasize how far back the person tilted their head.",1.0

the line ""me? i am gonna die alone!"" spoken by chandler appears to be an exaggerated, dramatic statement that is likely meant to be humorous rather than entirely sincere. this type of hyperbolic self-deprecating humor about relationships is a common comedic device, especially for chandler's character if this is from the tv show friends. the over-the-top nature of declaring he will ""die alone"" in response to an implied question or situation suggests sarcasm or irony rather than a genuine belief.",1.0

1. the absurdity of the situation described (spanish midgets wrestling julie).
2. chandler's deadpan delivery, particularly the sudden shift to ""okay yes i see how they got there.""
3. the context suggests this is likely from a sitcom (possibly ""friends""), where chandler is known for his sarcastic humor.
4. the statement implies a ridiculous logical leap that chandler is pretending to understand, which is a common form of sarcasm.

the sarcasm here lies in chandler's feigned understanding of an obviously absurd situation, delivered in a way that highlights the ridiculousness of it.",1.0

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward declaration by chandler about needing to do something quickly. there's no apparent irony or contradiction in his words that would suggest sarcasm. the emphasis on the task being small and quick, followed by the abrupt ""get up"" command, seems more indicative of urgency or mild anxiety rather than sarcasm. the context provided in the cues also supports this interpretation, describing it as a simple statement about needing to complete a small task quickly.",0.0

sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using exaggeration and dark humor to make light of waiting until the last minute, likely referring to using the bathroom. the use of dramatic words like ""daredevil,"" ""burst,"" and ""die"" in relation to such a mundane activity is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic wit in the show friends. the hyperbole creates a humorous contrast between the trivial nature of the situation and the life-or-death terms he's using to describe it.",1.0

sarcastic

the quote from chandler is clearly using sarcasm to mock overly critical parenting. the exaggeration of criticizing something as trivial as ""the flatness of a child's pillow"" is a classic example of sarcastic humor, emphasizing the absurdity of such nitpicky parental behavior. this aligns perfectly with the cues mentioning humorous reference to parental criticism and fits the typical sarcastic tone often used in sitcom dialogue.",1.0

reasoning:
the statement appears to be a straightforward observation or speculation by a character named chandler about why another character, damone, smokes alone in his cell. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the sentence seems to be a genuine attempt to explain or understand damone's behavior. without additional context or cues suggesting a sarcastic intent, it's most appropriate to interpret this statement as non-sarcastic.",0.0

chandler's comment is clearly sarcastic in nature. he's making a humorous and absurd comparison between whatever situation they're discussing and promotional contests where people are encouraged to collect multiple items. the phrase ""collect all five"" is typically associated with marketing gimmicks or collectible promotions, and chandler is applying it ironically to a context where it likely doesn't fit. this mismatch between the serious situation and the frivolous comparison is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially given chandler's character tendency towards sarcastic humor in the show friends.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
while the statement ""oh, um, i don't care!"" could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic in certain contexts, the available information doesn't provide strong evidence for sarcasm. the hesitation indicated by ""oh, um"" followed by the exclamation suggests a more straightforward expression of indifference or sudden disinterest, rather than a sarcastic remark. without additional context about the tone, situation, or chandler's typical speaking patterns, it's safer to interpret this as a non-sarcastic statement of genuine (if perhaps exaggerated) lack of concern.",0.0

1. the phrase ""ah your own brand of vigilante justice"" carries a tone of wry amusement or sarcasm, which is typical of sarcastic statements.

2. multiple cues mention that this line appears to be sarcastic or delivered with a hint of sarcasm.

3. the character chandler, who is speaking this line, is often associated with sarcastic humor (assuming this is from the tv show ""friends"").

4. the use of ""ah"" at the beginning of the sentence often indicates a sarcastic or exaggerated realization, which fits with the overall sarcastic tone.

5. the phrase ""your own brand"" implies a personal, potentially misguided approach to justice, which chandler seems to be commenting on with subtle mockery.

given these factors, the statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward observation.",1.0
CHANDLER: Did you tell her about the magical night that starts with the flush of every toilet?,"CHANDLER: So Ross, how was the date the other night?
",FRIENDS,1,"label: sarcastic

this line from chandler is clearly sarcastic. he's referring to a ""magical night"" in an ironic way, especially when connecting it to toilets flushing. this kind of dry, sarcastic humor is very characteristic of chandler's character in the show friends. the juxtaposition of ""magical"" with the mundane and somewhat unpleasant image of flushing toilets creates a sarcastic tone, mocking the idea of a romantic or special evening.",1.0

 CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the response clearly exhibits sarcastic elements. monica is using exaggeration and an absurd comparison (equating something to ""having a third nipple"") to downplay the significance of an issue. this hyperbolic comparison is a classic sarcastic technique used to make light of a situation or to express irony. the contrast between claiming something is ""not big"" and then comparing it to an unusual physical trait creates a humorous effect that is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input and the provided cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

this line appears to be a sarcastic joke from the character chandler, likely from the tv show ""friends"". the content and delivery are consistent with chandler's typical sarcastic humor, especially the self-aware comment about being ""allowed one joke in the monkey is penis genre."" the sarcasm is evident in both the initial rhetorical question and the exaggerated follow-up statement.",1.0
CHANDLER: And I think my testicles may be in here too,"RACHEL: Do you guys have any exta ribbon?
 CHANDLER: Oh yeah sure, what do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, rafia, gingam , felt.
",FRIENDS,1,"label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using hyperbole (extreme exaggeration) for comedic effect. the cues provided support this interpretation:

1. humor: the statement is intended to be funny through exaggeration.
2. embarrassment: there's an implication of embarrassment around discussing a sensitive body part.
3. discomfort/unease: the speaker is expressing physical discomfort in a humorous way.

chandler's comment is not meant to be taken literally. he's using sarcasm to humorously emphasize how uncomfortable or tight something is (likely clothing or a situation). this type of exaggerated, self-deprecating humor is characteristic of chandler's character in the show ""friends,"" and is a clear example of sarcasm.",1.0

 RACHEL: No, no, no, the love part? Oh my god!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by joey is clearly sarcastic. he's sarcastically suggesting that rubbing one's head will ""turn back time,"" which is obviously not possible. this kind of exaggerated, impossible suggestion is a classic form of sarcasm, often used for humorous effect or to tease someone. the cues also support this interpretation, noting that the statement appears to be sarcastic or joking rather than conveying a specific emotion.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided input and cues, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

rationale:
the exclamation ""no way!"" is typically used to express genuine surprise, disbelief, or strong disagreement. without additional context, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the cues suggest this is likely a straightforward expression of shock or disbelief from the character chandler, possibly from a script or dialogue. while chandler (if referring to the character from ""friends"") is known for sarcastic comments, this particular exclamation on its own does not provide enough context to infer sarcasm. therefore, it's more appropriate to classify this as not sarcastic in the absence of clear contradictory evidence or additional context that would suggest otherwise.",0.0
RACHEL: Oh.,"RACHEL: Hi! What are you doing here?
 ROSS: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input ""rachel: oh."" and the current cues, it's not possible to definitively determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the word ""oh"" can be used in various contexts and tones, including both sincere and sarcastic ones.

without additional context, such as the tone of voice, the surrounding conversation, or rachel's facial expression, we cannot accurately label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic.

therefore, i cannot assign a reliable label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input. more context would be needed to make an informed judgment.",0.0
CHANDLER: The whole thing! Can we go?,"JOEY: You liked it? You really liked it?
 CHANDLER: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the limited context provided and the cues available, i don't have enough information to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the line ""chandler: the whole thing! can we go?"" on its own doesn't contain clear indicators of sarcasm. without more context about the situation, the tone of the conversation, or chandler's typical speaking style, it's not possible to reliably assign a sarcasm label. the statement could be sincere impatience or it could potentially be sarcastic, depending on the broader context. therefore, i cannot provide a definitive label of 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic' for this input.",0.0
"CHANDLER: Great! Okay, here.","PHOEBE: See, if I am not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity
 CHANDLER: Okay, that's enough honey!
 PERSON: I don't know. Let me see the ring.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited context provided and the cues available, i don't have enough information to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the exclamation ""great!"" could be genuine enthusiasm or it could be sarcastic, depending on the broader context and tone of delivery, which are not clear from this brief snippet.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the apparently straightforward nature of the statement, i would lean towards labeling it as:

not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this judgment is made with low confidence due to the very limited context available. in a tv show context, especially if this is from the character chandler in ""friends"" (who is known for his sarcastic humor), there's always a possibility that the line could be delivered sarcastically. without more context or information about the tone and situation, it's difficult to make a definitive determination.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
the given line appears to be a straightforward question from phoebe about the appearance of an object. there's no clear indication of sarcasm or irony in this isolated statement. without additional context that might suggest a contradictory or exaggerated tone, it's safer to interpret this as a genuine inquiry rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

this dialogue line from ross appears to be a genuine expression of shock, surprise, and concern. the exclamation ""oh my god"" and the stuttered ""wh-what"" indicate real distress or alarm about something unexpected that has occurred. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in this brief statement. ross seems to be sincerely asking for information about a situation that has caught him off guard. therefore, the appropriate label for this input is ""not sarcastic"".",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as ""not sarcastic."" the statement from rachel appears to be a genuine expression of fear or anxiety about something she finds scary, likely a movie or tv show. the exclamation ""oh boy"" followed by her inability to watch due to fear is a common, sincere reaction to frightening content. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the emotional contrast between initial excitement and subsequent fear is typical of authentic responses to suspenseful or horror content. therefore, rachel's statement can be interpreted as a straightforward, non-sarcastic expression of her genuine feelings.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the exclamation ""really!?"" is often used to express genuine surprise, disbelief, or excitement.
2. without additional context, there's no clear indication of sarcasm or irony.
3. the brief nature of the statement doesn't provide enough information to infer a sarcastic tone confidently.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input text ""monica: what? why?"", there is not enough context to reliably determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the words alone do not inherently indicate sarcasm. without additional context about the situation, tone of voice, or surrounding conversation, it's impossible to accurately label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic.

therefore, i cannot confidently assign a label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input. the statement could be a genuine question expressing confusion or surprise, or it could potentially be sarcastic depending on the context in which it was said. more information would be needed to make an accurate determination.",0.0

reasoning:
the brief exclamation ""oh! oop!"" from phoebe appears to be a genuine reaction of surprise followed by a minor mistake or realization. these interjections are typically used to express sudden emotional reactions or small accidents, and there's no clear indication of sarcasm in this short utterance. without additional context that might suggest an ironic or mocking tone, it's most likely a straightforward, non-sarcastic expression of surprise or a minor mishap.",0.0

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""what a baby"" is typically used in a derogatory or dismissive manner, which aligns with sarcastic speech.
2. the cues mention that this line is likely spoken in a dismissive or critical tone.
3. using ""baby"" to refer to an adult or a situation is often done sarcastically to imply immaturity or overreaction.
4. the character chandler, if this is from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor, which further supports this interpretation.

while the statement is brief, the combination of the dismissive tone, the use of ""baby"" as an insult, and the typical speaking style of the character chandler (if it's from ""friends"") strongly suggests that this line is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0

"CHANDLER: Excellent hole, Joe.","MONICA: Enhh
 CHANDLER: I've got canned goods.
 JOEY: Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

rationale:
while the surface-level interpretation of ""excellent hole, joe"" could be a genuine compliment, especially in a context like golf, the cues suggest this line is likely from a sitcom or comedy context (given the names chandler and joe, which are associated with the tv show ""friends""). in such contexts, seemingly positive statements are often delivered sarcastically for comedic effect.

the lack of additional context and the brevity of the statement also lend themselves to potential sarcasm, as sarcastic remarks are often short and can be misinterpreted without tone or further context. 

given that this is likely a line from a comedy show and the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, it's more probable that this statement is meant to be understood as sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

not sarcastic

rationale:
the statement ""monica: thank you."" is a simple expression of gratitude. without any additional context or cues suggesting otherwise, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. expressions of thanks are commonly used sincerely in everyday communication. the brevity and straightforwardness of the statement also lend themselves to a literal, non-sarcastic interpretation. while sarcasm is certainly possible in some contexts, we don't have any evidence here to suggest that monica's ""thank you"" is anything other than a genuine expression of appreciation.",0.0

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward request or instruction, likely in a medical or assessment context, without any clear indicators of sarcasm. the follow-up question ""what are you doing?"" seems to express genuine curiosity or surprise rather than a sarcastic tone. the directness of the language and the apparent professional context suggest this is meant to be taken literally rather than sarcastically.",0.0

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration and discomfort from ross about an unwanted situation in his living space. the tone and content are consistent with someone sincerely expressing their desire for privacy and relaxation, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the emotional words and context support a straightforward interpretation of ross's sentiments, making it clear that this is not a sarcastic statement.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""nobody sees the king!"" is a straightforward declarative sentence.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or mockery in the text.
3. the cues don't suggest any contradictory context or hidden meaning that would imply sarcasm.
4. the tone, as suggested in the cues, could be one of secrecy, exclusivity, or frustration, which are all compatible with a literal interpretation of the statement.
5. the topic identified in the cues (""restrictions on access to a king"") aligns with a literal reading of the text.

explanation: chandler's statement ""it's not a real game! i made it up!"" is a direct and honest admission. there's no indication of irony or sarcasm in this declaration. he's straightforwardly confessing that he invented the game, which aligns with the provided context. the exclamatory tone suggests sincerity and possibly frustration or embarrassment at having to reveal the truth, rather than any sarcastic intent.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the context and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
phoebe's statement appears to be a direct, enthusiastic encouragement for someone to join her and others in watching dancers. while the language is blunt and perhaps humorous in its directness, it doesn't contain the hallmarks of sarcasm such as irony, mocking tone, or saying the opposite of what is meant. phoebe seems genuinely trying to persuade someone to come along, using forceful but sincere language.",0.0

 MONICA: Pete, can I get you something else?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement combines a straightforward food order (cheesecake) with an unexpected and humorous request (a date).
2. the phrase ""if you're given' 'em out"" implies a playful, non-serious tone about getting a date, as if it were a menu item.
3. the casual, lighthearted tone and the juxtaposition of ordering food and asking for a date suggest a sarcastic or joking intent.
4. the comment appears to be a form of witty banter or flirtation, rather than a sincere request for a romantic date.

while the sarcasm is mild and playful, the statement does contain an element of irony and humor that is characteristic of sarcastic speech.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a sincere expression of gratitude, even if the thing being thanked for was obvious.
2. phoebe is seeking reassurance, which suggests genuine concern rather than sarcasm.
3. there are no clear indicators of conflicting emotions or exaggerated language that might suggest sarcasm.

explanation:
the input text ""yeah, i don't think so joe"" appears to be a straightforward expression of disagreement or rejection. while the tone may be dismissive or skeptical, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the statement seems to be a direct and literal response, likely to something joe has said or proposed. without additional context that might suggest an ironic or contradictory meaning, it's most appropriate to classify this statement as not sarcastic.",0.0

without additional context, such as the preceding conversation, rachel's body language, tone of voice, or the circumstances surrounding this statement, it's not possible to accurately label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is a simple, direct question from monica.
2. the informal language (""don't 'cha wanna?"") suggests a casual, friendly tone rather than a sarcastic one.
3. there's no apparent contradiction or irony in the statement that would indicate sarcasm.
4. the cues mention a tone of casual eagerness or desire, which aligns with a straightforward, non-sarcastic question.
5. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this appears to be a genuine inquiry rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

 JOEY: How'd you get to that?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the phrase ""your little breakfast adventure"" is a subtle use of sarcasm. chandler is not literally referring to a small, pleasant excursion, but rather using understated language to criticize or mock what was likely a significant incident involving breakfast and angela delvecchio that resulted in damage to furniture. this kind of understated, mocking tone is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially when contrasted with the implied seriousness of the situation.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuine expression of surprise, confusion, or disbelief from rachel about the prospect of staying married forever. the stuttering (""what-wh-what"") and the questioning tone suggest that rachel is genuinely taken aback or overwhelmed by this idea, rather than making a sarcastic remark. the context provided indicates that this is likely part of a serious conversation about marriage and long-term commitment, without any clear indicators of sarcasm or irony.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is a short, simple statement without any clear indicators of sarcasm.
2. the speaker (ross) seems to be genuinely unsure about a suggestion, which is consistent with a straightforward, non-sarcastic response.
3. the phrase ""something girlie"" doesn't inherently carry sarcastic connotations in this context.
4. there's no obvious contrast or irony in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.
5. without additional context or tone indicators, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a literal, non-sarcastic statement.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can make a judgment:

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or confusion followed by an emphatic statement. while the repetition and exclamation marks suggest heightened emotion, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the speaker (ross) seems to be genuinely reacting to a situation, first with confusion and then with a forceful acknowledgment of whatever is happening. without more context, it's difficult to detect any irony or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm. the emotional cues suggest sincere surprise and agitation rather than a sarcastic intent.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

 MONICA: So?!
 JOEY: Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
 MONICA: Yeah huh!!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the information provided and the brief nature of the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this statement is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""cover yourself up!"" is direct and appears to be a genuine instruction or command.
2. the use of an exclamation point suggests urgency or concern, which is more consistent with a sincere request than sarcasm.
3. the context cues indicate that this is likely a straightforward request related to modesty or appropriate dress, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning.
4. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what is meant or using exaggeration for effect, which doesn't seem to be the case here.
5. the brevity of the statement and lack of additional context make it unlikely to be a complex sarcastic remark.

therefore, the statement ""monica: cover yourself up!"" appears to be a non-sarcastic, direct command or urgent request.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and the current cues, i don't have enough context to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the exclamation ""ohhh!!!!"" could be a genuine expression of surprise, excitement, or any other strong emotion, or it could potentially be a sarcastic reaction depending on the broader context.

without more information about the situation, the tone of voice, or the preceding conversation, it's not possible to accurately label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. the safest assumption, given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm, would be:

not sarcastic

the statement by chandler is a clear example of sarcasm. he's using humor to mock the idea that chasing after a churro vendor could be considered jogging. the tone and content of the comment strongly suggest a sarcastic intent, which aligns with the character of chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor.",1.0

 CHANDLER: Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the statement ""well, i'd gotten judy pregnant. i still don't know how that happened."" appears to be a genuine expression of confusion or surprise rather than sarcasm. the speaker seems to be genuinely perplexed about the situation. the emotional words and overall tone suggest bewilderment and uncertainty, which are more indicative of a sincere statement than a sarcastic one. the context doesn't provide any clear indicators of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, this statement is most likely not sarcastic.",0.0

 MONICA: Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given input and the available cues, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the question appears to be a straightforward inquiry about whether something was pain-free as expected.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the short text.
3. the cues suggest this is likely a genuine question about a medical procedure or experience that was supposed to be painless.
4. the tone seems more concerned or curious rather than sarcastic.

without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's most reasonable to interpret this question as sincere rather than sarcastic.",0.0
MONICA: No!,"ROSS: One, two, three, four! You know the song! Sing along! So?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input text ""monica: no!"", i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the exclamation ""no!"" on its own does not provide enough context to indicate sarcasm.

however, considering that sarcasm often requires more nuanced context or a contradictory tone that isn't apparent in this brief statement, i would lean towards classifying this as:

not sarcastic

this classification is based on the assumption that without clear indicators of sarcasm, a straightforward exclamation is more likely to be sincere. however, i want to emphasize that this judgment is made with low confidence due to the lack of context.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided input and cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the statement by phoebe appears to be a straightforward observation about human behavior. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the cues also support this interpretation, describing it as a ""casual observation"" without any emotional contrasts or hidden meanings. therefore, it's most likely a genuine, non-sarcastic comment about how repeating someone's name can get their attention.",0.0

label: sarcastic

this line is clearly meant to be humorous, depicting a character (joey) recounting a mispronunciation of ""butternut squash"" as ""squatternut buash."" the deliberate jumbling of words for comedic effect is a common form of sarcasm, especially in sitcom-style dialogue. the question mark at the end also suggests a tone of disbelief or amusement, further supporting the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0

the input text appears to be a straightforward, enthusiastic invitation from joey to attend a game. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the tone is friendly and excited, with joey expressing agreement (""me too!"") and then extending an invitation. the use of informal language like ""wanna"" further supports the genuine, casual nature of the invitation. given the context and emotional cues provided, this statement can be confidently labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

explanation:
the line appears to be a straightforward request from chandler for a copy of a tape recording. there's no obvious irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm. the phrase ""i don't know if you got any of that"" suggests some uncertainty or awkwardness, but it doesn't imply sarcastic intent. instead, it seems like a genuine, albeit somewhat hesitant, request for information.",0.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the input text appears to be a straightforward clarification from chandler, likely in response to a misunderstanding. the phrase ""oh, no, no"" followed by ""i just meant hypothetically"" indicates that chandler is earnestly trying to explain that his previous statement was not meant to be taken literally. this kind of clarification is typically delivered sincerely to avoid confusion, rather than sarcastically. the cues also support this interpretation, mentioning that chandler seems to be ""clarifying or backtracking on something he said previously"" and ""trying to avoid a misunderstanding."" there are no indicators of irony or sarcasm in this context, suggesting that chandler's statement is straightforward and not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this dialogue is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the emotional cue indicates a positive sentiment with the word ""like"".
2. the context suggests joey is genuinely expressing appreciation for something and handing it over.
3. there's no indication of contrasting emotions or hidden meanings that would suggest sarcasm.
4. the straightforward nature of the statement ""i like it"" followed by ""here you go"" implies sincerity rather than sarcasm.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, in this case, the simplicity and directness of joey's statement, combined with the action of giving something, points towards a genuine, non-sarcastic interaction.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic due to the contrast between phoebe's stated intention and the underlying implication. while she says she wants to appear ""totally ok"" with seeing someone, the very act of leaving to create this impression suggests she's not actually comfortable. the exaggerated language (""totally ok"") and the somewhat convoluted logic of leaving to prove comfort further point to sarcasm. this kind of self-aware, ironic comment about social behavior is often delivered sarcastically, especially in the context of a sitcom character like phoebe.",1.0

explanation:
the single line of dialogue ""monica: and did he?"" is a straightforward question without any indicators of sarcasm. the cues provided emphasize that this short text lacks emotional content, context, or any clear indicators that would suggest sarcasm. it's a neutral question seeking information, which is typically not characteristic of sarcastic speech. without additional context or tone indicators, there's no reason to interpret this as anything other than a literal, non-sarcastic inquiry.",0.0

explanation:
the statement ""you're gonna have to tell me how you did that"" appears to be a straightforward request for information. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. rachel seems genuinely curious or impressed by something someone else has done and is asking for an explanation. the cues also support this interpretation, noting that the statement is neutral in tone and expresses curiosity or interest. without any contradictory context or tone indicators, this statement is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the very short input text ""phoebe: no"", there is not enough context or information to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the text is too brief to contain any clear indicators of sarcasm, emotional contrasts, or hidden meanings.

therefore, the most appropriate label for this input would be:

not sarcastic

this label is assigned because sarcasm typically requires more context or a more elaborate statement to be identifiable. a simple ""no"" response, without any additional context or tone indicators, is most likely to be taken at face value as a straightforward negative response.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit casual, description of a relationship. chandler is directly expressing his perception of the situation without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the use of phrases like ""we're nothing"" and ""goofin' around"" aligns with the cues suggesting a casual, nonchalant attitude. while there might be underlying emotions or implications, the statement itself does not contain sarcastic elements.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward expression of emotion rather than sarcasm. phoebe is directly stating that she is still angry, even after acknowledging something the other person said (indicated by ""uh-huh, well!""). the hesitation in her speech (""but umm, still i'm-i'm mad at you"") suggests genuine emotion rather than a sarcastic remark. the context provided in the cues also supports this interpretation, describing it as an expression of maintained anger in an interpersonal conflict situation.",0.0

not sarcastic

rationale:
the exclamation ""paper cut!"" appears to be a genuine reaction to experiencing a minor but painful injury. paper cuts, while small, can be surprisingly painful and often elicit such spontaneous reactions. there's no clear indication of irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the character chandler is likely expressing genuine discomfort or surprise at getting a paper cut, which is a common and relatable experience. without additional context suggesting a sarcastic intent, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a straightforward, non-sarcastic exclamation.",0.0

label: sarcastic

the sudden shift from chandler asking for a moment to wake up to an exaggerated ""ah-ha-ha!!"" strongly suggests sarcasm. this abrupt change from a drowsy state to an over-the-top reaction is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic humor in the show ""friends."" the contrast between his initial request for time to wake up and the immediate, exaggerated laughter creates a humorous effect that is characteristic of sarcastic delivery.",1.0

sarcastic

the exclamation ""all right, okay, well, apparently not!"" strongly suggests a sarcastic tone. the use of ""apparently"" in this context typically indicates that something has not turned out as expected, and the speaker is expressing frustration or disappointment in a sarcastic manner. the multiple interjections (""all right, okay, well"") followed by the contrasting statement further reinforces the sarcastic delivery. this kind of response is often used to sarcastically acknowledge that a previous assumption or expectation was incorrect.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given context and rachel's response, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

rachel's statement ""that's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed"" carries a sarcastic tone. she's using irony to point out that the other person's perspective or advice is coming from a place of not having experienced the dangerous situation she just went through. the phrase ""that's easy for you to say"" is often used sarcastically to highlight that someone's opinion is disconnected from the reality or difficulty of a situation. in this case, rachel is emphasizing the gap between her recent near-death experience and the other person's presumably safer position, using sarcasm to express her frustration or disagreement with their comment.",1.0

3. the tone appears to be straightforward and literal.
4. without additional context, the statement seems to be a genuine expression of phoebe's opinion.

while sarcasm often relies on context and tone that may not be apparent in text alone, this particular statement doesn't have any typical markers of sarcasm (such as exaggeration, obvious irony, or contradictory elements). therefore, based on the limited information available, it's more likely to be a non-sarcastic statement.",0.0

the statement appears to be the beginning of a potentially negative description of someone's friend, but it cuts off before we can understand the full meaning or tone. without more context from the surrounding conversation or scene, it's impossible to determine if chandler is being genuinely critical or employing sarcasm.

therefore, i would assign the label:

the tone of ross's statement, particularly the use of the slang term ""bitchin'"" in this context, suggests a sarcastic or ironic response. he's asking what was meant to be shown, implying that whatever it was isn't visible or noteworthy, and instead humorously focusing on an unrelated van. the contrast between the expectation of being shown something specific and ross's exaggerated praise of an unrelated van strongly indicates sarcasm.",1.0

however, if i must choose a label based solely on this limited information, i would lean towards:

not sarcastic

this is because:

1. ""lovely"" is inherently a positive word.
2. without clear indicators of sarcasm (like an obviously negative situation or a known sarcastic character), it's generally safer to interpret statements literally.
3. the cues provided don't give any additional context that would suggest sarcasm.

keep in mind that this label could easily be incorrect if more context were available. sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, situation, and broader context, none of which are provided here.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and the current cues provided, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a genuine expression of self-reflection.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.
3. the tone seems sincere and introspective, which is typically not associated with sarcasm.
4. the cues mention that the text is reflective and introspective, without detecting any emotional contrasts or overt emotions that might suggest sarcasm.
5. the topic is identified as personal reflection, which is generally a serious subject not prone to sarcastic treatment in this context.

therefore, the most appropriate label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

not sarcastic

the text ""phoebe: why?"" is a simple, straightforward question without any context or additional information that would suggest sarcasm. it's a neutral inquiry that doesn't contain any of the typical markers of sarcastic speech, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradiction. the cues also support this interpretation, emphasizing the lack of context and the inability to extract any emotional contrasts or specific tone from this brief statement.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

the provided line ""oh-oh, that's a risky little game!"" spoken by rachel does not appear to be sarcastic. based on the available cues and the content of the statement, it seems to be a genuine expression of concern or warning about a potentially dangerous situation or behavior. 

the exclamation ""oh-oh"" typically indicates surprise or worry, and the description of something as a ""risky little game"" suggests rachel is genuinely cautioning about the potential dangers involved. without additional context that might suggest an ironic or mocking tone, it's most reasonable to interpret this statement as a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment.",0.0

the line could express genuine frustration or disbelief, which would not be sarcastic. alternatively, it could be delivered in a sarcastic tone to express mockery or irony, but we don't have enough information to make that determination. therefore, i cannot assign a definitive label to this input with the limited information provided.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement expresses a subtle form of sarcasm. phoebe's comment about only doing ""pregnant stuff"" and it bumming her out highlights the contrast between the expectation that pregnancy should be an exciting time and her actual feelings of frustration or boredom. the use of the phrase ""all i ever get to do"" is an exaggeration that adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that pregnancy has completely taken over her life to the point of excluding everything else, which she finds disappointing. this aligns with the emotional contrast described in the cues, reinforcing the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text shows rachel speaking in a flustered, repetitive manner that indicates genuine distress or denial. her stammering and repeated use of ""no"" suggest she is sincerely upset or disagreeing with something. this kind of emotional, disjointed speech is typically associated with authentic reactions rather than sarcasm, which often involves more deliberate, controlled language use. the lack of any obvious irony or contrast between what's said and what's meant further supports that this is not a sarcastic statement.",0.0

however, given that we need to choose a label, i'll make an educated guess based on the limited information:

the statement is a straightforward revelation of a personal and potentially emotional truth. phoebe is disclosing important information about her family history and identity. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the context provided also supports this interpretation, highlighting the complexity and potential emotional weight of the situation. therefore, this statement is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a direct quote from the character chandler, likely from the tv show ""friends.""
2. chandler is explaining or defending his position regarding janice, a recurring character in the show.
3. the tone of the statement seems earnest and defensive rather than sarcastic. chandler is trying to make a point that his reaction to janice wasn't due to him being overly selective or picky.
4. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory statements.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward justification for not leaving a social situation.
2. there's no clear contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm.
3. the context provided suggests chandler is genuinely trying to convince someone to stay, citing social etiquette as a reason.
4. the tone seems sincere in considering others' feelings (""it would be rude to them""), which doesn't align with typical sarcastic intent.
5. without additional context indicating chandler's typical speech patterns or the full situation, there's no strong evidence to suggest this statement is sarcastic.

 RACHEL: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
",FRIENDS,0,"given the input text and the current cues provided, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

### label: sarcastic

the statement ""twenty-one hours, you're a hero"" is likely sarcastic. here's why:

1. the phrase uses hyperbole by equating staying awake for 21 hours with being a ""hero,"" which is an exaggeration.

2. there's an implied contrast between the relatively mundane act of staying awake for 21 hours and the grandiose label of ""hero,"" which is typically reserved for more significant acts of bravery or selflessness.

3. the statement seems to mock or critique the idea that merely staying awake for an extended period is worthy of heroic praise.

4. in everyday context, people often use sarcasm to comment on situations where someone is overly proud of a minor accomplishment, which this statement appears to be doing.

the sarcastic tone is achieved by using the positive word ""hero"" in a context where it's clearly mismatched with the action described, creating an ironic effect typical of sarcastic statements.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i don't have enough context to confidently determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the text is too brief and lacks sufficient context to make a reliable judgment about the presence of sarcasm. 

without more information about the conversation's tone, the relationship between the speakers, or the broader context, it's not possible to accurately label this as either 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'. the statement could be a straightforward description of events or could potentially have a sarcastic undertone, but there's not enough evidence to make that determination.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: not sarcastic

this statement by ross appears to be a genuine attempt to provide comfort or perspective, rather than a sarcastic remark. the contrast between potential current difficulties and future joy is presented sincerely, emphasizing the love one will feel for their child. the tone and content suggest a supportive, forward-looking sentiment without any apparent irony or mockery that would indicate sarcasm.",0.0
RACHEL: That is the coast guard!,"JOEY: Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a simple, declarative exclamation.
2. there's no apparent contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
3. the context suggests rachel is likely pointing out or identifying the coast guard in a straightforward manner.
4. there are no emotional words or clear emotional contrasts that might indicate sarcasm.
5. the statement aligns with common knowledge about the coast guard without any apparent irony or exaggeration.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic observation or identification of the coast guard.",0.0

 MONICA: Oh my God! Oh my God!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the statement ""ah well, this is the living room"" appears to be a straightforward, neutral introduction of a room during a house tour. there's no indication of sarcasm or irony in the text or the contextual cues provided. the phrase ""ah well"" might indicate a mild sense of resignation or a casual transition, but it doesn't suggest sarcasm in this context. the overall tone seems informative and matter-of-fact, consistent with showing someone around a living space.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the limited context provided in the input text and the current cues, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether this statement is sarcastic or not. however, given the emphasis implied by the exclamation mark and the phrase ""even if,"" which suggests a contrast or unexpected situation, there's a slight possibility of sarcasm.

that said, without more context about the conversation and rachel's tone or intent, i cannot confidently assign a label. if forced to choose, i would lean towards:

label: not sarcastic

this is because sarcasm typically requires more context to be clearly identifiable, and this single line doesn't provide strong indicators of sarcasm. however, i want to emphasize that this judgment is made with low confidence due to the lack of surrounding context.",0.0
ROSS: I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I,"ROSS: Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided input and the current cues, i don't have enough context to determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the text appears to be a sincere apology from a character named ross, who is stammering and seems to be genuinely remorseful. however, without more context about the situation or the tone in which this is delivered, it's not possible to definitively label this as sarcastic or not sarcastic.

given the limited information, the most likely label would be:

not sarcastic

this is because the statement appears to be a straightforward apology, and there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the brief text provided. the stuttering ""i-i'm"" suggests genuine emotion rather than a sarcastic tone. however, i want to emphasize that this judgment is made with limited context and could be incorrect if there are additional contextual factors not present in the given text.",0.0
"JOEY: Yeah well that's because uh .. I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.","RACHEL: Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
 JOEY: Yeah me too, all night. Really?!
 RACHEL: How come we didn't cross paths?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given context and joey's statement, i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

the statement appears to be sarcastic because:

1. joey is using a humorous exaggeration about the state of his laundry hamper to explain his absence or lack of interaction.

2. the phrase ""you don't want to look in my hamper"" is likely an understatement, implying that the condition of his laundry is so bad that it would be shocking or unpleasant to see.

3. this kind of self-deprecating humor about one's cleanliness or habits is often delivered with a sarcastic tone.

4. the use of ""uh"" and the way he adds the hamper comment suggests he's making a joke rather than being entirely serious about his situation.

the sarcasm here is mild and self-directed, used to make light of his own laziness or messiness, which is a common form of sarcastic humor in casual conversation.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the available cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward statement from rachel addressing another person.
2. there's no clear indication of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that typically characterizes sarcasm.
3. the phrase ""being one of the two of us"" suggests a shared experience or knowledge, which seems to be stated matter-of-factly rather than sarcastically.
4. without additional context or tone indicators, the statement comes across as a genuine, albeit somewhat obvious, observation.

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, there isn't enough evidence in this isolated statement to confidently label it as sarcastic. therefore, the safer classification is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the cues mention this is likely a humorous exchange.
2. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"".
3. the question ""you building a post office?"" seems out of place and exaggerated, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic comments.
4. without more context, it's likely chandler is making a sarcastic remark about someone doing something that probably doesn't resemble building a post office, but he's exaggerating for comedic effect.

while the text itself is brief, chandler's character and the nature of the question suggest this is most likely a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine inquiry.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

the statement ""ross: stick to the list."" appears to be a straightforward instruction or reminder without any obvious sarcastic elements. the cues suggest this is likely a line of dialogue from a character named ross, giving a direct instruction to adhere to a predetermined list. without additional context that might indicate a sarcastic tone or intent, it's most appropriate to interpret this statement as literal and not sarcastic.",0.0

1. the text is a simple, straightforward question from monica asking what someone is up to.
2. there are no indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory context.
3. this type of question is commonly used in casual conversation as a genuine inquiry about someone's current activities.
4. the cues mention that there's no emotional contrast or loaded emotional words, which are often present in sarcastic statements.

the input text appears to be a genuine expression of concern or surprise from monica about someone's facial appearance. the use of an exclamation mark and question mark emphasizes her alarm or worry. there's no indication of irony, mockery, or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the cues also support this interpretation, noting that the line expresses surprise or concern about someone's face without any contrasting emotions or sarcastic undertones.",0.0

explanation:
the statement ""joey: no just, nobody press on my stomach."" appears to be a straightforward request from joey. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the cues indicate that joey is likely experiencing discomfort or pain in his stomach area and is sincerely asking others not to apply pressure to it. the context and tone of the statement align with a genuine, literal request rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the single line of dialogue ""ross: if you wanna put a label on it."" does not contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a neutral statement, possibly in response to someone else's comment or question about categorizing something. the phrase is commonly used when someone is reluctant to define or categorize something precisely, but is leaving it up to others if they want to do so. without more context, there's no evidence of irony, mocking tone, or contradiction that would typically indicate sarcasm. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this statement as not sarcastic.",0.0

 PERSON: No you answer it and take pledges.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
while the statement itself doesn't contain obvious sarcasm, the context clues suggest that joey's exclamation is likely sarcastic. the cues indicate a sense of surprise, indignation, and contrast between joey's expectation of being in charge and some unstated situation that contradicts this. the use of ""but"" at the beginning of the statement further implies that something has happened to challenge joey's role as the host.

in sitcoms or comedic contexts, characters often use sarcasm to highlight absurd situations or express frustration. joey emphatically stating ""but i'm the host!"" in a situation where his authority is apparently being undermined or ignored suggests he's likely using sarcasm to point out the ridiculousness of the situation.

without more context, we can't be absolutely certain, but given the emotional undertones and the implied contradiction between joey's stated role and the apparent circumstances, sarcasm seems to be the most probable interpretation of this statement.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

the input text appears to be a sarcastic comment from the character chandler. the line ""it'll cost you one husband"" is a playful, exaggerated response that is not meant to be taken literally, which is characteristic of sarcasm. chandler's character is known for his witty and sarcastic remarks, further supporting this interpretation. the context and tone of the statement strongly suggest it is meant to be humorous rather than sincere, fitting the ""sarcastic"" label.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

the exaggerated enthusiasm, the overcompensation in monica's response, and the use of emphatic phrases like ""nooo!"" and ""best time ever!"" strongly suggest that this dialogue is sarcastic. the cues also point out that monica seems to be overcompensating or exaggerating her positive reaction, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic speech. the final exclamation ""yeah, you rocked my world!"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone, as it appears to be an over-the-top positive statement that likely contradicts her true feelings.",1.0

 ROSS: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
 PHOEBE: Oh, it's not!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of ""seriously"" suggests genuine emphasis rather than sarcasm.
2. the exclamation mark indicates genuine surprise or urgency.
3. there's no context or tone that suggests rachel is being ironic or saying the opposite of what she means.
4. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of excitement or alarm about something moving.

without additional context that might suggest otherwise, rachel's statement seems to be a sincere exclamation rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward piece of dialogue, with joey speaking to phoebe about christmas-related activities or obligations. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief snippet. joey seems to be genuinely trying to remind or reassure phoebe about something related to christmas, rather than using sarcasm.",0.0

 ROSS: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

this label is based on several factors:

1. the repetition of ""no, no, no"" suggests an emphatic denial, which can often be a prelude to sarcasm.

2. the contrast between the strong denial and the use of the word ""flattery"" implies a potential mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning.

3. in sitcoms and comedic contexts (which this dialogue snippet likely comes from, given the character name ""ross""), such a statement is often delivered with sarcastic intent.

4. the abrupt shift from denial to ""it's flattery"" without further explanation can be indicative of sarcasm, where the speaker is saying the opposite of what they mean.

5. while flattery is typically positive, the context and delivery here suggest that ross might be sarcastically calling something flattery when it's actually an insult or criticism.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the tone, situation, and preceding dialogue, this interpretation is based on common patterns of sarcastic speech rather than definitive evidence.",1.0

 PHOEBE: Ohh! You made up!
 MONICA: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

the input text is very likely to be sarcastic. here's why:

1. context: this appears to be a line from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.

2. phrasing: the use of ""chan love"" is a playful, exaggerated way of referring to himself, which is typical of chandler's character and his sarcastic style.

3. tone: the statement is overly confident and grandiose, which contrasts with chandler's usual self-doubt, indicating he's likely being ironic.

4. character trait: chandler frequently uses sarcasm when discussing relationships or his appeal to women, often as a defense mechanism.

given these factors, it's highly probable that chandler is not being sincere, but rather using sarcasm to humorously comment on a situation involving a woman's interest in him, likely downplaying or mocking the idea that someone would be intensely attracted to him.",1.0

 ROSE: I'll be fine
 BLANCHE: Is this about Arnie?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward explanation from dorothy to blanche about why someone is upset.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would indicate sarcasm.
3. the context aligns with a real historical event (the change in coca-cola's formula), which suggests this is likely a sincere statement.
4. the emotional tone (someone being ""upset"") is consistent with a genuine reaction to a change in a popular product.
5. the dialogue style seems direct and informative, without any hints of mockery or double meaning that might suggest sarcasm.

therefore, this statement appears to be a literal, non-sarcastic explanation of someone's distress over changes to coca-cola's taste.",0.0
"DOROTHY: No Rose, she is depressed because Marvel had manners on only once a week","DOROTHY: Now PERSON is depressed Rose.
 ROSE: Do you think she is depressed about Rebecca
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

the input text is likely sarcastic. the reason given for someone being depressed - ""because marvel had manners on only once a week"" - is absurd and not a realistic cause of depression. this kind of exaggeration and nonsensical explanation is a common hallmark of sarcasm. the statement appears to be making light of or mocking either the person's depression or the notion of attributing depression to trivial causes. the use of ""marvel"" (possibly referring to the entertainment company) having ""manners on"" only once a week is clearly not meant to be taken literally, further supporting the sarcastic tone.",1.0

 DOROTHY: Oh you're sure I am
 ROSE: Are you nervous cause you haven't met Michael's fiancee?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement contains clear elements of sarcasm, including an exaggerated and absurd scenario presented as a reason for nervousness. the contrast between the stated emotion (nervousness) and the ridiculous imagined consequence (sonny bono making postmen wear outlandish outfits) is a classic hallmark of sarcastic humor. this type of exaggerated, unlikely scenario is often used in sitcoms or comedy shows for comedic effect, further supporting the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0
"DOROTHY: Oh yes Blanche, about a half hour ago. But now I have hidden her again so you can find her.","BLANCHE: Have you found her?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"not sarcastic

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward, literal statement without any indicators of sarcasm. dorothy is explaining to blanche that she had hidden something (or someone) earlier, and has now hidden it again for blanche to find. the tone seems matter-of-fact and informative, consistent with describing a hide-and-seek game or similar activity. there are no contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 DOROTHY: I think she will be happy with Gloria
 ROSE: What about us? Whose gonna keep after us. Make us linguini and tell us story about Cicily.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

the context and content of this line strongly suggest it is meant to be sarcastic. here's why:

1. the speculative nature of the comment (""maybe mary poppins has an italian cousin"") is absurd and unlikely, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic statements.

2. mary poppins is a well-known fictional character, and suddenly suggesting she has an italian cousin out of nowhere seems to be a playful or mocking response to something rose might have said previously.

3. the tone of the statement, particularly starting with ""i don't know, rose,"" suggests a level of exasperation or dismissiveness that often accompanies sarcastic remarks.

4. in the context of what appears to be a comedic dialogue (likely from a tv show or movie), such an unexpected and silly suggestion about a famous character is typically meant to be humorous through sarcasm.

5. the juxtaposition of the proper english nanny mary poppins with the idea of an italian cousin creates a cultural contrast that's likely meant to be amusing in a sarcastic way.

while we don't have the full context of the conversation, the nature of this statement strongly points to it being a sarcastic remark rather than a genuine suggestion or belief.",1.0

rationale:
the input ""dorothy: on the home shopping network"" appears to be a simple, factual statement or perhaps a stage direction indicating where a character named dorothy is located. there's no clear indication of sarcasm, irony, or any emotional contrast that would suggest sarcastic intent. the statement aligns with the common knowledge about home shopping networks being television channels for selling products. without additional context or tone indicators, this statement seems to be straightforward and literal, hence not sarcastic.",0.0

explanation:
the sentence contains nonsensical elements (""crocodin turbs"") and an absurd reason for being upset (these imaginary things ""wearing darker colors""). this combination of made-up concepts and an exaggerated emotional response to something trivial and non-existent is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is likely using this ridiculous statement to express frustration or mock something in a humorous way, rather than genuinely being upset about fictional creatures' fashion choices.",1.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided input and context cues, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward description of a marquee at caesar's palace, likely referring to liberace (with a misspelling).
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions.
3. the context provided doesn't suggest any hidden meaning or intent beyond a simple observation.
4. while the name ""dorothy"" is included, it doesn't provide any additional context that would suggest sarcasm.

the statement seems to be a neutral, factual observation about a sign or display at a well-known las vegas casino, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.",0.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the given input and the current cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the statement by dorothy appears to be a straightforward expression of confusion or difficulty in understanding commercials for the perfume ""obsession."" there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. dorothy is simply stating her genuine inability to comprehend the advertisements, which is a common reaction to abstract or avant-garde perfume commercials. the tone seems sincere and literal, without any hidden or opposite meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0.0
"DOROTHY: No, I am depressed becaues Phillis George left the morning news.","ROSE: Are you depressed about Glen?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the input and the cues provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the statement is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. there's an emotional contrast between the stated depression and the trivial reason given for it (a news anchor leaving a show).

2. it's unlikely that someone would be genuinely depressed over a tv personality change, making the exaggerated reaction a hallmark of sarcasm.

3. the cues highlight this contrast between depression and implied happiness, which is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

4. the specificity of mentioning phillis george, a real former cbs morning news co-anchor, adds to the sarcastic tone by referencing a relatively minor media event as a cause for depression.

this statement appears to be using hyperbole (claiming depression over a small matter) to make a sarcastic comment about the importance people might place on television personalities or changes in their favorite shows.",1.0
"DOROTHY: No Blanche, with a venus fly trap","DOROTHY: Morning everybody, Rose honey I hope you don't mind, I borrowed your golf club, I have a date to play this morning.
 BLANCHE: With a man?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the limited context provided in the single line of dialogue, i don't have enough information to confidently determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. the line ""no blanche, with a venus fly trap"" could be a straightforward response in a conversation about plants, or it could potentially be a sarcastic remark depending on the broader context and tone of the conversation.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the absence of additional context, i would lean towards labeling this as:

not sarcastic

this appears to be a straightforward line of dialogue without any clear indicators of sarcasm. dorothy is giving a direct instruction to rose, and there's no obvious irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcastic intent. without additional context or tone indicators, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a genuine, non-sarcastic instruction.",0.0

the input text ""dorothy: lords of arabia"" appears to be a title or heading, likely for a book, film, or other media. based on the current cues and the brevity of the input, there's no indication of sarcasm. titles are typically straightforward and meant to be descriptive or intriguing rather than sarcastic. without additional context or content that might suggest a sarcastic tone or intent, the most appropriate label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the available cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement expresses a genuine emotion of worry.
2. there's no obvious contrast between what is said and what is meant.
3. the tone appears to be straightforward and sincere.
4. the context suggests a serious conversation about someone's potential association, which doesn't lend itself to sarcasm.
5. the use of ""worried"" aligns with the overall concerned tone of the statement.

while sarcasm can be subtle, there are no clear indicators of sarcastic intent in this short statement. dorothy seems to be expressing a genuine concern without any apparent irony or mocking tone.",0.0
"DOROTHY: Oh ma no, it was a little girl selling girl scout toilets.","DOROTHY: Oh fine we will!
 SOPHIA: Is that Paolo?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this input is:

sarcastic

the reason for this judgment is:

1. the statement contains an absurd element - ""girl scout toilets"" - which is clearly not a real product sold by girl scouts. this unexpected and humorous substitution of ""toilets"" for the expected ""cookies"" is a common technique in sarcastic humor.

2. the context provided suggests this is part of a conversation where dorothy is correcting a misunderstanding, but does so in a way that introduces an even more ridiculous concept.

3. the phrasing ""oh ma no"" followed by this absurd statement suggests a deadpan or matter-of-fact delivery of something clearly untrue, which is characteristic of sarcastic speech.

4. the incongruity between the expectation of girl scouts selling cookies and the stated ""toilets"" creates a humorous effect typical of sarcasm.

therefore, while the statement itself doesn't contain traditional markers of sarcasm like exaggerated language or obvious emotional contrasts, the absurdity and humor in the unexpected substitution strongly suggest a sarcastic intent.",1.0
"DOROTHY: No, I haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.","PERSON: Sophia was discharged, is she here?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward, literal response without any obvious indicators of sarcasm. the speaker, dorothy, is directly answering a question or addressing a concern about someone or something still being in the trunk of a car. while the situation described might be unusual or concerning depending on the broader context, the statement itself doesn't contain any typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's most appropriate to interpret this statement as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 ROSE: Dorothy, should I get Sophia a glass of water?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

the statement by dorothy has a clear sarcastic tone. she's not genuinely suggesting that rose should watch someone cough severely (""hack herself to death""). instead, she's using exaggeration and a dismissive attitude to express frustration or annoyance with the situation. this kind of hyperbolic, insensitive suggestion is a common form of sarcasm, especially in dialogue.",1.0

 SOPHIA: Are you referring to me?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is clearly absurd and not meant to be taken literally. the idea of cary grant (a famous actor) living in a broom closet is ridiculous and impossible (especially considering he passed away in 1986).

2. the use of ""of course"" at the beginning suggests a tone of exaggeration or mock seriousness, which is common in sarcastic statements.

3. the context implies this is likely a response to a question or statement from ""ma,"" and dorothy is using an extreme, impossible example to make a point or express frustration, which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. while there are no explicitly emotional words, the overall content and structure of the sentence strongly indicate sarcastic intent.

therefore, this statement can be confidently labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

sarcastic

the text presents a series of outrageous and inappropriate behaviors in the context of what is likely meant to be a more formal or respectable new year's eve gathering. dorothy's statement is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a sarcastic and confrontational remark, likely in response to someone's behavior or suggestion. the extreme nature of the described actions, combined with the matter-of-fact way they are presented, strongly indicates sarcasm.",1.0

1. the line appears to be a straightforward instruction from dorothy to someone else to show slides of hawaii.
2. there's no clear indication of irony, mockery, or underlying meaning that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the context suggests this is likely part of a normal conversation or presentation about a trip to hawaii.

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a genuine expression of concern from the character dorothy about michael jackson potentially purchasing the remains of the elephant man. while the topic itself is unusual, there's no evident irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm. the use of ""worried"" indicates sincere emotion, and the statement aligns with the historical context of michael jackson's real-life interest in acquiring the elephant man's remains. therefore, this statement is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"given the limited context and the analysis provided in the current cues, i believe the most appropriate label for this input is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is very brief and straightforward, simply mentioning a cappuccino maker.
2. there's no evident contrast, exaggeration, or irony that would typically indicate sarcasm.
3. the cues analysis doesn't reveal any emotional content or contextual information that might suggest sarcasm.
4. without additional context, it appears to be a neutral statement about someone's possession of a cappuccino maker.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, there's not enough information here to confidently label this as sarcastic. therefore, the safer and more likely classification is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
"DOROTHY: No, she I supset because Jimmy Swaager can't cover his motel bill","ROSE: But I am still upset.
 BLANCHE: Are you upset because you don't know what to do about Al?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the contrast between someone being very upset (""supset"", likely meant to be ""upset"") and the seemingly trivial reason (jimmy swaggart not being able to pay a motel bill) suggests irony.

2. the situation described is absurd and likely exaggerated for comedic effect, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

3. the reference to jimmy swaggart, a well-known televangelist, not being able to pay a motel bill implies a criticism or mockery of his public image versus private actions, which is often a target for sarcastic comments.

4. the misspellings in the text (""supset"" for ""upset"" and ""swaager"" for ""swaggart"") could be intentional to add to the humorous or mocking tone of the statement.

while sarcasm can be difficult to detect without more context or tone of voice, the elements present in this statement strongly suggest a sarcastic intent rather than a literal one.",1.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the available information and context provided, i don't have enough evidence to confidently label this statement as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the single line of dialogue ""dorothy: no it's the rose in the kitchen thing."" lacks sufficient context to determine if it's meant sarcastically or sincerely. without more information about the conversation, the speaker's tone, or the situation being discussed, it's not possible to accurately discern the presence or absence of sarcasm. therefore, i cannot assign a reliable label of either ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input.",0.0

sarcastic

the context suggests that dorothy is responding sarcastically to something blanche said about time passing quickly. by asking if blanche meant ""dog years,"" dorothy is using sarcasm to humorously challenge or mock blanche's perception of time. this kind of witty, sarcastic banter is typical in comedic exchanges, especially when discussing topics like aging or the passage of time.",1.0

the input text appears to be a punchline or witty response, likely part of a joke or playful exchange. the use of wordplay with ""sunbrella"" (combining ""sun"" and ""umbrella"") and the name ""rose"" (which could refer to both a flower and a person) suggests a humorous, clever tone that is characteristic of sarcasm. the structure of the sentence as an explanation (""because..."") also fits the pattern of a sarcastic response to a question. while not all humor is sarcasm, this particular combination of elements - wordplay, clever response, and the setup as an explanation - leans towards a sarcastic interpretation in the context of casual conversation or light-hearted dialogue.",1.0
DOROTHY: What was I doing? My ben gazara in person?,"SOPHIA: Probably just misses her mother.
 SOPHIA: It needs to hear a feminine voice.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i don't have enough context to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the text appears to be a line of dialogue from a character named dorothy, possibly expressing confusion or surprise about something related to ben gazzara. without more context about the situation or the tone in which this is being said, it's difficult to ascertain whether sarcasm is intended.

however, if i must choose a label, i would lean towards:

not sarcastic

the reason for this choice is that the statement seems to be a genuine question expressing confusion, rather than an obviously ironic or sarcastic remark. dorothy appears to be asking about something she was doing, possibly related to meeting ben gazzara in person. without clear indicators of sarcasm or irony, it's safer to assume the statement is meant to be taken at face value.",0.0

explanation:
the input text ""dorothy: what are these? claws?"" appears to be a genuine question from a character named dorothy. she seems to be inquiring about something she's observing, possibly for the first time. the tone of the question suggests curiosity or confusion, rather than sarcasm. there are no contextual clues or linguistic markers that would indicate a sarcastic intent. the straightforward nature of the question and the lack of any contradictory or exaggerated elements further support that this is a sincere inquiry, not a sarcastic remark.",0.0

3. the word ""amazing"" is generally used to express genuine positive emotion or admiration.
4. none of the cues indicate any contrasting emotions or hidden meanings that might suggest sarcasm.

",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"based on the given input and cues, i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of repeated ""really"" (""really really looking forward"") is often a marker of exaggeration used in sarcastic statements.

2. the context of a moderator addressing someone in front of an audience suggests a formal or semi-formal setting where overt enthusiasm might be seen as insincere or exaggerated.

3. the phrase ""i am sure we are all..."" is sometimes used sarcastically to imply the opposite - that perhaps not everyone is actually looking forward to the story.

4. while the statement could be genuine, the combination of these elements, particularly the emphatic repetition, leans more towards a sarcastic interpretation in many contexts.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the tone, setting, or relationship between the speakers, this interpretation is based on common linguistic markers of sarcasm rather than absolute certainty.",1.0

sarcastic

this text displays clear sarcastic elements:

1. the use of ""screwups"" to refer to group members is negative and likely not sincere for a moderator.
2. the phrase ""for the good of my health"" is almost certainly sarcastic, as moderating a difficult group is unlikely to be beneficial to one's health.
3. the exaggerated statement about giving up ""every tuesday of my life"" adds to the sarcastic tone.
4. the repetition of ""no"" at the beginning suggests frustration and sets up the sarcastic comments that follow.

the combination of these elements, along with the overall frustrated tone noted in the cues, strongly indicates that this statement is sarcastic.",1.0

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the ambiguity of the single-word response, i would lean towards labeling this as:

not sarcastic

",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the text is clearly employing sarcasm, which is evident from several factors:

1. context: the mention of a ""sarcasmoholics meeting"" sets up an ironic situation, as it's a fictional concept.

2. rhetorical question: the speaker is asking about the presence of sarcasm at a meeting specifically for people addicted to sarcasm, which is inherently ironic.

3. tone: the question implies mock surprise at finding sarcasm in a place where it would be expected, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

3. the tone appears genuinely supportive and encouraging.

",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"given the context and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
the moderator's statement ""and i am sure every person here really really wants you to join our group"" has several indicators of sarcasm:

1. overemphasis: the use of ""really really"" is an exaggeration that often signals sarcasm.
2. tone: the statement seems overly enthusiastic in a way that could be interpreted as insincere.
3. context: in a professional or formal setting, such an exaggerated statement about group enthusiasm would be unusual, suggesting it's not meant to be taken literally.
4. implication: the statement implies an unrealistic level of unanimous excitement from the group, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic statements.

the combination of these factors strongly suggests that the moderator is using sarcasm, likely to humorously downplay or mock the idea that everyone in the group would be unanimously and extremely excited about a new member joining.",1.0

2. the cues suggest that the expression ""noo.."" conveys genuine disappointment, dismay, or distress.
3. there's no indication of irony or contrast that typically characterizes sarcasm.
4. the elongated ""oo"" and double period "".."" emphasize emotional intensity, which is more consistent with sincere expression rather than sarcasm.

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by chandler is clearly a sarcastic remark. he's using exaggerated cowboy/horse imagery (saddle bags, chewing hay) in a context where it's likely out of place, which is a classic sarcastic technique. this fits with the cue that it's a ""sarcastic comment about horses or cowboy-related items."" the tone and absurdity of the suggestion further reinforce that this is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a sarcastic quip.",1.0

"CHANDLER: Let me think! Let me think! Oh, I don't care.","JOEY: The wheel or pick a Google card.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and my analysis of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
this line exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. exaggeration: the repeated ""let me think!"" is an exaggerated display of contemplation.
2. sudden shift: there's an abrupt change from apparent deep thought to complete disinterest.
3. contrast: the initial effort of thinking hard is contrasted with the casual dismissal at the end.
4. tone: the overall tone suggests frustration or exasperation, which is often conveyed through sarcasm.

the character chandler (possibly from the tv show ""friends"") is known for his sarcastic humor, which further supports this interpretation. the line appears to mock the process of careful consideration by dramatically building up to a point of feigned reflection, only to immediately dismiss it with ""oh, i don't care."" this sudden reversal is a hallmark of sarcastic delivery.",1.0
CHANDLER: The British are coming?,"PHOEBE: Hey you guys, guess what?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this dialogue is:

sarcastic

reasoning:

2. the phrase ""the british are coming?"" is a reference to a famous historical quote, but it's being used as a question in an apparently modern context.
3. the cues mention that this phrase is often used humorously or sarcastically in popular culture.
4. the question mark at the end suggests a tone of disbelief or mockery, which is consistent with sarcasm.
5. without more context, it appears chandler is likely making a sarcastic comment about something unexpected happening, using the historical reference ironically.

therefore, given chandler's character and the nature of the reference, this line is most likely intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i believe this label is reliable based on the provided cues and context. the rapid shift in emotions from extreme enthusiasm (""oh my god i love that!"") to questioning doubt (""really?"") to emphatic rejection (""no!"") is a classic sarcastic structure. this abrupt emotional rollercoaster within a single short statement is typical of sarcastic speech, where the initial positive reaction is quickly and dramatically undermined, revealing that the speaker's true feelings are the opposite of what was initially expressed. the exaggerated nature of the statement, coupled with the stark contrasts, strongly indicates sarcasm rather than genuine sentiment.",1.0
CHANDLER: No thanks Josephine!,"JOEY: Hey Chandler!, come on in we are knitting pot holders.

2. the cues mention that ""thanks"" might be used sarcastically in this context, given the exclamation point.
3. the name ""chandler"" could potentially refer to the character from the tv show ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic humor.
4. the brevity and abruptness of the response, coupled with the polite phrase ""thanks"" in a declining context, can be interpreted as a sarcastic dismissal.

while there isn't extensive context, the combination of these elements suggests a sarcastic tone rather than a genuinely polite refusal.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

3. he's implying that his bosses will eventually think he's an idiot anyway, but he doesn't want to speed up that process by making a bad recommendation.

4. this self-deprecating humor combined with a subtle jab at his bosses is very characteristic of chandler's sarcastic style in the show ""friends.""

the sarcasm lies in the unexpected turn of the statement, where he goes from a professional concern to a humorous, self-deprecating comment about his perceived competence in the eyes of his bosses.",1.0
