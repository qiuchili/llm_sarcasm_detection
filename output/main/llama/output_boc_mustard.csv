based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* cultural background: the text appears to be from a fantasy role-playing game setting, with references to ""quests"", ""level ten"", and a character named ""buttons"".
* keywords: ""think"", ""stop thinking"", ""quest"", ""game character""
* punctuation: the text contains periods (.) and question marks (?)
* special symbols: none
* emotional contrasts: the text contains a contrast between howard's enthusiastic tone and penny's more neutral/casual tone.

based on these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text.

the reason for this is that penny's response ""i don't think i'll be able to stop thinking about it"" is likely meant to be sarcastic, as howard's previous suggestion was to hang out and go on a quest, which seems like a mundane activity. penny's response is an exaggeration, implying that she will be unable to stop thinking about it, which is an unlikely scenario. the tone is also dry and understated, which is consistent with sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

**cue extraction:**

**language style:** formal, casual conversation between two characters.

**surface emotion:** penny's response appears to be neutral, without any apparent emotional tone.

**punctuation:** the response only contains periods, which is typical for a casual conversation.

**rhetorical devices:** none apparent.

**keywords:** ""stop thinking about it"", ""it"" (referring to the game character idea).

**analysis:** penny's response seems to be a straightforward, matter-of-fact reaction to howard's suggestion. the use of ""i don't think i'll be able to stop thinking about it"" is a literal interpretation of the idea, rather than a sarcastic one. there is no hint of irony, understatement, or mocking tone, which are common characteristics of sarcastic language.

**label:** **not sarcastic**",0,"assistant

here are the cues extracted from the input text:

**topic:** the topic is about penny's reaction to howard's suggestion to create a game character and hang out together.

**rhetorical devices:** none explicitly used in this short conversation.

**surface emotion:** penny's response seems neutral, indicating a lack of strong emotions.

**common knowledge:** none relevant to this conversation.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'not sarcastic'** to the input text. penny's response is straightforward and lacks any obvious sarcastic tone or language.",0,0

* **surface emotion:** none apparent, as the conversation is lighthearted and humorous.

* **special symbols:** none
* **topic:** refusal to accept sheldon's request to join the planetarium
* **rhetorical devices:** irony (sheldon is using a phrase ""i'm sorry, too"" to express a negative sentiment)
* **surface emotion:** frustration/disappointment

### label: 

**sarcastic**

the language style and tone of the response suggest that sheldon is being sarcastic. the phrase ""i'm sorry, too"" is an ironic expression of regret, implying that sheldon is not actually sorry, but rather frustrated with the situation.",1,"assistant

**cultural background:** the reference to ""wallet"" as a metaphor for emotional capacity is a common idiomatic expression in western culture, particularly in american english.

**common knowledge:** the concept of having limited emotional capacity or being unable to handle more emotional demands is a widely understood idea.

**rhetorical devices:** the use of irony (""well, i'm sorry, too"") and understatement (""there's just no room for you in my wallet"") are rhetorical devices that indicate sarcasm.

**language style:** the tone of the sentence is casual and conversational, which is typical of spoken language. the use of colloquial expressions (""too"") and the abrupt ending (""wallet"") also suggest a conversational tone.

**punctuation:** the lack of punctuation after ""wallet"" creates a sense of abruptness, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

the input text is sarcastic because it uses irony and understatement to convey a sense of annoyance or frustration, rather than genuine apology or sympathy.",1,"assistant

**common knowledge:** the context is a conversation between sheldon cooper and someone at the planetarium, and sheldon is known for his sarcastic personality.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the input text is apologetic (""i'm sorry, too""), but it's likely a facade.

**special symbols:** none.

**emotional words:** ""sorry"", ""too"" (although it's used to convey insincerity rather than genuine emotion).

**label:** **sarcastic**

sheldon's apologetic tone is likely a sarcastic way of saying that he's not interested in continuing to support the planetarium, and that he's prioritizing his own financial interests over his membership. the use of ""too"" to convey insincerity and the formal, polite language are also indicative of sarcasm.",1,1

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**language style:** the language used is informal, conversational, and slightly humorous. the tone is playful and lighthearted, with a hint of innuendo.

**common knowledge:** the conversation is about a specific situation where a couple has broken up, and the characters are discussing how to comfort the girl.

**topic:** the topic is about how to console a girl who has just gone through a breakup.

**emotional contrasts:** the text conveys a contrast between the emotional state of the girl (sadness and vulnerability) and the suggested approach to comforting her (playful and flirtatious).

**context:** the conversation is taking place among friends who are trying to offer advice on how to console a girl who has just gone through a breakup.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the text is sarcastic because it's using a playful and lighthearted tone to make a suggestion that is not entirely serious or respectful. the language used is informal and humorous, and the suggestion to ""cop a feel"" is likely meant to be ironic or tongue-in-cheek, rather than a genuine advice on how to comfort someone.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify it as follows:

**common knowledge:** none that stands out as particularly relevant to the classification of sarcasm.

**rhetorical devices:** the text contains a clear example of sarcasm, as howard's suggestion is clearly inappropriate and humorous. the use of ""cop a feel"" is a common idiomatic expression that is often used in a joking or ironic manner.

**cultural background:** the text appears to be set in a modern american context, with references to technology (e.g. blogs) and social norms (e.g. the idea of ""coping a feel"").

**context:** the conversation is taking place in a group of friends discussing a personal issue (penny's broken relationship), and the tone is informal and humorous.

**language style:** the text uses colloquial language and idiomatic expressions, which suggests a casual and informal tone.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* **common knowledge:** the context is a conversation between friends, and the topic is a broken item (a car) and a personal issue (a breakup).
* **keywords:** ""cop a feel"" is a phrase that can be interpreted as a euphemism for sexual harassment or assault.
* **cultural background:** the conversation is set in a contemporary american context, with references to ebay and a blog.
* **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""cop a feel"" is an idiomatic expression that is often used in a sarcastic or ironic tone.
* **language style:** the tone of the conversation is informal, with a hint of playfulness and sarcasm.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the phrase ""cop a feel"" is likely being used in a sarcastic or ironic tone, as it is an unusual and potentially inappropriate suggestion in the context of comforting someone who has just gone through a breakup. the tone of the conversation suggests that howard is not genuinely trying to offer helpful advice, but rather is being flippant or mocking.",1,1

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the text as follows:

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony: the statement ""pruny and bug-eyed"" is an ironic description of a fashion model, implying that the speaker does not find them attractive or desirable.
* hyperbole: the phrase ""i like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed"" is an exaggeration, as it is unlikely that anyone would actually prefer models with these physical characteristics.

**context:**

* the conversation is about mrs. giselle wolowitz's underwater photo shoot, which was embarrassing. this context suggests that the speaker is making a humorous comment about the models' appearance.

**punctuation:**

* the use of ""sadly"" at the beginning of the sentence is a hint that the speaker is being sarcastic, as it sets a tone that is opposite of what is actually being expressed.

**common knowledge:**

* the fact that chlorine can be harmful to some people, including mrs. giselle wolowitz, is common knowledge.

**special symbols:**

* none

**label:**

based on the cues extracted, i classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the use of irony, hyperbole, and sarcastic tone (indicated by the use of ""sadly"") suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic when they express their preference for ""pruny and bug-eyed"" fashion models.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i would classify the label as:

**sarcastic**

here's why:

* **language style**: the text uses a humorous and ironic tone, with a dash of exaggeration (""pruny and bug-eyed""), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.
* **punctuation**: the text does not contain any unusual or excessive punctuation, but the sentence structure and word choice convey a sense of irony and playfulness.
* **cultural background**: the text does not contain any specific cultural references that would suggest a particular cultural background.
* **emotional contrasts**: the text presents a contrast between the expected sentiment of sympathy for mrs. giselle wolowitz (due to her sensitivity to chlorine) and the speaker's apparent lack of concern or even amusement at the prospect of her being ""pruny and bug-eyed"".
* **special symbols**: none are used in the text.

overall, the text's tone, language, and emotional contrast suggest a sarcastic intent, which is consistent with the label ""sarcastic"".",1,"assistant

### response:

after analyzing the input text, i have extracted the following cues:

* **language style:** the language used is informal and conversational, with a touch of humor.
* **rhetorical devices:** the text uses irony (comparing pruny and bug-eyed to a desirable trait) and sarcasm (the speaker is being facetious about liking pruny and bug-eyed models).
* **context:** the conversation is about mrs. giselle wolowitz's underwater photo shoot, and the speaker is making a comment about her appearance.
* **emotional words:** the text contains words that convey a sense of irony and sarcasm, such as ""sadly"", ""lucky"", and ""pruny"" and ""bug-eyed"" (which are not typically desirable traits).
* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be playful and humorous, but with a hint of mocking tone.

### label:
sarcastic

the person's response is sarcastic because it implies that they did something unusual and unexpected, and then downplays the situation by saying they ""discreetly slipped off the other earring"" and ""got the hell out of there"". the tone is casual and matter-of-fact, which contrasts with the unusual and unexpected situation, suggesting that the person is being sarcastic.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

* emotional words: none explicitly present, but the tone of the response is playful and tongue-in-cheek.
* cultural background: none explicitly present, but the context of the conversation is likely a medical setting in the united states, given the mention of a post-op x-ray.

* rhetorical devices: the response uses a rhetorical question (""what do you think i did?"") to engage the listener and create a sense of anticipation, followed by a humorous and unexpected answer.

based on these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

**topic:** the topic appears to be a fictional murder trial, with the blunt instrument being the focus.

**punctuation:** the input text has a question mark at the end, which suggests a rhetorical question.

### label:
sarcastic",1,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the input text is one of surprise and possibly concern, as the person is describing a severe condition.

**common knowledge:** it is common knowledge that a severely inflamed larynx can be a serious medical condition.

**topic:** the topic of the conversation is sheldon's health, specifically his inflamed larynx.

**emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between the person's tone and the severity of the condition. the person's tone is more matter-of-fact and objective, whereas the condition is severe and potentially alarming.

**keywords:** the keywords that stand out are ""terribly inflamed"", ""never seen anything like it"", and ""right"", which suggest that the person is acknowledging sheldon's earlier claim about his condition.

**label:** based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the person's tone and language suggest that they are being ironic and tongue-in-cheek, rather than genuinely concerned or surprised.",1,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* **emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""oh no"" initially suggests a sense of alarm or surprise, but the subsequent statement ""you were right"" implies a sense of acceptance or agreement. this contrast in emotions is a common cue for sarcasm.
* **keywords:** ""terribly inflamed"" is an exaggeration, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.
* **language style:** the use of formal language (""your larynx is terribly inflamed"") and the objective tone (""i've never seen anything like it"") are unusual in everyday conversation, which may indicate sarcasm.
* **special symbols:** none
* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be concern or alarm, but the tone is likely ironic or mocking.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the input text is likely sarcastic because it starts with a sense of alarm, but the subsequent statement is actually a criticism or mockery of sheldon's inflamed larynx. the use of formal language and the exaggeration of the situation (""terribly inflamed"") further support the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1,1

* language style: the language style is informal and conversational, with a touch of humor and playfulness.

* context: the context is a conversation between friends or acquaintances, likely in a social or domestic setting, where they are discussing a woman's bathroom products.

### label:

based on the cues, i would assign the label: **not sarcastic**

the tone of raj's statement is more straightforward and literal, without any obvious intent to mock or mockingly express himself. the suggestion to build a bear is a humorous and lighthearted response, rather than a sarcastic one.",0,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the input text appears to be playful and lighthearted, as raj is suggesting a humorous and whimsical activity to distract from the previous conversation.

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge cue is that ""building a bear"" is a popular activity, especially for children, and is often associated with a fun and lighthearted experience.

**rhetorical devices:** there are no overt rhetorical devices in this input text, but the suggestion to ""build a bear"" is a form of verbal irony, as it's unlikely that building a bear would be a suitable response to the previous conversation.

**emotional words:** the emotional words present in the input text are ""let's"" and ""go"", which convey a sense of friendliness and willingness to compromise.

**punctuation:** the punctuation used in the input text is standard, with no notable deviations that would suggest sarcasm.

**special symbols:** none

**keywords:** ""bear"", ""build"", ""her""

**context:** the conversation is about a woman's bathroom products, and the previous speakers, howard and sheldon, were making humorous and sarcastic comments about them. raj's comment seems out of place, as he's suggesting doing something physical (building a bear) instead of continuing the conversation about bathroom products.

**punctuation:** the sentence is a simple statement without any unusual punctuation.

**emotional contrasts:** the previous speakers were making sarcastic and humorous comments, while raj's comment seems more straightforward and serious. this contrast in tone and emotional intensity could indicate that raj's comment is not sarcastic.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of:

**not sarcastic**

raj's comment seems like a genuine suggestion, rather than a sarcastic remark. the tone and language used are straightforward and don't contain any obvious sarcastic cues.",0,0

**emotional words:** none explicitly stated, but the tone of the response suggests a hint of annoyance or frustration.

**common knowledge:** none relevant to the conversation.

**cultural background:** none relevant to the conversation.

**keywords:** ""yoga"", ""showing me around"", ""university""

**rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""a lot of words sound like 'yoga'"" is an example of a rhetorical device called ""equivocation"", which is a figure of speech that involves using a word or phrase in a way that is different from its usual or expected meaning. this device is often used to make a point in a humorous or ironic way.

considering these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of the response suggests that leonard is being facetious and ironic, implying that penny is not telling the truth about having yoga classes at the university. the use of the rhetorical device ""equivocation"" reinforces this interpretation, as it is a common technique used in sarcasm to convey a meaning that is opposite of the literal interpretation.",0,"assistant

**sarcastic**

the tone and language used convey a sense of annoyance and frustration, and the use of irony and contrast creates a sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

* punctuation: the input text ends with a question mark (?), which is a common punctuation mark used in rhetorical questions, often indicating sarcasm.
* common knowledge: the phrase ""kind of makes you feel more alive"" is a common phrase used to express the idea that something is exciting or thrilling. however, the tone of the sentence is not consistent with this common knowledge, as it's unlikely someone would genuinely feel more alive by being a target for a paint pellet.
* cultural background: the context of the conversation is a humorous exchange between two characters, which suggests a lighthearted and playful tone. this cultural background is consistent with the use of sarcasm in everyday conversation.
* keywords: the phrase ""kind of makes you feel more alive"" is a key phrase that stands out as unusual in this context. the word ""alive"" is also a keyword, as it's an unexpected and ironic choice given the situation.
* emotional contrasts: the sentence expresses a sense of irony and contradiction, as being a target for a paint pellet is unlikely to make someone feel more alive. this emotional contrast suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their true feelings, which are likely the opposite of what they're saying.

### analysis:

the input text appears to be a genuine expression of sentiment, rather than a sarcastic comment. the emotional words used (""hardly a day goes by"") suggest a sense of longing or nostalgia, which is unlikely to be sarcastic. the context of the conversation also suggests that leonard is sharing a personal thought or feeling, rather than making a sarcastic remark.

### label:

based on the cues extracted from the input text, here's the classification:

**common knowledge:** the context of the conversation is about sheldon's grant proposal and his unusual visit to president seibert's house.

**topic:** the topic of the conversation is sheldon's grant proposal and his thoughts about it.

**cultural background:** the conversation takes place in a modern-day academic or research setting, with references to a grant proposal and a university setting.

**keywords:** ""hardly a day goes by"", ""think about it"", ""it"" (referring to the grant proposal).

**label:** based on the cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone of the sentence is somewhat ironic, implying that leonard is not actually thinking about the grant proposal every day, but rather is expressing frustration or disappointment about the situation. the use of ""hardly a day goes by"" is a common sarcastic phrase used to convey the opposite of what is literally meant.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i have extracted the following cues:

* emotional contrasts: none explicitly mentioned, but the phrase ""hardly a day goes by"" implies a sense of frequency or regularity, which could be contrasted with the expected response of ""i never think about it"".
* emotional words: ""think"" and ""about"" are neutral words, but the phrase ""hardly a day goes by"" has a slightly melancholic tone.
* cultural background: american, as the characters are likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory"".
* language style: conversational and informal, with a hint of introspection.
* rhetorical devices: none explicitly mentioned, but the phrase ""hardly a day goes by"" is a rhetorical device, as it's a common idiomatic expression used to convey a sense of frequency.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the phrase ""hardly a day goes by when i don't think about it"" has a slightly ironic tone, implying that leonard is thinking about something unpleasant or disturbing, which is not explicitly stated. the use of the rhetorical device and the conversational language style also suggest a sarcastic tone.",1,1

* punctuation: the dialogue is in a conversational format with no specific punctuation cues

**label:** 'sarcastic'

sheldon's response to leonard's concern about penny's feelings is a clear example of sarcasm, as he is being facetious and ironic. leonard's tone is also uncertain and hesitant, which contrasts with sheldon's sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i'll extract the following cues:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the tone of the input text is neutral, but the context suggests that leonard might be expressing concern or hesitation. sheldon's previous response was sarcastic, which could influence leonard's tone.
2. **language style**: the language used is simple and direct, which is consistent with a conversational tone. however, the phrase ""terrific, it's just that..."" could be interpreted as slightly ironic or hesitant.
3. **context**: the conversation is between two friends, sheldon and leonard, and they are discussing leonard's potential trip to the north pole. sheldon's previous response was sarcastic, which sets the tone for the conversation.
4. **surface emotion**: on the surface, leonard's statement seems to be expressing a genuine concern or hesitation about penny's feelings.
5. **common knowledge**: the audience is familiar with the characters' personalities and relationships, which helps to inform the interpretation of the conversation.

considering these cues, i would label the input text as:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the input text is subtle, but it could be interpreted as slightly ironic or hesitant, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone. the phrase ""terrific, it's just that..."" could be seen as a tongue-in-cheek way of expressing leonard's concern, and the context of the conversation suggests that leonard is responding to sheldon's sarcasm with a tone that is similarly lighthearted and playful.",0,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* **topic:** the topic is about leonard's reluctance to go to the north pole.
* **punctuation:** the input text contains a period (.) at the end, indicating a complete sentence.

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* rhetorical devices: the question ""what did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?"" is a rhetorical device, as it is unlikely that penny actually meant to say she was going to miss leonard. this is a common technique used in sarcasm to convey the opposite meaning.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the question is curiosity or concern, but this emotion is likely to be insincere.
* emotional contrasts: there is no obvious emotional contrast in this sentence, but the use of a question to express a sentiment that is likely to be sarcastic creates an emotional contrast between the expected emotional response (concern or curiosity) and the actual emotional response (sarcasm).
* cultural background: no specific cultural background is relevant to this sentence.
* punctuation: the punctuation in the sentence is standard and does not convey any sarcasm.

based on these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues:

**cultural background:** none relevant to this conversation.

**emotional words:** ""no"", ""always"", ""friends"" (neutral emotions, no strong emotions like anger, sadness, etc.)

the tone is conciliatory, and the phrase ""i mean"" is used to clarify penny's previous statement, which was likely misunderstood. the statement itself is a genuine offer to repair their friendship. there is no hint of irony, understatement, or mocking tone, which are common characteristics of sarcastic speech.

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**emotional words:** none

**emotional contrasts:** ""no"" implies a contrast to the initial expectation of getting chocolate

**context:** the conversation is about replacing someone at work, and sheldon is making a sarcastic comment about leonard's behavior. this context suggests that the response is likely sarcastic.

**punctuation:** the use of the question mark in the response (""no, i don't want any chocolate!"") is a common way to convey sarcasm in spoken language.

**special symbols:** none

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

**common knowledge**: none

**rhetorical devices**: irony (leonard is pretending to refuse chocolate, but it's actually a common way sheldon uses to bribe him)

**emotional words**: none

**keywords**: chocolate, sheldon, leonard

**emotional contrasts**: none

considering these cues, i assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the tone of the conversation suggests that leonard is being sarcastic by pretending to refuse chocolate, which is a common way sheldon uses to bribe him. the use of irony and the context of the conversation also support the classification of the text as sarcastic.",1,"assistant

* cultural background: american (based on the tv show ""the big bang theory"" which is set in the united states)

considering these cues, i label the input text as:

**sarcastic**

the phrase ""no, i don't want any chocolate!"" is likely a sarcastic response to sheldon's accusation, as leonard is denying the accusation but the tone and language used suggest a playful and ironic tone, rather than a genuine rejection of chocolate.",1,1

**context**: the conversation is about penny's conversation with someone, and sheldon's response is a reaction to it. the tone is playful and humorous.

**emotional contrasts**: the sentence is laced with emotional contrasts, such as the use of ""obviously"" to emphasize the opposite of what is meant, and the juxtaposition of ""complex socio-economic activity"" with the mundane task of waitressing.

### response:

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**topic:** relationship and dating

**rhetorical devices:** hyperbole (""build one""), irony (implying that howard is not capable of building a girlfriend)

**surface emotion:** anger or frustration (towards penny for dumping howard)

**punctuation:** none notable

**emotional words:** ""obviously"", ""way out of line"", ""new boyfriend"", ""new girlfriend"" (all conveying a sense of negativity)

based on these cues, i assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the text is sarcastic because howard is using hyperbole and irony to express his frustration and anger towards penny's behavior. the surface emotion is anger, but the language used is not straightforward and is meant to be humorous and mocking.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**emotional contrasts:** none explicitly stated, but there is a subtle contrast between howard's tone and the words he uses. he's being critical of penny, but his words are lighthearted and playful.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be frustration or annoyance towards penny's behavior.

**keywords:** ""dump"", ""new boyfriend"", ""new girlfriend"", ""build one"" - these words have a playful, tongue-in-cheek tone.

**rhetorical devices:** the text employs a form of sarcasm, specifically "" irony"" (saying the opposite of what you mean to convey). howard is not literally saying that penny will have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning or that leonard will build a girlfriend.

**language style:** the language is informal, conversational, and playful, which is typical of sarcastic speech.

based on these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,"assistant

* cultural background: the context is a conversation between friends, likely in a casual setting, which suggests a western cultural background.

### extraction of cues:

#### context:
the conversation is taking place in a setting where two people, howard and the person, are discussing a game and howard's social life.

#### cultural background:
the conversation appears to be set in a western cultural context, with references to popular culture (star wars, princess leia) and a mention of a woman's name (bernadette).

#### topic:
the topic of the conversation is howard's social life, specifically his relationships and his desire to play a game with the person.

#### special symbols:
none.

#### emotional contrasts:
the person's statement is a contrast to howard's previous suggestion to play a game, and the person's tone is sarcastic and playful. the mention of princess leia is an unexpected and humorous twist, and the phrase ""she's a wonderful girl and she really likes you"" is a clear attempt to deflect the person's sarcasm.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the person's statement is clearly sarcastic, with a tone that is playful and humorous, but also slightly mocking and ironic.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* language style: informal and playful (the use of ""make-believe"" and ""real woman"" suggests a lighthearted and humorous tone)

### label:
sarcastic

the input text is sarcastic because the speaker is pretending to be polite and friendly, but the words and tone are actually mocking and ironic. the speaker is being facetious when they say ""of course i mean bernadette"" and ""she's a wonderful girl and she really likes you"", as they are clearly trying to be sarcastic and humorous.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* special symbols: none
* surface emotion: sheldon's tone seems to be enthusiastic and playful, but there's a hint of sarcasm.
* emotional contrasts: the contrast between sheldon's love for beverages and his interest in serotonin suggests a tone that's not entirely genuine.
* cultural background: american, likely from a sitcom or tv show (the big bang theory).
* context: the conversation is between friends, and sheldon's tone is playful and slightly mocking.

### analysis:

the input text contains a hint of sarcasm, as sheldon's enthusiasm for serotonin and his goodbye seem to be an exaggeration. the tone is playful, but the language used is not entirely genuine, which suggests sarcasm.

### label:

sarcastic",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**emotional contrasts:** the text has a sudden shift from a seemingly innocent and enthusiastic tone to a dismissive and sarcastic tone. this contrast suggests sarcasm.

**punctuation:** the use of ""bye-bye"" at the end of the sentence is an informal and abrupt way to end the conversation, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.

**keywords:** the phrase ""if there's one thing i like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin"" is a clear exaggeration and a red flag for sarcasm.

**emotional words:** the use of ""i do so love"" at the beginning of the text is an over-the-top expression of enthusiasm, which is likely ironic. the word ""bye-bye"" also has a dismissive and abrupt tone, which is emotional in nature.

**language style:** the text has a playful and tongue-in-cheek tone, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of hyperbole (""if there's one thing i like more than..."") and the sudden change in tone also suggest sarcasm.

based on these cues, i assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the input text is sarcastic because it uses emotional contrasts, exaggerated language, and an abrupt tone to convey a message that is opposite of what it seems.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* common knowledge: walking after a meal can aid in digestion, and serotonin is a neurotransmitter that can be affected by walking.
* context: the conversation is between friends, and they are discussing sheldon's unusual behavior of taking an after-dinner walk.
* topic: the topic is sheldon's interest in taking an after-dinner walk and his justification for it.
* keywords: ""study online"", ""digestion"", ""serotonin"", ""refreshing beverage"", ""bye-bye"".
* punctuation: the text uses a question mark at the end of the sentence, which is an indicator of a sarcastic tone.

### label:

based on the cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of the text is sarcastic because sheldon is using a study as a justification for his unusual behavior, and the phrase ""if there's one thing i like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin"" is an exaggeration and a clear sign of sarcasm. the use of ""bye-bye"" at the end of the sentence also suggests that sheldon is ending the conversation abruptly, which is another indicator of sarcasm.",1,1

* rhetorical devices: the input text appears to be an example of a rhetorical question, as howard is not actually seeking an answer but rather expressing his skepticism or annoyance.

**topic:** the topic of the conversation is howard's observation of sheldon's behavior, specifically his walking up and down the stairs.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because the input text is a rhetorical question, implying that sheldon is being ridiculous or absurd by walking up and down the stairs. the tone is playful and humorous, but also slightly mocking, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

* **language style:** informal, conversational

**label:** **sarcastic**

the cue ""so what"" is often used sarcastically to express irony or frustration. the tone of the sentence is questioning, but the words used are not typical of a genuine question. the context of the conversation, where sheldon is being his usual eccentric self, also suggests that howard's tone is likely sarcastic.",1,1

### extraction of cues:

* special symbols: none

* punctuation: none
* topic: the topic is the offer of the bathroom and the speaker's response to it.

### classification:

the cues extracted suggest that the response is sarcastic. the use of the word ""thoughtful"" to describe the offer of the bathroom is ironic, as the speaker is not actually grateful or appreciative. the contrast between the expectation of gratitude and the speaker's actual intention to prioritize their coffee over the offered bathroom also implies sarcasm. therefore, the correct label is:

**sarcastic**",1,"assistant

* **emotional words:** ""fondest hope"", ""bitchin'"" (has a playful and enthusiastic tone)

### label:
based on the cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. although the tone is generally informative, the use of the colloquial expression ""bitchin'"" in a historical context and sheldon's character's tendency to use humor and irony suggest that the text is intended to be humorous and sarcastic.",1,"assistant

**cues extracted:**

* **language style:** sheldon's quote uses a formal, academic tone, while the person's dialogue uses informal, casual language.
* **surface emotion:** sheldon's quote appears to be serious and enthusiastic, while the person's dialogue seems playful and enthusiastic.
* **emotional contrasts:** sheldon's serious tone is contrasted with the person's casual tone, and sheldon's enthusiasm is contrasted with the person's playfulness.
* **rhetorical devices:** sheldon's quote uses a rhetorical device called ""irony"" by using the word ""bitchin'"" in a formal, academic context.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with a mix of formal and casual vocabulary. the use of slang words like ""bitchin'"" is noticeable.

**context:** the conversation is a continuation of a previous scene, where the characters are discussing a dirty sock. the current scene appears to be a sudden shift in topic, with sheldon talking about albert einstein and the laser.

**rhetorical devices:** sheldon's statement uses a rhetorical device called irony, where he attributes a casual, informal phrase (""bitchin'"") to a historical figure (albert einstein) in a formal scientific context. this is an unusual and unexpected combination, which may indicate sarcasm.

**special symbols:** the input text contains html symbols for italics (<i> and </i>), which are used to format the scientific paper title.

based on these cues, i assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the use of irony, the informal language, and the unexpected combination of formal and casual vocabulary suggest that sheldon's statement is likely sarcastic.",1,1

the tone of the input text is sarcastic because howard is making a humorous and unlikely explanation for penny's kiss, implying that it's not a genuine romantic gesture. the use of ""all the time"" in the phrase ""with me and my mom"" is also a hint at howard's sarcasm, as it's an exaggeration and not meant to be taken literally.",1,"assistant

* **emotional contrasts:** the text does not contain any explicit emotional contrasts, but the phrase ""keeper"" can be interpreted as a sarcastic remark, implying that the speaker is being ironic or mocking.
* **special symbols:** none
* **context:** the conversation is about ex-boyfriends, and the tone is somewhat lighthearted and playful. the speaker is addressing penny, and the phrase ""keeper"" is a common idiomatic expression.
* **common knowledge:** the concept of a ""keeper"" is a common expression in everyday language, and it's not specific to any particular domain or culture.
* **language style:** the language used is informal, and the tone is conversational.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the phrase ""well, i'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper"" can be interpreted as a sarcastic remark, implying that the speaker is being ironic or mocking. the use of the word ""keeper"" in this context is unexpected and playful, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i classify the label as:

**sarcastic**

here's why:

* special symbols: none
* cultural background: american (assuming the context is american culture)
* punctuation: the text is written in a conversational tone with no unusual punctuation marks.
* topic: the topic is a personal relationship (ex-boyfriend) and a comment about the speaker's new partner.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion is one of relief or approval, but it's likely being used ironically.

the phrase ""a keeper"" is often used to describe someone who is reliable and trustworthy, but in this context, it's likely being used sarcastically to imply that the new partner is boring or unexciting. the tone of the sentence suggests that the speaker is being facetious, and the label ""sarcastic"" is more fitting than ""not sarcastic"".",0,1

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the text as:

**sarcastic**

here are the cues that led me to this classification:

1. **rhetorical device**: the use of irony (""oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you"") and exaggeration (""rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver"") are common techniques used in sarcasm.
2. **punctuation**: the use of a question mark (""what do you want to talk about--"") instead of an exclamation mark or a period suggests a tone of irony or sarcasm.
3. **language style**: the language used is informal and playful, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.
4. **common knowledge**: the references to ""rocks, dinosaurs, and beavers"" are common topics of interest in a casual conversation, but the way they are presented suggests that the speaker is being facetious.
5. **surface emotion**: the tone of the text is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

overall, the cues suggest that the text is intended to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine inquiry about science topics.",1,"assistant

to classify the response as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

**special symbols:** none

**context:** the conversation is about a group of friends, including howard, penny, leonard, and person, who are discussing science and social relationships. the tone is informal and playful.

**cultural background:** the conversation is set in a contemporary american context, with references to common scientific topics (rocks, dinosaurs, beavers) and social relationships (dating).

**rhetorical devices:** the response contains irony, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm. howard's question ""what do you want to talk about-- rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?"" is an exaggeration and a clear example of irony, as person is unlikely to be genuinely interested in discussing these topics.

**common knowledge:** the conversation assumes a basic understanding of common scientific topics and social relationships, which is consistent with the cultural background.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",0,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* **topic:** science
* **punctuation:** none notable
* **special symbols:** none
* **emotional words:** none
* **rhetorical devices:**
	+ **irony:** ""friend the beaver"" (howard is being sarcastic by implying that beavers are not typically considered ""science"" topics)
	+ **sarcasm:** the entire sentence is laced with sarcasm, as howard is poking fun at the idea of discussing such mundane topics with the science group.

* special symbols: none
* context: the conversation is taking place between friends, and they're discussing a mutual acquaintance's dating history. the tone is lighthearted and playful.
* emotional contrasts: the speaker's tone is casual and nonchalant, but the words used (""stupid"", ""flip out"") suggest a hint of sarcasm.

	+ irony (sheldon's phrase ""up the ante"" is often used in a competitive or aggressive context, but in this case, it's likely being used sarcastically)
	+ double meaning (sheldon's phrase ""up the ante"" could be interpreted as an attempt to increase the stakes or offer a better deal, but it's also a common idiomatic expression used to describe increasing the intensity or stakes of a situation)
* **surface emotion:** curiosity or interest (sheldon is trying to persuade howard to abandon leonard and join him)
* **topic:** business or professional relationship

**label:** **sarcastic**

the use of irony and double meaning in sheldon's phrase ""up the ante"" suggests that he is being sarcastic, as he is likely not genuinely trying to persuade howard with a serious offer. the tone of the conversation also implies that sheldon is trying to manipulate howard, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,1

**cues:**

* punctuation: the use of a question mark (?) in the sentence ""where you going, the drive-thru at jack in the box?"" is a cue that the speaker is being sarcastic.
* emotional words: the word ""great"" in the previous conversation (""leonard: tonight? sure, that'd be great. okay, i'll see you then. bye."") is a positive emotional word, but in the context of sheldon's response, it's being used in a sarcastic tone.
* keywords: the phrase ""drive-thru at jack in the box"" is a keyword that implies a low-brow or unimpressive setting, which is being used to mock leonard's research.
* emotional contrasts: the contrast between leonard's enthusiasm for dinner and talk about research, and sheldon's skepticism and mocking tone, is a cue that sheldon's response is sarcastic.
* rhetorical devices: the use of a rhetorical question (""where you going, the drive-thru at jack in the box?"") is a device that implies sheldon doesn't really care about leonard's research, and is being used to express his disdain.

**cues:**

* **keywords:** ""drive-thru"", ""jack in the box"" (these words are likely used to convey a negative tone and to make a humorous comparison)
* **rhetorical devices:** irony (comparing sheldon's friend's dinner plans to a fast food drive-thru, implying that the dinner is not a significant or meaningful event)
* **context:** the conversation is about sheldon's friend's dinner plans, and sheldon is responding to leonard's invitation to dinner
* **emotional words:** none explicitly, but the tone is likely playful and humorous
* **emotional contrasts:** none explicitly, but the contrast between the expected dinner conversation and the comparison to a fast food drive-thru implies a sense of absurdity or mockery

* rhetorical devices: the phrase ""a bit heavy-handed"" is a rhetorical device used to convey a sense of irony or criticism
* emotional words: ""heavy-handed"" has a negative connotation, implying a sense of emotional weight or excess

### label: sarcastic",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

**keywords:** heavy-handed, snowflake

**context:** the conversation is about a snowflake that leonard gave to penny, and bernadette's romantic reaction to it. amy is now commenting on the situation.

**emotional words:** romantic, heavy-handed (has a slightly negative connotation)

**rhetorical devices:** none apparent

**cultural background:** none apparent

### analysis:

amy's statement is likely sarcastic because she is criticizing the romantic gesture of holding a snowflake, implying that it's too cheesy or over-the-top. the use of the phrase ""a bit heavy-handed"" is a common idiomatic expression that can be used to convey sarcasm. additionally, the context of the conversation suggests that amy is not being serious, as she is commenting on a romantic gesture that bernadette has just praised.

### label: sarcastic",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

**language style:** the language used is formal and conversational, with a hint of irony and subtlety.

**topic:** the topic is a snowflake and its significance, specifically the idea of leonard giving it to penny.

**punctuation:** the punctuation used is standard, with no unusual or excessive use of punctuation marks.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed is curiosity and mild skepticism.

**emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between the initial tone of the statement (neutral) and the implied meaning (sarcasm), as well as the contrast between the seriousness of the topic (a snowflake) and the lighthearted tone of the conversation.

based on these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the sarcastic tone is evident in the phrase ""a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?"", which implies that the speaker finds the situation or leonard's gesture to be overly sentimental or cheesy. the use of irony and subtlety in the language also suggests a sarcastic tone.",1,1

based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the input text is likely sarcastic because it's an unexpected and humorous statement. the tone is playful and lighthearted, and the surprise value is high. the use of a loom and weaving as a hobby is unusual and might be used to poke fun at sheldon's new interest. the sarcastic tone is likely intended to be humorous and playful, rather than serious or genuine.",1,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the input text appears to be neutral, as it is a request for medication and a specific product.

**punctuation:** the punctuation in the input text is standard, with no unusual or attention-grabbing punctuation that would suggest sarcasm.

**label:** based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of **'not sarcastic'** to the input text, as the tone appears to be neutral and the language is straightforward. however, the context of the conversation suggests that sheldon's tone may be humorous or ironic, which could be interpreted as sarcasm.",0,"assistant

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i'll extract the following cues:

**language style:** the language style is formal, with sheldon using technical medical terms like ""penicillin"" and ""syrup of ipecac"".

considering these cues, i believe the input text is likely **sarcastic**. the language style and keywords suggest that sheldon is being serious about his medical needs, but the context and previous conversation suggest that he may be using sarcasm to make a point or be humorous. the emotional words are absent, but the tone is formal and technical, which is unusual for a normal conversation. therefore, i classify the input text as **sarcastic**.",0,"assistant

**surface emotion:** irritation/sarcastic tone (sheldon's response is likely a sarcastic remark)

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* common knowledge: the conversation is between two characters, amy and sheldon, who are likely from a tv show or movie, given the context of the conversation.
* rhetorical devices:
	+ irony: sheldon's statement ""what a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload"" is ironic because he is referring to his own neck, which is fragile, but also capable of supporting his head and brain.
	+ hyperbole: sheldon's comparison of his neck to balancing a faberge egg on a pixie stick is an exaggeration, making it a hyperbole.
* cultural background: the conversation is likely from a tv show or movie, which is a product of western culture.
* special symbols: none
* punctuation: the conversation is well-punctuated, with proper use of commas, periods, and quotation marks.

based on these cues, i assign a label of:

**sarcastic**

sheldon's response is sarcastic because he is being ironic and hyperbolic, and his tone is likely mocking and dismissive. the phrase ""i'd like to respond to that sarcastically"" is also a hint that sheldon is aware of the sarcasm and is choosing to respond in kind.",1,1

i'll extract the cues from the input text to classify it as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'.

**common knowledge:** none that stands out.

**surface emotion:** the tone of the text is lighthearted and playful.

**special symbols:** none.

**punctuation:** the text uses standard punctuation marks such as commas, periods, and quotation marks.

**cultural background:** the text appears to be from a western cultural context, possibly from a tv show or movie.

now, let's analyze the text:

the text is a humorous exchange between two characters, sheldon and leonard. sheldon is giving leonard a sarcastic welcome, making fun of his friend's ""coolness"" by not wearing a lapel pin. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, indicating sarcasm.

**label:** 'sarcastic'",0,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**emotional words:**

* none

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony (the phrase ""too cool to wear"" implies that leonard is being pretentious or trying too hard, which is ironic given the situation)

**special symbols:**

* none

**punctuation:**

* periods (.) at the end of sentences

**emotional contrasts:**

* the phrase ""congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard"" suggests a positive tone, while the addition of ""which leonard was too cool to wear"" implies a slightly negative or mocking tone

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the use of irony and a slightly negative tone in the phrase ""too cool to wear"" suggests that sheldon is being sarcastic, rather than genuinely congratulatory.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

**language style:**
the language used is informal, conversational, and humorous, with a touch of irony.

**emotional words:**
there are no explicit emotional words in the input text, but the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek.

**context:**
the context is a conversation between friends, likely in a social setting, possibly a workplace or a social gathering.

**cultural background:**
the cultural background appears to be western, likely american, given the setting and the characters' personalities.

let's extract the cues:

**punctuation:** exclamation mark (!) at the end, indicating strong emotions or emphasis.

**context:** the conversation is about raj's romantic interests, and bernadette's previous behavior towards him. raj has just confessed his feelings, and bernadette is responding with a seemingly positive tone.

**cultural background:** american, likely influenced by popular culture and colloquial expressions.

**common knowledge:** the conversation is taking place in a social setting, likely a group of friends, and bernadette is known for her sassy and sarcastic personality.

considering these cues, i'd say...

**label:** **sarcastic**

why? because bernadette's response is overly enthusiastic and overly flattering, which is unusual for her character. the use of ""cutie pie"" and ""any girl would be lucky to have you"" is a bit too sugary and insincere, suggesting that bernadette is being sarcastic and teasing raj.",1,"### extraction of cues:

* emotional words: ""cutie pie"", ""lucky""
* language style: the tone is overly positive and flattering, which is unusual in a conversation about someone's romantic prospects. this suggests that bernadette may be being sarcastic.
* punctuation: the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence adds to the sense of irony and suggests that bernadette may not mean what she is saying.
* surface emotion: bernadette's words convey a sense of friendliness and positivity, but the context suggests that she may be being insincere.
* cultural background: the conversation is set in a modern american tv show, so the cultural background is likely to be western.

### assignment of label:

based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. bernadette's words are overly flattering and the tone is ironic, suggesting that she may not mean what she is saying.",1,"### context:
the context is a conversation between bernadette and raj, where raj has just confessed his feelings to bernadette, who has rejected him. raj is now seeking advice on whether he has a chance with penny.

### input:
bernadette: of course you do. you're a cutie pie! any girl would be lucky to have you!

### cues:

* **punctuation:** the use of an exclamation mark (!) at the end of the sentence suggests that bernadette is being enthusiastic and sincere.
* **common knowledge:** it's common knowledge that people generally like to be told they're attractive and likable.
* **emotional contrasts:** there is no apparent emotional contrast in this sentence, as bernadette's tone is consistently positive and encouraging.

sheldon: you just got off the list. would you like back on it? this'll just take a moment. it's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.

### label: sarcastic

the response is sarcastic because sheldon is trying to make penny feel uneasy and uncomfortable by offering to put her back on the list, despite her initial reluctance. the use of a serious tone and a mundane detail like the floppy disk adds to the sarcasm.",1,1

**language style:** the language used is formal and conversational, with a touch of irony.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be one of criticism and accusation.

**punctuation:** there is no punctuation in the input text that stands out as particularly sarcastic or ironic.

**topic:** the topic is the theme of betrayal and self-awareness.

**emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between the surface emotion of criticism and the underlying tone of irony and sarcasm.

considering these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the label as follows:

**rhetorical devices:**

* the statement ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself"" is a rhetorical device that uses irony and self-reference to make a point. it is a clever and indirect way of saying that howard is guilty of the same behavior he is accusing others of.

**keywords:**

* ""betrayal"" is a key word that is used to describe howard's actions, which is a common theme in sarcastic language.

**special symbols:**

* none

**context:**

* the conversation is about howard's past behavior, and sheldon's statement is a response to howard's accusations. this context suggests that sheldon is not just making a random statement, but is using it to make a point about howard's behavior.

**emotional contrasts:**

* sheldon's statement is a contrast to howard's emotional tone, which is likely to be upset or defensive. sheldon's statement is calm and matter-of-fact, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

based on these cues, i would classify the label as:

**sarcastic**

sheldon's statement is a clear example of sarcasm, as it uses irony and self-reference to make a point about howard's behavior. the tone is calm and matter-of-fact, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* common knowledge: none
* emotional words: betrayal
* cultural background: none
* topic: none (the topic is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a conversation about personal relationships and betrayal)

### analysis:

the input text ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself."" is a statement that implies a sense of irony or hypocrisy. the speaker, sheldon, is pointing out that howard (the previous speaker) is quick to accuse others of betrayal, but is unwilling to recognize his own betrayal. this implies that sheldon is criticizing howard's behavior, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.

**language style:**
the language style used is formal, with a hint of condescension and a touch of irony. the use of the phrase ""frankly, mom"" is a common way to express a slightly sarcastic tone.

**punctuation:**
there is no unusual or exaggerated punctuation that would suggest sarcasm. however, the use of the dash after ""frankly"" is a minor hint at a slightly sarcastic tone.

**rhetorical devices:**
the phrase ""without fear of falling off the edge"" is a rhetorical device that creates a sense of irony. it implies that the person's group is taking a big risk, but in a way that is unexpected and humorous.

**common knowledge:**
there is no specific common knowledge used in this sentence that would suggest sarcasm.

**emotional contrasts:**
the sentence expresses a contrast between the expected and the actual. the person is encouraged to see the group's progress, but the comment about sailing into the ocean without fear is unexpected and slightly ironic.

**label:**
based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone is slightly condescending, and the use of irony and unexpected language creates a sense of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* rhetorical devices: none
* emotional words: ""encouraged"", ""fear""
* language style: formal, sarcastic tone
* topic: the person's group activity (the all-you-can-eat last supper buffet and gunning with god)
* surface emotion: apparently positive (sheldon says he's ""encouraged"")

given these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the sarcastic tone is evident in the phrase ""i'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become"", which is likely meant to be ironic, given the absurdity of the activities mentioned (e.g. ""gunning with god""). the formal language and positive-sounding emotional words (""encouraged"") are likely used to mask the sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

**language style:** the language used is formal and polite, with a hint of condescension. the phrase ""frankly, mom"" is a way of softening the tone, but the sentence structure and vocabulary suggest a level of sophistication.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be one of encouragement and approval. the phrase ""i'm encouraged"" suggests a positive sentiment.

**punctuation:** the punctuation is standard, with no obvious deviations or irregularities.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely western, given the reference to a ""mom"" and the use of formal language.

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge is that a ""group"" is a common term for a social gathering or organization, and that ""sailing out into the ocean"" is a metaphorical expression for taking risks or venturing into the unknown.

considering these cues, i assign a label of **not sarcastic** to the input text. the tone is polite and encouraging, and the language is formal and sophisticated. there is no obvious irony, understatement, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm.",0,1

### extracted cues:

* keywords: ""heavens"", ""trip""
* topic: travel/adventure

* punctuation: the use of an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence (""oh, my word, a trip to the heavens."") adds to the emotional contrast and emphasizes the speaker's enthusiasm.
* language style: the use of an idiomatic expression (""oh, my word"") and the enthusiastic tone suggest a casual and conversational language style.

### label:
based on the extracted cues, i would classify the input text as 'not sarcastic'. the speaker's language and tone convey genuine excitement and enthusiasm, rather than irony or mocking tone, which are characteristic of sarcastic language.",0,0

**cultural background:** american, likely from a tv show or movie (the big bang theory)

**emotional contrasts:** the text contains a contrast between the calm and serious tone of sheldon's statement (""yes, there's nothing quite like..."") and the humorous and playful tone of the subsequent phrase (""the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled""), which suggests a sarcastic tone.

**language style:** the language is formal and somewhat dry, which is characteristic of sheldon's character in the big bang theory.

**punctuation:** the text contains a period (.) at the end of the sentence, which is a typical punctuation mark for a declarative sentence.

**keywords:** ""mildly startled"", ""slightly widened eyes"", which are humorous and ironic phrases that suggest sarcasm.

* **punctuation:** periods (.) at the end of each sentence

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of the sentence suggests that sheldon is being sarcastic when describing his reaction. the use of the phrase ""mildly startled"" to describe his reaction implies that he's not actually startled, but rather making light of the situation. the overall tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is consistent with sarcastic speech.",1,"assistant

**cultural background:** american (assuming the characters are from the tv show ""the big bang theory"")

**punctuation:** periods (.) at the end of sentences

**context:** the conversation is between two friends, leonard and sheldon, in a late-night setting. leonard is likely being playful and teasing sheldon about his interest in the nobel prize acceptance ceremony.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of the response is sarcastic because leonard is using a neutral tone and making a humorous comment about the scientists' attire, implying that he doesn't think sheldon is interested in the ceremony for any meaningful reason.",1,"assistant

**cues:**

* **keywords:** ""nobel prize"", ""scientists"", ""wearing""
* **emotional words:** none
* **context:** the conversation is about a nobel prize acceptance ceremony, and sheldon is watching it live. leonard is responding to sheldon's statement about watching the ceremony.
* **rhetorical devices:** irony (leonard is being sarcastic, implying that the scientists' outfits are not the most interesting aspect of the ceremony)
* **cultural background:** the conversation is set in a fictional tv show, ""the big bang theory"", which is a comedy series that often features nerdy and scientific references.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of leonard's response is clearly sarcastic, as he's implying that the scientists' outfits are not the most exciting or important aspect of the ceremony. the use of irony and the dry tone of the response are typical characteristics of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**keywords:** ""nobel prize"", ""scientists"", ""ceremony"", ""stockholm"", ""acceptance""

**common knowledge:** none that stands out as particularly relevant.

**language style:** amy's language style is informal and conversational, using colloquial expressions like ""screw her"" and ""hang out with us"".

**rhetorical devices:** amy uses a rhetorical device called an idiom, ""screw her"", which is an informal way of saying ""forget about her"" or ""don't care about her"".

**context:** the context is a conversation between amy and penny, and amy is expressing her opinion about bernadette. the conversation is informal and casual, and amy's tone is slightly sarcastic.

**punctuation:** the punctuation is normal, with proper use of commas, periods, and exclamation marks.

**label:** given the cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. amy's use of the idiom ""screw her"" and her tone of voice suggest that she is being sarcastic and expressing a negative opinion about bernadette.",1,"assistant

* **cultural background:** american (reference to ""hill folk"" and ""gunny sacks"" suggests a rural or southern american cultural background)
* **context:** sheldon is rejecting penny's offer to cut his hair, and is making fun of her suggestion
* **topic:** hair cutting
* **keywords:** ""bad boy attitude"", ""bottle-blonde"", ""hill folk""

**label:** **sarcastic**

sheldon's response is sarcastic because he is using irony to criticize penny's offer, and the tone is playful and mocking.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

**language style:**

* the language used is formal, with a hint of condescension and playfulness.
* sheldon's tone is mocking, as evident from the use of phrases like ""bottle-blonde"" and ""hill folk"".
* the sentence structure is complex, with a mix of short and long sentences.

**cultural background:**

* sheldon's reference to ""town"" and ""hill folk"" suggests a rural vs. urban contrast, which is a common cultural trope in american culture.

**emotional words:**

* none explicitly mentioned, but the tone is playful and slightly mocking.

**keywords:**

* ""bad boy attitude"", ""hair"", ""bottle-blonde"", ""hill folk""

**emotional contrasts:**

### cues extraction:

**common knowledge:** the conversation is between two people, raj and person, and they are reminiscing about good times they had together.

**language style:** the language used is casual and conversational, with a hint of awkwardness and informality.

**special symbols:** none.

**keywords:** ""good times"", ""camping"", ""secrets"", ""pedicures"", ""virginity"", ""cousin"".

**topic:** the topic of the conversation is about a shared experience between raj and person, specifically about a camping trip where they shared secrets with each other.

### classification:

based on the cues extracted, i would classify the input text as:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the conversation is lighthearted and playful, but the content of the conversation is slightly awkward and humorous, suggesting that raj is being sarcastic. the use of words like ""addicted to pedicures"" and ""lost his virginity to his cousin"" is an exaggeration and an unusual topic to discuss, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be sentimental and nostalgic, as raj is reminiscing about good times with someone.

**rhetorical devices:** the use of rhetorical questions (""like, uh"") and a pause (""i think back..."") creates a sense of informality and casualness, which is typical of everyday conversations.

**emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between the sentimental tone and the unexpected, humorous anecdotes raj shares, which suggests that the speaker is trying to be playful and lighthearted.

**cultural background:** the conversation seems to be set in a western cultural context, possibly in the united states, given the reference to pedicures and the casual tone.

**language style:** the language used is informal, conversational, and slightly awkward, which is typical of everyday conversations between friends.

**label:** based on these cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the use of humor and unexpected anecdotes, combined with the informal language and tone, suggests that raj is being sarcastic, possibly poking fun at the idea of a romantic relationship. the person's response, ""yeah, nice speech, francine,"" also implies that the speaker is being sarcastic.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

* **punctuation:** the text contains a mix of punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and dashes. however, the use of commas and dashes is not unusual in this context, and it's not a strong indicator of sarcasm.
* **keywords:** the keywords ""good times"", ""secrets"", ""pedicures"", and ""lost his virginity"" are neutral and don't necessarily convey sarcasm.
* **context:** the conversation appears to be a humorous and lighthearted exchange between friends, which suggests that the tone might be playful or ironic.
* **language style:** the language used is casual and conversational, with a touch of self-deprecation (e.g., ""i'm addicted to pedicures""). this style is not uncommon in everyday conversations and doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.
* **special symbols:** there are no special symbols in this text that would indicate sarcasm.

considering these cues, i'm going to assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone of the conversation is playful and humorous, and the language used is lighthearted and ironic. the fact that raj shares seemingly embarrassing secrets and makes a joke about his cousin is a strong indication of sarcasm.",1,1

**cues extraction:**

* **punctuation:** the text contains a mix of punctuation marks, including periods (.), commas (,), and question marks (?). there are no exclamation marks (!) or ellipses (...) that are commonly used in sarcastic language.
* **emotional contrasts:** the text contains a subtle contrast between howard's tone and bernadette's response. howard's question ""how about you? did you have a fun night?"" seems genuine, while bernadette's response is brief and lacks enthusiasm, which might be interpreted as a subtle hint of sarcasm.
* **topic:** the topic is about howard's night out with friends, which is a relatively neutral topic.

let's extract the cues to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic':

**punctuation:** the input text contains parentheses `()` to indicate walkie-talkie static, which is a playful and whimsical touch. this doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.

**context:** the conversation is taking place in a tv show, ""the big bang theory"", which is a comedy series. the characters are known for their geeky and humorous interactions. this context suggests that sarcasm might be present.

**cultural background:** the show is an american sitcom, and the characters' dialogue is likely influenced by american humor and cultural norms. sarcasm is a common aspect of american humor, so this cue leans towards the possibility of sarcasm.

**common knowledge:** the audience is likely familiar with the concept of walkie-talkies and their typical usage. sheldon's comment about the man in space might be a humorous exaggeration, which could be interpreted as sarcastic.

**emotional contrasts:** the input text presents a contrast between the seriousness of communicating with someone in space and the mundane nature of a coffee shop (coffee bean). this contrast could be an attempt to poke fun at the idea of space travel or the character's pretentiousness.

considering these cues, i would label the input text as:

**sarcastic**

the comment ""if you don't have the (walkie-talkie static) then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street"" is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, implying that the man in space is not as impressive as sheldon is making him out to be. the use of a mundane location like a coffee shop to compare to space travel is a classic sarcastic move, and the character's deadpan delivery adds to the comedic effect.",0,"**cues extraction:**

1. **emotional contrasts:** the statement ""if you don't have the (walkie-talkie static) then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street"" implies a contrast between the serious and formal tone of talking to someone in space and the mundane and casual atmosphere of a coffee shop.
2. **punctuation:** the use of a comma after ""space"" and the absence of a period after ""lake street"" creates a sense of flow and connection between the two clauses, which is characteristic of sarcastic speech.
3. **keywords:** the phrase ""might as well be"" is a common sarcastic expression, implying that something is not as impressive or extraordinary as it's being made out to be.
4. **cultural background:** the reference to a specific location like ""lake street"" and ""coffee bean"" is a nod to the cultural background of the characters, which is set in pasadena, california.
5. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the statement appears to be frustration or annoyance, as sheldon is expressing his disappointment that the walkie-talkie is not working properly.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the cues extracted suggest that sheldon's statement is sarcastic, as it uses emotional contrasts, punctuation, and keywords typical of sarcastic speech to express his frustration and disappointment.",1,1

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**keywords:** ""dog"", ""takes"", ""good thing""

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the sentence is contrasting the idea that a dog's presence would be a bad thing with the idea that a person's (penny's) presence was a bad thing, implying that penny's situation is worse.

**language style:** the sentence is direct, concise, and uses a common idiomatic expression (""it's a good thing..."").

**common knowledge:** the concept of a dog being a responsibility and potentially a burden is common knowledge.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the sentence is sarcastic because it's implying that penny's situation is so bad that even having a dog would be a better alternative, which is an exaggerated and ironic statement. the tone is critical and mocking, suggesting that amy is not genuinely concerned about penny's well-being, but rather is making a snide comment.",1,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* **topic:** the conversation is about penny's situation with a guy, specifically about her sleeping with him.
* **rhetorical devices:** irony (the phrase ""it's a good thing you don't have a dog"" is ironic because it's not related to the situation and is meant to be humorous)
* **special symbols:** none
* **emotional words:** ""sad"", ""good""
* **cultural background:** american (based on the tv show ""how i met your mother"" which is set in the us)

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of the conversation is informal and humorous, and the phrase ""it's a good thing you don't have a dog"" is meant to be sarcastic, implying that penny's situation is not a good thing at all. the use of irony and the lighthearted tone of the conversation also suggest that the input text is sarcastic.",1,"assistant

here are the cues extracted from the input text:

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be playful or teasing, as amy is making a lighthearted comment about penny's situation.

**keywords:** ""if that's all it takes"", ""it's a good thing"", ""don't have a dog"" - these keywords suggest that amy is poking fun at the idea that penny was swayed by someone's sad eyes.

**context:** the conversation is about penny's situation with someone, and amy is responding to penny's earlier statement about not knowing what else to do when faced with someone's sad eyes.

**language style:** the language used is informal, conversational, and playful, with a hint of sarcasm.

**topic:** the topic is penny's situation and amy's reaction to it.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,1

### context:
the conversation is about penny's relationship with dr. hofstadter and her involvement in a five-year experiment. the tone is casual and humorous, with a touch of irony.

### surface emotion:
the surface emotion expressed by penny is likely playful or flirtatious, as she makes a suggestive comment about taking someone's pants off.

### special symbols:
none.

### emotional words:
* ""want"" (implies a strong desire or attraction)

### rhetorical devices:
* double meaning: penny's comment can be interpreted as both a literal and figurative suggestion, making it a clever and playful use of language.

### label:
**sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because penny's comment is likely intended to be humorous and playful, rather than a genuine sexual advance. the use of a double meaning and the casual tone of the conversation suggest that penny is being sarcastic or ironic, rather than serious.",1,"assistant

### cues extracted:

* punctuation: the input text only contains a single sentence, so there is no punctuation to extract.
* emotional words: ""off"" can be interpreted as a euphemism for a sexual act, implying a strong emotional tone.
* language style: the sentence is direct and blunt, with no apparent attempt to sugarcoat or soften the statement. this suggests a bold and possibly provocative tone.
* keywords: ""limbic system"", ""pants off"" - the use of technical jargon (""limbic system"") and a suggestive phrase (""take your pants off"") implies a playful or flirtatious tone.
* rhetorical devices: the sentence is an example of a double entendre, using a scientific term to make a suggestive statement.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the sentence is likely intended to be humorous or playful, and the use of a scientific term to make a suggestive statement is a classic example of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic', i'll extract the following cues:

**cultural background:** the conversation is set in a modern-day, urban environment, with characters from the tv show ""the big bang theory"". this doesn't provide any specific cultural background cues that would suggest sarcasm.

**common knowledge:** the phrase ""my limbic system wants to take your pants off"" is a humorous and unexpected statement that might not be common knowledge. however, it's not entirely unknown either. the limbic system is a real part of the brain, and the phrase is a playful way to express a desire.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with a touch of playfulness and flirtation. this suggests a lighthearted and humorous tone, which could be indicative of sarcasm.

**emotional words:** the phrase contains words like ""wants"" and ""take"", which convey a sense of desire or intention. however, the tone is playful and not overtly emotional, which might not be typical of sarcastic language.

considering these cues, i would assign the label **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the phrase is likely intended to be humorous and playful, rather than a genuine expression of desire. the tone is lighthearted and flirtatious, which is consistent with the language style of the show.",0,1

* **emotional contrasts:** the conversation is lighthearted and playful, with a touch of irony and sarcasm.
* **emotional words:** ""under the weather"", ""under my dentist"" (used in a humorous way)
* **special symbols:** none

### analysis:

the input text is a humorous remark made by howard about his mother's dental issues and his friend bernadette's health. the use of the phrase ""under my dentist"" is an obvious exaggeration and sarcasm, implying that howard's mother is somehow under his control or influence. the tone is playful and lighthearted, but the use of sarcasm is clear.

**cultural background:** american ( references to dmv, license, and dentist)

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony: howard's comment ""my mom's kind of under my dentist"" is an example of irony, as it's unlikely that a parent would be under the care of their child's dentist.
* wordplay: the phrase ""under the weather"" is an idiomatic expression meaning feeling unwell, and howard's addition of ""under my dentist"" is a play on words.

**special symbols:** none

**topic:** howard's family members (bernadette and his mom) and their health

**emotional words:** none

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of howard's comment is clearly sarcastic, as he's using irony and wordplay to express his frustration or annoyance about his family members' health issues. the use of these rhetorical devices and the lack of emotional words suggest that howard is being sarcastic rather than genuinely concerned about his family's well-being.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* rhetorical devices: the use of understatement and irony in ""bernadette's a little under the weather"" (bernadette is likely not just a little under the weather, but seriously ill) and ""my mom's kind of under my dentist"" (the phrase ""under my dentist"" is a humorous way of saying that howard's mom is going to the dentist, but it's also a clever play on words).
* surface emotion: the tone of the statement appears to be lighthearted and playful, with a hint of sarcasm.
* keywords: ""under the weather"", ""under my dentist"" (these phrases suggest that howard is being facetious).
* context: the conversation is taking place between friends howard and raj, and they are discussing bernadette's health and howard's mom's dentist appointment. the context is casual and informal.
* emotional words: ""under the weather"", ""under my dentist"" (these phrases have a tone of playfulness and sarcasm).

**surface emotion:** howard's comment seems to be lighthearted and playful, which could be a mask for sarcasm.

### response:

i'm going to extract the cues from the input text to assign a correct label:

**special symbols:** none

**cultural background:** american (based on the reference to raiders of the lost ark)

**common knowledge:** the movie raiders of the lost ark is a well-known classic, and the concept of ""losing one's virginity"" is a common idiomatic expression.

**keywords:** ""entertaining"", ""glaring story problem""

**punctuation:** period (.) at the end of the sentence

based on these cues, i would assign a label of:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the sentence is tongue-in-cheek, and the phrase ""despite the glaring story problem"" implies that the speaker, amy, is being facetious and playful in their criticism.",1,"assistant

### cues extraction:

* emotional contrasts: the speaker, amy, expresses a positive sentiment (""it was very entertaining"") but also mentions a ""glaring story problem"", which creates an emotional contrast between the two statements.
* keywords: ""glaring story problem"" is a keyword that suggests a critical or negative opinion, which is unusual in a sentence that starts with a positive statement.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is a mix of positivity and criticism, which is a common pattern in sarcastic language.
* special symbols: none.
* cultural background: the conversation is set in a familiar, everyday context, without any specific cultural references or nuances that would suggest a particular cultural background.

based on the input text ""it was very entertaining... despite the glaring story problem."", i extract the following cues:

* emotional contrasts: the phrase ""despite"" implies a contrast between the positive emotion (""very entertaining"") and a negative emotion (the ""glaring story problem"").
* special symbols: the ellipsis (...) is used to indicate a pause or a break in thought, which can be a characteristic of sarcastic language.
* punctuation: the use of the comma after ""entertaining"" and the ellipsis after ""despite"" creates a sense of pause or hesitation, which can be a feature of sarcastic language.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is one of mild criticism or disappointment, which could be interpreted as sarcastic.
* language style: the language used is formal and polite, but the tone is critical and slightly negative, which could be a characteristic of sarcastic language.

let's extract the cues to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

**common knowledge:** the context is a conversation between friends, specifically sheldon and leonard from the tv show ""the big bang theory"". the topic is about an ugly sweater and a car.

**rhetorical devices:** the input text contains a rhetorical question (""why? because i got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car?""), which is a common device used in sarcastic speech.

**context:** the conversation is lighthearted and playful, with sheldon and penny poking fun at leonard's situation. the tone is informal and humorous.

**punctuation:** the input text uses a question mark (?) at the end of the rhetorical question, which is a common punctuation mark used in sarcastic speech.

**special symbols:** none.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**, as it contains a rhetorical question, a playful tone, and a lighthearted context, which are all characteristic of sarcastic speech.",0,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* surface emotion: the surface emotion appears to be a mix of frustration and defensiveness, as leonard is responding to sheldon's previous comment about his aunt making him an ugly sweater.
* context: the context is a conversation between friends, specifically leonard and sheldon, with penny joining in.
* topic: the topic is leonard's aunt making him an ugly sweater for college.
* punctuation: the punctuation used is mostly standard, with no unusual or sarcastic punctuation marks.
* cultural background: the cultural background appears to be american, based on the use of english language and the references to college and family.

based on these cues, i assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. leonard's response seems to be laced with sarcasm, as he is downplaying the significance of the sweater and implying that it's not a big deal, while also being slightly defensive about his aunt's gift. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

i'll extract the cues from the input text to classify the sarcasm.

**cultural background:** american, likely from a tv show or movie (the big bang theory)

**common knowledge:** the context of the conversation is about a character's aunt making a gift, and the character (leonard) is responding to a question about why their aunt made it.

**topic:** the topic is the gift (ugly, itchy sweater) and the character's relationship with their aunt.

**punctuation:** the text contains commas (,) and a question mark (?)

**special symbols:** none

with these cues, i would classify the input text as:

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* cultural background: none specific, but the mention of yodeling suggests a possible western or european cultural influence.
* rhetorical devices: the use of a sudden change in topic (""can we talk about something else?"") is a rhetorical device, possibly intended to deflect attention or shift the focus.
* special symbols: none.
* keywords: ""yodel"", ""can we talk about something else?""
* common knowledge: yodeling is a traditional singing style, often associated with swiss or austrian culture.

given these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the tone of the response seems playful and tongue-in-cheek, suggesting that sheldon might be making a joke or poking fun at himself. the sudden change in topic and the mention of yodeling, a somewhat unusual and quirky interest, further support this interpretation.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text:

* cultural background: the conversation appears to be from a tv show or movie, likely a comedy or sitcom, given the informal tone and the character's names (sheldon and wolowitz).

* special symbols: none.
* common knowledge: the conversation is about a tv show or movie, and the characters are likely from the show ""the big bang theory"".
* surface emotion: the tone of the text appears to be lighthearted and playful.

given these cues, i would assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the phrase ""do you know that i yodel?"" is likely being said in a sarcastic tone, as sheldon is known for his eccentricities and this is an unusual and somewhat silly thing to bring up. the tone of the conversation is playful and humorous, which suggests that sheldon is being sarcastic rather than genuinely enthusiastic about yodeling.",1,"assistant

* **topic:** the topic is a mundane activity (going home) in the context of a murder mystery dinner, which is an unusual and playful setting.

**label:** **not sarcastic**

the speaker's question seems genuine and curious, and the tone is more playful than sarcastic. the use of ""what do you think i was gonna do at home?"" is a common way to ask a question, and the context suggests that the speaker is simply trying to clarify their plans, rather than being sarcastic.",0,"assistant

here are the extracted cues:

**emotional words:**

* ""thoughtful"" (ironically used to express sarcasm)

**common knowledge:**

* none

**keywords:**

* ""insult"", ""faith"", ""cake"", ""pie""

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony (using ""thoughtful"" to describe sheldon's response, which is actually hurtful)

**emotional contrasts:**

* contrast between the expected response (""cake or pie"" is a typical gift) and the actual response (""an insult to her faith"")

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

1. **common knowledge**: the input text refers to the idea of bringing a gift to someone's mother, which is a common social norm.
2. **context**: the conversation is between howard and sheldon, and they are discussing what to bring to sheldon's mother's house. the tone of the conversation is playful and humorous.
3. **punctuation**: the input text uses a period at the end, which suggests a complete sentence. there are no exclamation marks or question marks, which are often used to convey strong emotions.
4. **emotional words**: the input text uses the word ""thoughtful"", which has a positive connotation. however, the phrase ""insult to her faith"" could be interpreted as having a negative tone.
5. **cultural background**: the conversation references the idea of bringing a gift to someone's mother, which is a common cultural practice in many societies.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the phrase ""an insult to her faith is always thoughtful"" is a clear example of sarcasm, as sheldon is implying that bringing an insult to someone's faith is not thoughtful at all, but rather the opposite. the tone of the conversation is playful and humorous, which suggests that sheldon is being sarcastic rather than genuinely suggesting that an insult is thoughtful.",0,"assistant

### extraction:

**topic:** gift-giving and sheldon's unconventional approach

**language style:** conversational, humorous, and ironic

* irony: sheldon's statement ""i'm bringing the gift of knowledge"" is ironic because it's not a traditional gift, and howard's response is even more ironic as he's making fun of it.
* hyperbole: sheldon's claim that an insult to her faith is always thoughtful is an exaggeration.

**emotional words:** the text contains emotional words such as ""great"", which is an adjective that conveys a positive emotion.

**context:** the context is a conversation between friends who have just time-traveled to the future. penny's statement is a response to the introduction to the future, and her sarcastic tone is likely a reaction to the absurdity of the situation.

reasoning: the input text has a sarcastic tone, as amy is making a proposal to live with sheldon, but her tone is dismissive and unenthusiastic, indicated by the phrases ""oh, sure"" and the way she quickly retracts the offer. the use of ""you and..."" also implies a sense of obligation rather than genuine interest in living together. the sarcastic tone is evident in the way amy is presenting the idea, which is not a genuine suggestion, but rather a way to poke fun at sheldon's concerns about living alone.",1,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be a mixture of concern and humor, as amy is suggesting a potential living arrangement with sheldon.

**special symbols:** none present in this input text.

**language style:** the language style is informal and conversational, with a touch of playfulness.

**label:** **sarcastic**

amy's tone and language suggest that she is not being entirely serious about her suggestion to live together, and her use of ""oh, sure"" at the end implies a hint of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

here are the cues extracted from the input text:

**emotional words:** ""don't"", ""perhaps"", ""oh, sure"" (neutral tone, but could be interpreted as sarcastic)

**context:** the conversation is about sheldon moving out and possibly living alone, and amy is suggesting they could live together if he doesn't like it.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be concern or willingness to help sheldon, but the tone is subtle and could be interpreted as sarcastic.

**rhetorical devices:** amy's response contains a rhetorical question (""you and... oh, sure"") which could be seen as sarcastic, implying that amy doesn't really want to live with sheldon.

**topic:** the topic is sheldon's potential living situation and amy's suggestion to live together.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with a conversational tone, which is typical of a sitcom dialogue.

**cultural background:** the context is a tv show, specifically ""the big bang theory"", which is an american sitcom. the cultural background is likely western, specifically american.

**emotional words:** there are no explicit emotional words in the input text, but the tone is playful and witty, which can be an indication of sarcasm.

**sarcastic**

the input text is likely intended to be humorous and ironic, and the phrase ""the field of robotics really took a hit"" is an exaggeration and a playful jab at howard's character, who is known for his interest in robotics. the tone is lighthearted and witty, which is consistent with the show's style and the character of raj.",1,"assistant

### context:
the context is a conversation between friends, specifically about robot girlfriends and prostitutes. the tone is lighthearted and humorous, with a hint of playfulness.

### emotional words:
the input text contains the emotional word ""hit"", which has a negative connotation, implying that something has been damaged or affected negatively.

### punctuation:

### surface emotion:
the surface emotion is likely sarcasm, as the statement ""the field of robotics really took a hit"" is an unexpected and ironic response to the initial conversation about robot girlfriends and prostitutes. the tone is tongue-in-cheek, implying that the speaker is being facetious rather than genuinely concerned about the field of robotics.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label ""sarcastic"" to the input text.",1,"assistant

**cues extracted:**

* **special symbols:** none
* **context:** the context is a conversation between characters from the tv show ""the big bang theory"". sheldon is known for his eccentricities and sarcasm.
* **rhetorical devices:** the sentence ""next time i might be in a rush, it's good to have a few in the bank"" uses a rhetorical device called irony. sheldon is implying that he might be in a rush, but the phrase ""a few in the bank"" is often used to refer to having a reserve of money, not a reserve of names (penny). this suggests that sheldon is being sarcastic.
* **punctuation:** the sentence structure and punctuation are normal and do not indicate sarcasm.
* **common knowledge:** the character sheldon is known for his sarcastic humor and wit.

**label:** **sarcastic**

sheldon's sentence is likely intended to be sarcastic, as he is using irony to make a humorous comment about having a reserve of names (penny) instead of money.",1,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

1. **language style:** the language used is formal and conversational, with a hint of dryness.
2. **emotional contrasts:** the statement is neutral and matter-of-fact, without any emotional ups and downs.
3. **common knowledge:** the concept of having a few ""in the bank"" is a common phrase used in everyday life, implying that the speaker is being practical and prepared.
4. **emotional words:** there are no emotional words in the statement that would indicate sarcasm.
5. **punctuation:** the punctuation is standard and doesn't convey any irony or emphasis.

**label:** **not sarcastic**

the statement appears to be a genuine suggestion, and the language used is straightforward and practical. there is no hint of sarcasm or irony in the tone, making it a neutral and non-sarcastic statement.",0,"assistant

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

**common knowledge:** the context of the conversation suggests that sheldon is known for his eccentric behavior and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which may be relevant to understanding his tone.

**punctuation:** the sentence is written in a straightforward and simple manner, without any obvious punctuation cues that would suggest sarcasm.

**emotional words:** the sentence does not contain any emotional words that would typically indicate sarcasm, such as ""ridiculous"", ""amazing"", or ""incredible"".

**context:** the conversation is about having a few ""penny""s (a reference to a character's name) in reserve, which seems to be a peculiar topic. however, without more context, it's difficult to determine if sheldon is being sarcastic or not.

**surface emotion:** the sentence appears to be neutral or matter-of-fact, without any obvious emotional tone.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as:

**label:** 'sarcastic'

my reasoning is that sheldon's comment seems out of place in the conversation, and the topic of having a few ""penny""s in reserve is unusual. the sentence's tone is neutral, but the context and common knowledge about sheldon's character suggest that he might be being sarcastic.",0,0

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony: the speaker is saying they're ""wondering"" how they'll ever sleep without the snoring, which is unlikely, implying that they actually want to sleep without it.
* sarcasm: the speaker is using irony to convey their true feelings, which is that they're annoyed or frustrated with the snoring.

**punctuation:**

* no punctuation stands out as particularly relevant to the sarcasm classification.

**surface emotion:**

* the surface emotion appears to be one of annoyance or frustration, which is being conveyed through the use of sarcasm.

**keywords:**

* ""snore"" - a key word that indicates the topic of the conversation and the source of the speaker's annoyance.
* ""wondering"" - a keyword that suggests the speaker is being ironic and sarcastic.

**common knowledge:**

* snoring is generally considered to be a disturbance to sleep, so it's common knowledge that people usually prefer quiet environments for sleeping.

**label:**

based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the use of irony and sarcasm, combined with the surface emotion of annoyance, indicate that the speaker is being sarcastic in their response.",1,"assistant

**extracted cues:**

* emotional words: ""snore"" (neutral tone), ""wondering"" (curious tone), ""ever"" (slightly negative tone)
* cultural background: none
* topic: sleeping and snoring
* punctuation: none
* special symbols: none

**analysis:**

the tone of the response is clearly sarcastic. the speaker, sheldon, is pretending to be grateful for the snoring sound, which is an unusual and ironic thing to say. the use of ""wondering how i'll ever sleep without it"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it implies that the speaker is actually annoyed by the snoring, not grateful.

**label:** **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* emotional contrasts: the speaker's tone is contrasting with the literal meaning of the words. the words ""i'm listening to you snore"" suggest that the speaker is actually annoyed by the snoring, not appreciative.
* context: the conversation is between two friends, leonard and sheldon, in a casual setting.
* punctuation: there is no punctuation in the input text, but the lack of punctuation suggests a conversational tone, which is typical of sarcastic speech.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is one of annoyance or frustration, as sheldon is complaining about the snoring.
* topic: the topic of the conversation is the snoring and its effect on sheldon's sleep.

based on these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the tone of the conversation is playful and ironic, and the words are used to express annoyance and frustration rather than genuine appreciation for the snoring.",1,1

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i would assign the label as follows:

**common knowledge:** the input text is a conversation between two characters, howard and bernadette, and the topic is about their relationship and household responsibilities.

**cultural background:** the conversation is likely set in a western culture, possibly in the united states, given the context of a married couple discussing their daily lives.

**language style:** the language used is informal and conversational, with a tone that is somewhat playful and lighthearted.

**emotional contrasts:** the input text contains a contrast between bernadette's expectations and howard's response. bernadette mentions that she works and does all the cleaning, implying that she expects some recognition or appreciation for her efforts. however, howard's response is somewhat flippant, saying he's ""okay with that,"" which may be interpreted as dismissive or uncaring.

**keywords:** the keywords from the input text are ""work,"" ""cleaning,"" ""okay with that,"" which suggest a conversation about household responsibilities and the division of labor.

**label:** based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label as **sarcastic**. bernadette's statement is a sarcastic commentary on her own workload and howard's lack of appreciation or effort. the use of the phrase ""and you're okay with that"" is a classic sarcastic tone, implying that howard is not really okay with it, but rather just tolerating it.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* special symbols: none
* emotional contrasts: the phrase ""and yet"" in the original dialogue suggests a contrast between the expected and actual emotions or actions. in this input, the phrase ""and i love"" is repeated, which creates a sense of irony and contrast between the expected and actual emotions.
* rhetorical devices: the phrase ""and i love"" is a rhetorical device used to express irony and sarcasm. the use of the word ""love"" in this context is an exaggeration and is meant to convey the opposite emotion.
* keywords: ""work"", ""do all the cleaning"", ""okay with that"" - these keywords suggest that bernadette is making a humorous comment about her household responsibilities.
* common knowledge: the common knowledge that household chores are typically shared between partners, but in this case, bernadette is implying that she is shouldering all the responsibility.

### analysis:

the input text is an example of sarcasm because it uses irony and exaggeration to convey the opposite emotion. bernadette is not actually ""loving"" that she has to work and do all the cleaning, but rather is expressing her frustration and annoyance in a humorous way. the use of the phrase ""and i love"" is a rhetorical device that creates a sense of irony and contrast, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label:

sarcastic",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

**emotional contrasts**: the text contains a contrast between the speaker's expectations and the reality of the situation. bernadette expresses that she loves working and doing all the cleaning, which is an unexpected statement, given that it's typically a chore.

**language style**: the language used is straightforward and matter-of-fact, without any obvious irony or humor.

**punctuation**: the text uses a simple sentence structure with no unusual punctuation.

**special symbols**: none.

**common knowledge**: the text references a common domestic arrangement where one person works and the other person does household chores.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the statement ""and i love that i work and do all the cleaning, and you're okay with that"" is likely meant to be ironic, as it's unlikely that bernadette genuinely loves doing all the cleaning. the tone is more likely to be humorous and playful, with a hint of sarcasm.",1,1

**common knowledge:** surgery, infection, blood clots, barn spiders, and the risk of complications

**emotional words:** none

**surface emotion:** concern or seriousness (sheldon is warning amy about the potential risks)

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone of sheldon's response is not entirely serious, as he is using hyperbole and exaggeration to make a point. the phrase ""a barn spider lay eggs in your nose"" is an unlikely and humorous scenario, which suggests that sheldon is being sarcastic.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the label as follows:

**cues:**

1. **emotional contrasts**: the text expresses a mix of emotions, from concern to annoyance, which is a common pattern in sarcastic speech.
2. **punctuation**: the use of a comma after ""no"" creates a pause, which can be a marker of sarcasm.
3. **common knowledge**: the mention of a ""barn spider"" is an unusual and somewhat humorous detail, which is not typically found in non-sarcastic conversations.
4. **language style**: the text's tone is formal and somewhat pedantic, which is an unusual style for a non-sarcastic conversation.
5. **special symbols**: none.

**label:** **sarcastic**

* rhetorical devices: sheldon is using hyperbole (""an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose"") to emphasize his point and express his anxiety
* context: the conversation is about a recent surgery and the potential risks involved
* special symbols: none

given these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text. sheldon's use of hyperbole and his tone of concern and frustration suggest that he is being sarcastic, rather than genuinely concerned about the risks of infection, blood clots, and barn spiders in the nose.",1,1

### label:
sarcastic

the tone of the sentence is lighthearted and playful, but the words used are also slightly mocking. the phrase ""even when i have to pee in the morning"" implies that the speaker's partner is being self-absorbed, and the sentence as a whole is meant to be humorous and ironic. the label ""sarcastic"" best captures the tone and intent of the sentence.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**common knowledge:** none

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony: the statement ""i love that you take pride in your looks, even when i have to pee in the morning, and you're in there spending an hour on your hair"" is ironic because it's a sarcastic comment about someone's vanity, which is not typically associated with a positive trait.

**topic:** the topic is the speaker's (bernadette) opinion about the person's ( likely sheldon's) vanity.

**keywords:** ""take pride in your looks"", ""even when i have to pee in the morning"", ""spending an hour on your hair""

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion is annoyance or frustration, as the speaker is expressing a negative sentiment towards the person's vanity.

based on these cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone and language used by bernadette suggest that she is being facetious and mocking sheldon's vanity, rather than genuinely expressing admiration for his appearance.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the text has a contrast between the positive statement ""i love that you take pride in your looks"" and the humorous, relatable, and possibly ironic mention of having to pee in the morning, which creates a comedic tone.

**common knowledge:** the context of the conversation is likely a romantic relationship, as bernadette is addressing sheldon's vanity.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be affectionate and playful, as bernadette is expressing love and appreciation for sheldon's vanity.

**language style:** the language is informal, conversational, and slightly sarcastic, with a dash of humor.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone is playful and affectionate, but the mention of having to pee in the morning adds a layer of irony and humor, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,1

to classify the input text as sarcastic or not sarcastic, i'll extract the cues from the context and input text.

### context:

* the conversation is between friends, which suggests a casual and playful tone.
* sheldon's comment about spraying raid in someone's brain implies a sense of absurdity and humor.
* bernadette's comment about sheldon's hair suggests a lighthearted and teasing tone.

### input:

* howard's comment ""i love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink"" seems to be a criticism or a joke about someone being too proud to use the kitchen sink for personal hygiene.

### cues:

* language style: the tone is informal and conversational, which suggests a humorous or playful intent.
* rhetorical devices: the use of irony and sarcasm is evident in howard's comment, as he's pretending to admire someone's supposed high standards, but is actually mocking them.
* cultural background: the context is a sitcom, which implies a familiarity with comedic tropes and conventions.
* common knowledge: the conversation is about personal habits and hygiene, which is a relatable topic for many people.

### label:

based on the cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the tone, language style, and rhetorical devices all suggest that howard is being sarcastic, and the context of the conversation supports this interpretation.",0,"assistant

**cues:**

1. **punctuation:** the sentence ends with a period (.), which is a typical punctuation mark for a statement.
2. **language style:** the language used is informal, conversational, and playful, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.
3. **rhetorical devices:** the sentence employs a rhetorical device called ""irony"" by saying ""i love"" (a positive sentiment) when the speaker is actually expressing disdain or annoyance.
4. **topic:** the topic is about howard's comment on bernadette's habit of peeing in the morning, which is a relatable and mundane topic.
5. **emotional words:** the sentence doesn't contain explicit emotional words, but the tone is implied to be sarcastic and critical.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the sentence is sarcastic because howard is expressing the opposite of what he truly means. he's saying he loves something (bernadette's habit) when in reality, he's probably annoyed or disgusted by it. the tone is playful and ironic, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,1

i'd be happy to classify the response as sarcastic or not sarcastic!

here are the cues i extracted:

* **emotional contrasts**: the response doesn't explicitly state a contrasting emotion, but the context of the conversation and the question being asked (""doesn't professor abbott's family want any of this stuff?"") implies a neutral or objective tone, which contrasts with the gross and unexpected discovery of the dentures mentioned in the previous conversation.
* **punctuation**: the response uses a question mark (?) which is a neutral punctuation mark, not indicating any strong emotional tone.
* **emotional words**: there are no explicit emotional words in the response.
* **language style**: the language used is straightforward and simple, asking a question about the family's potential interest in the professor's belongings.
* **rhetorical devices**: there are no obvious rhetorical devices used in the response.

based on these cues, i would classify the response as **sarcastic**. the question being asked seems to be a genuine inquiry, but the tone and context of the conversation suggest that howard might be being facetious or ironic, implying that the family wouldn't want any of the stuff, given the gross discovery of the dentures.",0,"assistant

* common knowledge: professor abbott, cleaning out a dead professor's office (context-dependent)
* punctuation: none
* special symbols: none

### extraction of cues:

* punctuation: the input text contains a question mark (?) at the end, which is a common way to end a sentence that is asking a question.
* common knowledge: the context is about a professor's office, which is a common scenario.

based on these cues, i would assign the label:

the use of the word ""dummy"" to refer to oneself is a clear example of sarcasm, as it is an exaggeration and not meant to be taken literally. the tone of the sentence also implies skepticism and unconfidence, which are common characteristics of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

### response:
the emotional word that stands out in this input is ""dummy"", which has a negative connotation and implies that howard is not capable or intelligent. this word choice is likely intended to convey a sense of self-deprecation or humility, but it also has a sarcastic tone.

there are no special symbols in this input.

the language style is informal, with a conversational tone, which is typical of dialogue in a tv show or movie.

the rhetorical device used in this input is understatement, as howard is downplaying his abilities and implying that he is not capable of handling a simple task like guiding someone with a blanket.

the common knowledge is that a blanket is not a complicated object, and it's unlikely that howard would need to be guided by someone else to use it.

### label:

### response:

the topic of the input text is a conversation about buying clothes, specifically lingerie, and the speaker's (penny) suggestion to have their mom send them pants from walmart.

the rhetorical devices used in the input text are irony and sarcasm. penny's statement ""no, you're right, we should do what you do. have our mom send us pants from the walmart in houston"" is an example of sarcasm, as she is not actually suggesting that they should follow sheldon's behavior of having their mom send them clothes. instead, she is mocking his idea and implying that it's ridiculous.

the surface emotion expressed in the input text is likely annoyance or frustration, as penny is reacting to sheldon's previous statement and is expressing her disagreement with his suggestion.

there is no cultural background mentioned in the input text, but it appears to be set in a contemporary american context.

there are no special symbols used in the input text.

### label:

	+ sarcasm (penny's tone and words are meant to be mocking and playful)
* language style: informal, conversational
* keywords: ""mom"", ""walmart"", ""houston"", ""pants""

**label:** sarcastic",1,"assistant

**cultural background:** american, as the conversation is set in a department store in the united states and references to walmart and houston.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be frustration or annoyance, as penny is expressing her agreement with sheldon's statement and suggesting a way to avoid the situation.

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge is that women often enjoy shopping for clothes and making a big production out of it, which is a stereotype that sheldon is referencing.

**emotional words:** the emotional words used are ""right"", ""should"", and ""annoying"", which convey a sense of frustration and agreement.

**context:** the context is a conversation between friends in a department store, where they are discussing their experience of shopping for clothes.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because penny's response is not a genuine suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment aimed at mocking sheldon's suggestion. the tone is playful and ironic, and the language used is exaggerated and humorous, which are all characteristics of sarcasm.",1,1

**extracted cues:**

* **keywords:** ""perhaps"", ""by mistake"", ""don't know""

* **context:** the conversation is about a lost bag, and the speaker (person) is responding to bernadette's question about the whereabouts of the bag.
* **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake"" is an example of a non-committal or hedging statement, which is a common feature of sarcastic language. the use of ""perhaps"" and ""by mistake"" implies that the speaker is not taking responsibility for the loss of the bag and is instead deflecting the blame.
* **topic:** the topic of the conversation is the lost bag.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of the response is sarcastic because the speaker is using a non-committal phrase to avoid taking responsibility for the loss of the bag. the use of ""perhaps"" and ""by mistake"" implies that the speaker is not taking the loss seriously and is instead making a vague excuse. the response also has a slightly dismissive tone, which is a common feature of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

**cues:**

* **language style:** the language used is casual and conversational, with a hint of uncertainty and innocence.

* **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the serious tone of the previous conversation and the sudden, unexpected suggestion of getting a turtle creates a humorous and playful atmosphere.

based on the input text, i will extract the cues to classify the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

**emotional contrasts:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is positive (celebrating a decision to take a step forward), but the context suggests that the tone may be ironic or humorous.

**language style:** the language used is straightforward and lacks any obvious emotional markers, but the sudden shift in topic and the unexpected reference to champagne and turtles hint at a playful or ironic tone.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed is neutral, but the context and language style suggest that there may be a deeper emotional tone.

**context:** the context is a conversation where the group is making a decision, and the sudden shift in topic and the unexpected reference to champagne and turtles suggests that the tone may be humorous or ironic.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely western, as the reference to champagne and turtles is a common idiomatic expression in western cultures.

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony (specifically, verbal irony): the speaker says that half a dozen menorahs sets a mood, implying that it's an unusual or excessive number, and that the mood might not necessarily be a good one.

**keywords:**

* menorahs (a jewish symbol)
* mood (implying that the atmosphere is being created or affected by the menorahs)

**cultural background:**

* jewish (the menorah is a jewish symbol, and the context is likely a social gathering or celebration)

**context:**

* the conversation is taking place in a social setting, likely a gathering of friends or acquaintances.
* the previous speaker (penny) mentioned that the room looks ""really pretty in here"", which suggests that the atmosphere is being discussed.

**special symbols:**

* none

**label:**

* **sarcastic**

the speaker's tone is likely sarcastic because they're implying that having multiple menorahs in the room is unusual or excessive, and that it might not be creating a pleasant atmosphere. the use of irony and the cultural reference to menorahs also suggest a sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

* common knowledge: menorahs are typically associated with the jewish faith and are often lit during the holiday of hanukkah. the mention of half a dozen menorahs might be unexpected in a casual setting.

* special symbols: none
* cultural background: the mention of menorahs implies a cultural or religious reference.
* keywords from the input text: ""half a dozen menorahs"", ""sets a mood""

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as 'sarcastic'. the tone of the statement seems to be ironic, implying that having half a dozen menorahs in a room is not a typical or expected decor choice, and the speaker is being facetious about its impact on the mood.",0,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

**emotional words:** ""sad"", ""before"" (implying a sense of familiarity and possibly a hint of melancholy)

**cultural background:** american culture, as the dialogue appears to be from a tv show or movie

**keywords:** ""dinner"", ""occasion"", ""here so many times before"" (indicating a sense of routine)

**rhetorical devices:** none explicitly present, but the use of ""so many times before"" could be seen as a rhetorical device to emphasize the familiarity of the situation

**common knowledge:** the concept of a dinner gathering with friends, the idea of having a routine or familiar experience, and the possibility of a hint of sadness or melancholy

### analysis:

the input text appears to be a continuation of a conversation, with bernadette expressing a desire to have a familiar dinner experience with friends. the use of emotional words like ""sad"" and the cultural background of american culture suggest a relatable and possibly sentimental tone. the keywords ""dinner"", ""occasion"", and ""here so many times before"" imply a sense of routine and familiarity, which could be interpreted as a subtle hint of sadness or melancholy. the rhetorical devices used are not overtly sarcastic, and the common knowledge presented is not contradictory to a non-sarcastic tone.

**emotional words:** there are no overtly emotional words in the input text.

**keywords:** the keywords are ""kind of dinner"", ""we've all had here so many times before"", which suggest a sense of familiarity and routine.

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the input as:

**emotional words:** wow (expressing surprise or excitement)

**context:** the input text is a continuation of the conversation between stuart and howard, where howard wished stuart a happy birthday. the topic is still about a denny's restaurant in vegas.

**special symbols:** none

**surface emotion:** surprise or excitement (due to the use of the word ""wow"")

**language style:** informal and casual (using colloquial expressions like ""wow"")

considering these cues, i would assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the use of ""wow"" in this context suggests that penny is being sarcastic, implying that it's not a big deal or surprising that there's a denny's in vegas where you can get married. the tone is likely ironic or mocking, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed by penny is one of surprise and perhaps excitement.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is not explicitly mentioned, but the reference to getting married in a denny's in vegas suggests a western cultural context.

**special symbols:** there are no special symbols in the input text.

**keywords:** the keywords are ""denny's"", ""vegas"", ""get married"", which suggest a humorous or ironic tone.

**emotional words:** the emotional words are ""wow"", which is often used to express surprise or excitement, but in this context, it could also be used to convey sarcasm.

based on these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone of the statement is likely ironic, as it is unlikely that penny would actually want to get married in a denny's. the use of ""wow"" and the unexpected twist of getting married in a denny's suggests a sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

**cultural background:** american (denny's is a popular american diner chain)

**emotional words:** none

**topic:** a surprising or unusual fact about denny's in las vegas

**special symbols:** none

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of the sentence is casual and conversational, but the phrase ""wow, there's a denny's in vegas you can actually get married in"" is likely meant to be ironic or humorous, implying that getting married at denny's is not a desirable or romantic option. the use of ""wow"" at the beginning of the sentence, which is often used to express surprise or excitement, is also being used in a tongue-in-cheek way to add to the sarcastic tone.",1,1

**language style:** the language style is informal, with a conversational tone, which is typical of close friends or acquaintances.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be apologetic and anxious, as chandler expresses concern about having scared the person and being ""hopeless and awkward and desperate for love"".

**emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between chandler's apologetic and anxious tone and the person's initial sarcastic tone, which was hinted at in the context provided (""i wasn't even that hungry"").

**rhetorical devices:** chandler uses a rhetorical device called ""understatement"" by downplaying his intentions and making himself seem more vulnerable than he actually is.

**cultural background:** the cultural background appears to be american, given the context of the conversation and the use of informal language.

considering these cues, i assign the label as: **sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because chandler's apologetic tone and language style are likely ironic, and his words are meant to be humorous or playful, rather than genuinely heartfelt. the use of understatement and the contrast with the person's initial sarcastic tone also suggest that chandler is being sarcastic.",1,1

**reasoning:** although chandler is apologizing and seems to be genuinely sorry, the tone of the apology is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't quite match the surface emotion of apology. the phrase ""i was very drunk and it was someone else's subconscious"" sounds like a weak excuse, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. additionally, the topic of the conversation is a bit unusual and awkward, which adds to the suspicion of sarcasm.",1,1

based on these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text.",1,"assistant

### analysis:

**language style:** chandler's response is characterized by a sudden and unexpected question, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. the use of the word ""burying"" instead of ""talking"" or ""hanging out"" also suggests a playful and ironic tone.

**common knowledge:** there is no specific common knowledge required to understand the conversation, but the context of ross's previous statement about being at the woman's mercy implies a romantic or intimate situation.

**context:** the context of the conversation is a discussion about ross's late arrival, and chandler's question is an unexpected and humorous twist that implies ross was engaging in some kind of romantic or illicit activity.

**emotional contrasts:** the emotional tone of chandler's response is playful and mocking, contrasting with the seriousness and intimacy implied in ross's previous statement.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely american, given the context of the conversation and the use of colloquial language.

**sarcastic**

here's why:

* **common knowledge**: the context of the conversation is a wedding, and the ring is a significant item. this is common knowledge, and the speaker is likely to be aware of its importance.
* **emotional contrasts**: the speaker, chandler, is responding to a dramatic and urgent situation (the ring being stolen), but his tone is casual and humorous. this contrast between the gravity of the situation and the speaker's lighthearted response suggests sarcasm.
* **context**: the conversation is taking place during a wedding, and the speaker is addressing the best man (joey) about losing the ring. this context adds to the humor and playfulness of the situation, making sarcasm more likely.
* **language style**: the speaker's language is informal, and the use of colloquial expressions like ""ha ha!"" and ""you the worst best man ever!"" suggests a casual, tongue-in-cheek tone.
* **special symbols**: there are no special symbols in this input text that would suggest a different interpretation.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that chandler's response is intended to be humorous and sarcastic, rather than a genuine expression of concern or upset.",1,"assistant

**label:** **sarcastic**

chandler's response is sarcastic because he's using irony and exaggeration to express his frustration and annoyance at losing the ring. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, but the words themselves convey a sense of disappointment and criticism. the use of ""ha ha!"" and ""you the worst best man ever!"" adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's a humorous way of saying ""this is ridiculous"" and ""you're really messing up.""",1,"assistant

### language style:

### label:
**sarcastic**

the label is **sarcastic** because the input text uses a dry, ironic tone to comment on joey's original plan, which is a clear exaggeration and not a serious medical concern. the use of a bad hernia as a contrast to joey's plan to get laser eye surgery is a classic example of sarcastic humor.",1,"assistant

based on the given cues, i will extract the following information:

* cultural background: american (based on the tv show friends)
* surface emotion: neutral (the tone is calm and matter-of-fact)
* context: the conversation is between friends, specifically chandler and joey, discussing a gift
* topic: the topic is the delay in delivering the gift
* punctuation: the text is written in a conversational style with no punctuation

considering these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of chandler's response seems sarcastic because he's making a joke about joey's ""quack quack"" sound effect earlier, implying that joey is being ridiculous or silly. the phrase ""but now we understand you were doing this"" is also a hint of sarcasm, as it's an understatement and doesn't fully convey the actual meaning, which is probably ""we're annoyed that it took so long"".",1,"assistant

### cues:

* common knowledge: the conversation is taking place among friends, likely in a casual setting. the phrase ""gift"" suggests that they are exchanging presents.
* context: the previous statement by joey (""quack quack, quack quack, quack quack."") is nonsensical and playful, which sets a lighthearted tone for the conversation.
* surface emotion: chandler's statement appears to be neutral, without an obvious emotional tone.
* emotional words: none are explicitly present, but the tone of the conversation is likely playful and humorous.
* rhetorical devices: chandler's statement is a form of understatement, implying that joey's quacking was unnecessary and took up time.

### label:

based on the cues, i would assign a label of 'not sarcastic' to chandler's statement. while it's possible to interpret the statement as slightly sarcastic, the tone of the conversation and the playful nature of the previous statement by joey suggest that chandler is more likely being lighthearted and humorous rather than sarcastic.",0,"assistant

### cues:

* **context:** joey: quack quack, quack quack, quack quack. (this context suggests a playful and perhaps silly tone, which might influence the interpretation of the input text.)
* **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the playful context and the serious topic of a delayed gift suggests that the input text might be ironic or sarcastic.
* **emotional words:** none explicitly emotional words are present in the input text.
* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the input text appears to be neutral or even slightly annoyed, as it expresses understanding and acceptance of the delayed gift.
* **language style:** the language style is straightforward and matter-of-fact, which might be a characteristic of sarcastic speech.

### label:
**sarcastic**

the input text is likely sarcastic because it uses a neutral tone to express understanding and acceptance of a delayed gift, which might be an unexpected response given the context and the emotional contrast between the playful context and the serious topic. the straightforward language style also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it downplays the potential frustration or annoyance that one might feel in a situation like this.",1,1

* **emotional contrasts**: the tone of the statement is playful and humorous, which is typical of sarcastic language.
* **punctuation**: the use of a question mark at the beginning of chandler's statement is unusual, as it's not a genuine question. this punctuation suggests that the statement is meant to be ironic or humorous.

### cues:

* rhetorical devices: the phrase ""maybe he was nervous"" is an example of a non-sequitur, a rhetorical device that is used to interrupt the conversation and shift the focus away from the original topic. it's also a form of understatement, which is a common device used in sarcasm.
* punctuation: the lack of punctuation after ""maybe he was nervous"" makes it sound like a genuine suggestion, rather than a sarcastic remark.
* common knowledge: the conversation is about a display of human fossils, and the speakers are discussing the posture of ostralopificus and homohabilus. this common knowledge provides context for the sarcasm.
* topic: the topic of the conversation is the display of human fossils and the posture of the fossils.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the input text is a neutral or even skeptical tone, which is a common way to disguise sarcasm.

### label: 

based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the phrase ""maybe he was nervous"" is likely meant to be ironic, implying that the person was not nervous at all, but rather that the suggestion is ridiculous. the tone is casual and conversational, which makes it harder to detect, but the use of a non-sequitur and understatement are clear indicators of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* keywords: ""nervous"", ""maybe""
* punctuation: none notable
* rhetorical devices: irony (implying that the speaker is not buying the excuse)
* common knowledge: none notable
* topic: fossil display and human evolution

### analysis:

the response ""maybe he was nervous"" is likely sarcastic because it's an unlikely explanation for ostralopificus not being fully erect. the use of ""maybe"" and the tone of the response suggest that the speaker is not seriously considering this excuse, but rather is being ironic or mocking. the absence of any other plausible explanation and the context of the previous conversation about fossil displays and human evolution also support the interpretation that the response is sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1,"assistant

### cues extracted:

1. **punctuation**: none
2. **emotional contrasts**: the phrase ""maybe he was nervous"" implies a contrasting emotional tone to the previous statement, which was more serious and factual.
3. **topic**: the topic is still about ostralopificus and its supposed lack of erectness.
4. **cultural background**: no specific cultural background is mentioned in this exchange.
5. **special symbols**: none

### analysis:

the response from chandler (""maybe he was nervous"") seems to be a lighthearted and playful way to address the situation, which is unusual given the scientific and serious tone of the previous conversation. this contrast in tone and emotional intensity suggests that chandler is being sarcastic.

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**cultural background:** american (assuming it's a dialogue from the tv show friends)

**special symbols:** none

**emotional words:** ""killed"", ""wrong"" (these words have a negative connotation, but in this context, they are likely being used sarcastically)

**keywords:** ""killed"" (a strong word that's often used to convey a serious or violent action), ""stick of gum"" (a relatively trivial thing to kill someone over)

**punctuation:** none

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the use of the word ""killed"" in a humorous and exaggerated way, combined with the absurdity of killing someone over a stick of gum, strongly suggests that chandler is being sarcastic.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**punctuation:** the input text contains a question mark at the end, which is a common way to end a question.

**cultural background:** the text does not contain any specific cultural references that would indicate sarcasm.

**keywords:** the keywords in the text are ""killed him"", which is a strong phrase that could be interpreted as literal.

**common knowledge:** the text assumes that the listener is familiar with the concept of killing someone, which is a common knowledge.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is concern or worry, as chandler is asking if he did something wrong.

considering these cues, it's likely that the input text is **sarcastic**. the phrase ""i killed him"" is an exaggeration and a hyperbole, and the question ""do you think that was wrong?"" is a way to convey that chandler didn't actually kill joey, but rather is joking about it.

therefore, the correct label for the input text is: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* surface emotion: the tone of the sentence is playful and humorous, with a hint of exaggeration.
* special symbols: none.
* cultural background: american, as the dialogue is from a tv show (friends).
* language style: colloquial, informal, and slightly absurd.
* punctuation: the sentence is a single sentence with a question mark at the end.

considering these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the sentence is clearly meant to be humorous and ironic, with chandler making a ridiculous claim about killing joey over a stick of gum. the tone and language style are consistent with chandler's character, who often uses sarcasm and wit in his dialogue.",1,1

* topic: the topic of the conversation is joey's appearance, which is being asked about.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed by chandler is indifference, which is a common way to mask sarcasm.
* punctuation: the lack of punctuation in the response, particularly the absence of an exclamation mark, suggests a tone that is more casual and conversational than one that is genuinely indifferent.
* language style: the use of the phrase ""i don't care"" in a way that seems too casual and dismissive to be genuinely indifferent suggests a language style that is playful and ironic, which is consistent with sarcasm.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text.",1,"assistant

### context:
the context is a conversation between friends, specifically joey and chandler, in a sitcom-like setting. the tone is likely informal and casual.

### cultural background:
the cultural background is american, as the conversation is likely set in the united states and the characters' mannerisms and language are typical of american sitcoms.

### common knowledge:
the common knowledge is that the phrase ""i don't care"" is often used to express indifference or disinterest, but in this context, it's likely being used ironically or sarcastically.

### emotional contrasts:
the emotional contrast is between joey's innocent and vulnerable question (""how do i look?"") and chandler's seemingly dismissive and uncaring response (""i don't care!""), which suggests a contrast between joey's emotional investment and chandler's apparent lack of concern.

### emotional words:
the emotional words are ""care"" and ""don't care"", which are used in a way that implies chandler is being sarcastic.

### response:
based on the cues, the response would be: ""sarcastic"".

### label:
the correct label for the input text is: ""sarcastic"".",1,"assistant

* **topic**: appearance
* **cultural background**: american (based on the context of the tv show friends)

* emotional contrasts: none (no apparent emotional contrast or shift)
* special symbols: none
* surface emotion: neutral/informative (the statement seems to be a factual observation)

### classification:

based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of 'not sarcastic' to the input text. the tone of the statement appears to be neutral and informative, without any apparent emotional contrast or special symbols that would indicate sarcasm.",0,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**emotional contrasts:** none

**emotional words:** none

**cultural background:** none (no specific cultural references)

**keywords:** ""knock"", ""inside""

**rhetorical devices:** irony (specifically, situational irony)

the input text is a statement that is unexpected and counterintuitive, implying that knocking is a necessary action before entering a space, but then contradicting itself by saying that once inside, knocking is no longer necessary. this is an example of situational irony, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

* rhetorical devices: the statement is an example of a witty remark or a play on words, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion appears to be calm and casual, but the tone is slightly ironic.
* keywords: ""knock"" and ""inside"" are the key words that give away the sarcasm.
* punctuation: the lack of punctuation or emphasis on the sentence makes it seem like a straightforward statement, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.
* cultural background: the conversation is likely from a sitcom, specifically friends, which is an american tv show. the language and tone are typical of the show's characters.

based on these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,1

### response:
i'd say the label for this input text is: **sarcastic**

### cues:

1. **punctuation**: the use of a comma after ""not at all"" suggests a pause, which can indicate a tone of irony or sarcasm.
2. **emotional contrasts**: monica's initial statement ""you are dead meat"" is a strong and aggressive statement, while her subsequent statement ""kind of the same lines as, i don't know, having a third nipple!"" is a more lighthearted and humorous comparison, which creates an emotional contrast.
3. **special symbols**: none.
4. **rhetorical devices**: the use of hyperbole (""you are dead meat"") and the absurd comparison (""having a third nipple!"") are rhetorical devices that contribute to the sarcastic tone.
5. **common knowledge**: the audience is likely familiar with the tv show friends and the characters' personalities, which helps to understand the context and tone of the conversation.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that monica's statement is intended to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine expression of anger or aggression.",1,"assistant

here are the extracted cues:

**keywords:** ""not big"", ""same lines"", ""third nipple""

**emotional words:** ""not at all"" (emphasizing the negation), ""kind of"" (softening the tone)

**context:** the conversation is between friends, chandler and monica, in a sitcom-like setting. the topic is a joke about being ""dead meat"".

**cultural background:** american, likely from the 90s or early 2000s (based on the tv show style).

**surface emotion:** monica's tone seems playful and lighthearted, using humor to deflect chandler's previous comment.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to monica's input text. the use of unexpected comparisons (third nipple) and the emphasis on ""not big"" suggests that monica is being playful and ironic, rather than genuinely expressing a serious opinion.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i have extracted the following cues:

* emotional contrasts: the speaker is downplaying the initial statement (""you are dead meat"") by saying it's not a big secret and comparing it to something trivial (having a third nipple).
* rhetorical devices: the use of understatement (""not big, not at all"") and the comparison to a unusual and humorous scenario (having a third nipple) are rhetorical devices.
* emotional words: the word ""dead"" in ""dead meat"" has a strong emotional connotation, as well as the word ""nipple"" which is often considered taboo or embarrassing.
* common knowledge: the concept of having a third nipple is not common knowledge, but it's a well-known fact that some people are born with extra nipples.
* punctuation: the use of the exclamation mark (!) at the end of the sentence adds emphasis and playfulness to the tone.

based on these cues, i would assign the label ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the speaker is using sarcasm to downplay the initial statement and add humor to the conversation.",1,1

### label:
sarcastic

reasoning: chandler's response is sarcastic because he starts with a question that seems genuine, but then immediately follows it with a joke that is likely to be off-color and inappropriate. the use of ""oh please"" and the phrase ""monkey is penis genre"" are clear indicators of sarcasm, as they are meant to be humorous but also slightly offensive.",1,"assistant

#### emotional words:
* none explicitly emotional words are present in the input text, but the tone is playful and joking.

#### common knowledge:
* the reference to the ""monkey"" is likely a joke or a play on words, as it's not a typical topic of conversation.
* the mention of ""penis"" is a common euphemism for a joke or a humorous reference.

#### rhetorical devices:
* the use of irony (""oh please i am allowed one joke..."") and wordplay (""monkey is penis genre"") are rhetorical devices used to create humor and sarcasm.

the conversation is between chandler and rachel, and they are discussing ribbons. this context provides a neutral background for the conversation.

### common knowledge:
there is no specific common knowledge that can be applied to this conversation.

### punctuation:
the punctuation used in the input text is normal, with no unusual or sarcastic punctuation marks.

### language style:
the language style used by chandler is casual and conversational, which is consistent with the tone of the conversation.

### rhetorical devices:
the phrase ""and i think my testicles may be in here too"" is an unexpected and humorous remark that is not directly related to the conversation about ribbons. this sudden shift in topic and the use of a bodily part as an example is a rhetorical device that is often used in sarcastic statements.

**cues:**

* **language style:** informal, conversational tone with a hint of playfulness (e.g., ""no way!"")
* **surface emotion:** surprised, possibly amused (e.g., the exclamation mark)
* **punctuation:** exclamation mark (!) indicates strong emotions or emphasis
* **topic:** the topic of the conversation is the closure of a bar
* **emotional words:** none explicitly, but the tone and language style convey a sense of excitement or playfulness

**label:** **sarcastic**

the response ""no way!"" is a common idiomatic expression used to convey surprise, but in this context, it's likely used to add humor and sarcasm to the conversation. the tone and language style suggest that chandler is not genuinely surprised, but rather poking fun at the news about the bar's closure.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**keywords:** ""no way!""

**cultural background:** american, likely referencing a common idiomatic expression in american english.

**rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""no way!"" is an idiomatic expression that can be classified as an interjection, which is a rhetorical device used to convey strong emotions or reactions.

**common knowledge:** the context of the conversation suggests that the speakers are discussing the closure of a bar, which is a common topic in everyday conversations.

**emotional words:** ""no way!"" is an emotional expression that conveys surprise, shock, or disagreement.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of the response ""no way!"" is not genuine surprise or shock, but rather a sarcastic response to the news of the bar closing down. the use of the idiomatic expression and the emotional tone suggest that chandler is being sarcastic, implying that he doesn't care about the bar closing down.",1,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed by chandler is surprise and possibly excitement, as he responds with ""no way!"" which is a typical reaction to unexpected news.
* **cultural background:** the cultural background is american, as the dialogue is set in a typical american sitcom.
* **topic:** the topic is about a bar closing down, which is a common everyday issue.
* **rhetorical devices:** there is no obvious rhetorical device used in this short dialogue.
* **keywords:** ""no way!"", ""bar"", ""closing down""

**label:** **sarcastic**

**reasoning:** although the surface emotion appears to be surprise, the tone and language used by chandler (""do i ever"") in the previous dialogue suggests a sarcastic undertone. the phrase ""no way!"" in response to the news about the bar closing down is likely meant to be ironic and sarcastic, implying that chandler is not surprised or upset about the news, but rather amused or even pleased.",1,1

the response ""oh"" is a very brief and neutral response. it doesn't convey any strong emotions or sentiment. it's a common way to acknowledge someone's presence or statement without adding much value to the conversation.

### label:
not sarcastic",0,"assistant

**cues:**

* **rhetorical device:** understatement (using a single word ""oh"" to convey a sense of disappointment or annoyance)
* **punctuation:** the lack of punctuation after ""oh"" makes the sentence seem flat and unenthusiastic
* **topic:** the topic is likely the fact that ross is on her paper route, which might be an unwanted or inconvenient situation for rachel
* **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the initial friendly greeting (""hi!"") and the flat, unenthusiastic response (""oh"") suggests a shift in emotional tone
* **emotional words:** ""oh"" can be interpreted as a expression of disappointment, annoyance, or boredom

**label:** **sarcastic**

the combination of the understatement, flat punctuation, and emotional contrast suggests that rachel's response is intended to convey sarcasm, implying that she's not thrilled about ross being on her paper route.",1,1

* **rhetorical devices:** the use of the emoticon :) is a rhetorical device, as it's a visual representation of a smile, which contrasts with the speaker's actual tone.
* **topic:** the topic is still the conversation about the previous event, but the speaker's response is more focused on their own departure.
* **context:** the context is that the speaker is saying goodbye and leaving, which is a common scenario where people might respond with a neutral or brief comment.
* **special symbols:** the emoticon :) is a special symbol used to convey a tone or emotion.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the speaker's response seems to be a way of dismissing the previous conversation and not showing much interest or enthusiasm, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of the emoticon :) adds to the ambiguity, as it could be interpreted as a genuine expression of excitement or a tongue-in-cheek response to the previous conversation.",1,"assistant

**cues extracted:**

* emotional words: ""yeah"" (neutral emotion, but could be interpreted as sarcastic)
* surface emotion: none explicitly stated, but could be interpreted as neutral or sarcastic
* rhetorical devices: none explicitly stated, but the brevity and simplicity of the response could be seen as a form of understatement or irony
* special symbols: "": yeah."" (emoticon and emphasis on the word ""yeah"")
* cultural background: none explicitly stated, but the use of an emoticon and informal language suggests a casual, contemporary cultural background

**label:** sarcastic

the brevity and simplicity of the response, combined with the use of an emoticon and emphasis on the word ""yeah"", suggest a tone of sarcasm. the phrase ""yeah"" could be interpreted as a response to the previous conversation, implying that the speaker is not actually excited or enthusiastic about the topic.",1,"assistant

### response:

after analyzing the input text, i have extracted the following cues:

* **surface emotion**: the text appears to be a brief and informal conversation between friends, with a tone that is playful and lighthearted.
* **special symbols**: none
* **context**: the context is a group of friends (joey, ross, chandler, and phoebe) having a casual conversation, possibly about a ring.
* **emotional words**: none
* **punctuation**: the text only contains exclamation marks (!) and question marks (?), which are typical in informal conversations.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text.

the reason is that phoebe's response ""oh! oop!"" is an unusual and brief response, which could be interpreted as a sarcastic reaction to the previous conversation. the use of ""oh!"" and ""oop!"" could be seen as a playful way of expressing skepticism or annoyance, which is a common trait of sarcastic speech.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the tone of the input text is sudden and unexpected, which could be a cue for sarcasm. phoebe's response ""oh! oop!"" is an unusual and brief response, which may indicate sarcasm.

**punctuation:** there is no punctuation in the input text, but the lack of punctuation could contribute to the ambiguous tone.

**context:** the context is a conversation between friends, and phoebe's response seems out of place compared to the others. this could be a cue for sarcasm, as her response is not a typical or expected response to the conversation.

**cultural background:** the conversation appears to be set in a western cultural context, and the tone and language used are typical of american sitcoms.

based on these cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the sudden and unexpected response, the lack of punctuation, and the context of the conversation all suggest that phoebe's response is intended to be humorous and ironic, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

### extracted cues:

* emotional words: ""oh"", ""oop"" (expressing excitement or surprise)
* topic: wedding or engagement (based on the context of the conversation)
* keywords: ""ring"", ""pocket"", ""pheebs"" (referencing the ring and phoebe's nickname)
* surface emotion: excitement or surprise
* rhetorical devices: none apparent

### classification:

based on the cues extracted, i would classify the input text as:

**sarcastic**

the response ""oh! oop!"" seems to be a playful and exaggerated reaction to chandler's comment about having the ring in his pocket. the tone and language used suggest a lighthearted and humorous intent, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,1

* common knowledge: living with ross is a significant life change, and rachel's reaction is unusually enthusiastic
* context: the conversation is about ross offering to let rachel live with him, which is a significant and intimate gesture
* topic: the topic is rachel's emotional response to ross's offer
* language style: rachel's language is overly dramatic and emphatic, with an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence

considering these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the input text is likely sarcastic because rachel's language and tone are exaggerated and dramatic, which is an unusual response to a simple offer. the phrase ""ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me!"" is particularly suspicious, as it's an overly emphatic and emotional response to a relatively mundane offer.",1,"assistant

### context:
the context is a conversation between rachel and ross, where ross has just offered to help rachel with something, and rachel is expressing her gratitude and enthusiasm.

### input:
rachel: ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me!

### cues:

* **context**: the conversation is about ross helping rachel, which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
* **punctuation**: the use of an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence indicates strong emotions, but it's not enough to suggest sarcasm.
* **cultural background**: no specific cultural background is mentioned, but the conversation seems to be in a western cultural context.
* **common knowledge**: the conversation is about helping someone, which is a common and relatable topic.
* **emotional contrasts**: the sentence expresses strong emotions (enthusiasm and gratitude), but there is no apparent contrast between emotions to suggest sarcasm.

### label:
based on the cues, i would assign a label of **'not sarcastic'** to the input text. the tone and language used by rachel suggest genuine gratitude and enthusiasm, rather than sarcasm.",0,"assistant

based on the given context and input text, i will extract the following cues:

**context:** the conversation is between two friends, rachel and ross, and they are discussing living together. the tone is casual and friendly.

**topic:** the topic is rachel's gratitude towards ross for helping her out.

**emotional contrasts:** the emotional tone of the input text is one of strong emotional contrast. rachel's statement ""ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me!"" implies a high level of emotional intensity, suggesting that she is deeply grateful and possibly even overwhelmed by ross's help.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely western, given the casual and informal tone of the conversation.

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge is that ross has helped rachel in some way, which is not specified in the input text but is implied by the conversation context.

based on these cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the emotional intensity and contrast in the text suggest that rachel is being genuine and heartfelt, rather than sarcastic.",1,1

**context**: the response is part of a conversation between joey and rachel, which is a familiar and casual setting

**surface emotion**: the surface emotion expressed in the response is neutral or relaxed, with no obvious emotional tone

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**punctuation:** the input text contains an exclamation mark (!) at the end, which is often used to convey strong emotions or emphasis.

**emotional contrasts:** there is no explicit emotional contrast in this short input text, but we can infer that the speaker is trying to be cheerful and optimistic (""yeah! look!"") which might be in contrast to a potential sarcastic tone.

**emotional words:** there are no explicit emotional words in this input text.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be one of excitement or enthusiasm, as indicated by the use of the exclamation mark and the phrase ""yeah! look!"".

**keywords:** the keyword ""look"" might be a potential indicator of sarcasm, as it could be used to express irony or mocking.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the use of the exclamation mark and the phrase ""yeah! look!"" might be a way to mask sarcasm, but the keyword ""look"" and the potential emotional contrast with the previous conversation (rachel's concern about the stain) suggest that the speaker might be being sarcastic.",1,0

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""you'd better act surprised"" implies a contrast between the expected emotional response (surprise) and the actual emotional response (pretended surprise, which is sarcastic).

**punctuation:** the sentence is a simple statement without any unusual punctuation.

**rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""you'd better act surprised"" uses a rhetorical device called ""hyperbole"" (exaggeration) to emphasize the expected response.

**keywords:** ""act surprised"" (implying a fake surprise)

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text.",1,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the input text is likely to be playful or humorous, as joey is suggesting that monica pretend to be surprised.

**rhetorical devices:** the input text contains a rhetorical device, specifically a sarcastic remark. joey is implying that monica is not genuinely surprised, but rather that she should pretend to be.

**special symbols:** there are no special symbols in the input text.

**emotional words:** the emotional words in the input text are ""act"" and ""surprised"", which convey a sense of pretending or faking emotions.

**cultural background:** the cultural background of the text appears to be western, likely american, given the context of the conversation and the use of colloquial language.

**label:** based on the extracted cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* punctuation: none
* rhetorical devices: irony (the phrase ""you'd better act surprised"" implies that the speaker expects the opposite reaction)
* topic: birthday party planning
* emotional words: none
* cultural background: western (birthday party is a common celebration in western cultures)

### analysis:

the cue that stands out is the use of irony, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm. the phrase ""you'd better act surprised"" is likely meant to be humorous and mocking, rather than a genuine suggestion. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is consistent with sarcastic language.

### extraction of cues:

* keywords: ""excellent"", ""hole""
* topic: the topic appears to be a conversation about a hole dug by joey.
* emotional words: ""excellent"" is an emotional word, but it's not a strong indicator of sarcasm. there are no other emotional words in the text.
* punctuation: the text only contains a period at the end, which is not unusual for a normal sentence.
* common knowledge: there is no common knowledge explicitly mentioned in the text.

### analysis:

the keyword ""excellent"" is a positive adjective, which might suggest that chandler is being genuine. however, the topic of the conversation is a hole dug by joey, which might be a mundane or even ridiculous thing to be excited about. this could be a setup for sarcasm.

the punctuation is normal, and there are no other emotional words that would indicate sarcasm.

given the context and the conversation, i would assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the label is based on the assumption that chandler is being sarcastic about the hole, implying that it's not actually an excellent hole, but rather a mediocre or even terrible one.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* punctuation: the sentence ends with a period (.) which is a neutral punctuation mark, not indicating strong emotions or irony.
* context: chandler's previous statement was about joey digging a hole, and joey's enthusiasm suggests that chandler might be being sarcastic.
* cultural background: american culture, where sarcasm is a common form of humor.
* emotional contrasts: the surface emotion of the sentence is positive (""excellent""), but the context and tone suggest that chandler might be being ironic or sarcastic.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion of the sentence is positive (praise).

### label:
sarcastic

reasoning: although the sentence starts with a positive adjective (""excellent""), the context and tone suggest that chandler is being sarcastic. the hole joey dug is likely not impressive or excellent, and chandler's comment is likely meant to be ironic or mocking.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

**language style:**
the language style is informal, with a casual tone, which is typical of a conversation between friends.

**rhetorical devices:**
there is no explicit use of rhetorical devices such as metaphors, similes, allusions, etc.

**keywords:**
the keywords are ""excellent hole"" which seems to be a positive comment.

**emotional words:**
the emotional words are ""excellent"" which implies a positive sentiment.

**punctuation:**
the punctuation used is a period (.) which indicates a simple statement.

**surface emotion:** positive (phoebe is expressing enthusiasm and enjoyment)

**keywords:** ""really"", ""really"", ""enjoyed"", ""exotic""

**common knowledge:** phoebe's previous statement was about a baby, but this statement seems unrelated, which might indicate sarcasm.

**label:** **sarcastic**

reasoning: phoebe's over-the-top enthusiasm and use of the word ""really"" twice might be an attempt to hide her true feelings, which could be negative. the fact that her previous statement was unrelated to food or a restaurant experience adds to the suspicion of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i will extract the cues to classify the sarcasm:

**emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""i really, really enjoyed it"" is a strong expression of enthusiasm, but the tone is not congruent with the expected emotions of enjoying something. the word ""exotic"" could be a positive adjective, but the overall tone is not enthusiastic.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be one of enjoyment or appreciation.

**topic:** the topic is likely a food, event, or experience that phoebe is describing.

**language style:** the language style is informal and conversational, with a touch of hyperbole (""really, really enjoyed it"").

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely american, given the context of the tv show friends.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the phrase ""i really, really enjoyed it"" is likely meant to be ironic, as phoebe is not genuinely enthusiastic about the experience.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* cultural background: the phrase ""very exotic"" might suggest a cultural background that is familiar with exotic or unusual things, possibly indicating a humorous or ironic tone.
* special symbols: none

* language style: the language style is casual and conversational, with a hint of exaggeration (""i really, really enjoyed it"").

**label:** **sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because joey's response is evasive and doesn't directly answer chandler's question. the use of ""when?"" and ""today?"" suggests that chandler is trying to get a specific answer, but joey's response ""when? today? some, not a lot"" is ambiguous and slightly dismissive, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

* **topic:** the topic is meeting someone or getting to know someone.

**keywords:** cheesecake, date, eligible straight men

**special symbols:** none

let's extract the cues from the input text to classify it as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

**emotional contrasts:** the input text has a contrast between the person's request for a slice of cheesecake and a date, which is an unusual combination. this contrast suggests that the person is being sarcastic.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with colloquial expressions like ""given' 'em out"", which is typical of casual conversations. however, the tone of the language is also slightly mocking, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.

**emotional words:** the input text does not contain any overtly emotional words, but the tone of the language is playful and ironic, which can be an indicator of sarcasm.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is american, as the conversation is set in a coffee shop in the united states. however, this cue is not directly relevant to the classification of sarcasm.

**rhetorical devices:** the input text uses rhetorical devices like irony and understatement, which are common in sarcastic language. the person is making a humorous comment by asking for a date in addition to cheesecake, implying that they don't actually expect to receive a date.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**.",0,"assistant

here are the extracted cues:

**keywords:**

* ""date""
* ""given' out""

**common knowledge:**

* in the context of the conversation, it's likely that rachel is trying to set monica up with pete, and monica is trying to get pete's attention.

**topic:**

* setting up a date or relationship

**surface emotion:**

* playful or lighthearted tone, possibly with a hint of sarcasm

**special symbols:**

### response:
the response is: 'sarcastic'

### explanation:

* cultural background: the conversation is between friends, likely in a casual setting, which is a common cultural background for sarcasm.
* common knowledge: the context of the conversation implies that phoebe is being sarcastic because monica's previous response was overly enthusiastic and obvious.
* language style: phoebe's response uses a dry tone and understatement (""stating the obvious, but thank you"") which is a common language style for sarcasm.
* punctuation: the use of a comma after ""obvious"" and the absence of any other punctuation marks suggests a conversational tone, which is typical of sarcasm.
* emotional words: the word ""weird"" is used, which is an emotional word that can be used to express sarcasm.
* label: based on the above cues, the label is 'sarcastic'.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i would classify the text as:

**sarcastic**

here's why:

* **punctuation**: the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence (""and it's not weird is it."") is a common way to convey sarcasm.
* **emotional contrasts**: the phrase ""stating the obvious"" implies that the statement is not actually obvious, and the tone is ironic. the phrase ""and it's not weird is it"" is also a way of implying that it is weird, which is the opposite of what the words say.
* **language style**: the use of a somewhat formal tone (""stating the obvious"") and the use of a rhetorical question (""and it's not weird is it"") are both characteristic of sarcastic language.
* **topic**: the topic of the conversation is about monica's reaction to phoebe's comment, which is a lighthearted and playful topic, making it more likely that the tone is sarcastic.
* **common knowledge**: the phrase ""stating the obvious"" implies that the speaker is being sarcastic because the statement is not actually obvious.

overall, the cues suggest that phoebe's response is intended to be humorous and ironic, and the label ""sarcastic"" is the most fitting.",1,"assistant

here are the cues extracted from the input text:

* **surface emotion**: the surface emotion expressed by phoebe is one of politeness and gratitude, but with a hint of sarcasm.
* **common knowledge**: it's common knowledge that it's not weird to express gratitude when someone compliments you.
* **emotional words**: the emotional word used is ""thank you"", which is a polite expression of gratitude.
* **context**: the context is a conversation between friends, where phoebe is responding to monica's compliment.
* **emotional contrasts**: the emotional contrast is between the polite and grateful tone of ""thank you"" and the slightly sarcastic tone of ""stating the obvious, but thank you"", which implies that the compliment was expected or obvious.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,1

### cues:

* **emotional words:** none
* **punctuation:** the input text only contains periods, which are not typically associated with sarcasm.
* **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""i don't think so joe"" is a polite way of saying ""no"", but it's not a rhetorical device that is typically used to convey sarcasm.
* **emotional contrasts:** there are no obvious emotional contrasts in the input text.

### response:

based on the cues, i would classify the input text as:

**not sarcastic**

the phrase ""i don't think so joe"" is a straightforward and polite way of declining joey's request, without any hint of irony or sarcasm.",0,"assistant

### cues:

* rhetorical devices: the use of a simple and direct response (""yeah, i don't think so joe."") without any embellishment or emotional appeal suggests a sarcastic tone.
* surface emotion: the tone of the response is neutral and matter-of-fact, but the words ""i don't think so"" have a slightly dismissive tone that implies rachel is not interested in helping joey.
* topic: the topic is joey's request for a shirt, and rachel's response is related to that.
* common knowledge: the conversation is taking place in a casual setting, and the characters are friends, which is common knowledge.
* special symbols: none.

### label: sarcastic",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* **cultural background:** american, likely from a tv show or movie (e.g., friends)
* **topic:** clothing, specifically a shirt with sauce stains
* **rhetorical devices:**
	+ none explicitly present, but the tone and response can be interpreted as sarcastic
* **keywords:** ""yeah, i don't think so joe""
* **context:** the conversation is taking place between two friends, joey and rachel, in a casual setting, likely at home or in a coffee shop

### analysis:

the response ""yeah, i don't think so joe"" can be interpreted as sarcastic because it's a straightforward and obvious answer, but rachel is responding in a way that's slightly dismissive and unhelpful. the tone is not overtly aggressive or hostile, but it's not entirely helpful either. the use of ""yeah"" at the beginning of the sentence can also be seen as a hint of sarcasm, as it's a common way to soften the blow of a negative response.

### extracted cues:

* keywords: ""so to sum up"", ""i'm professor geller"" (note: the keywords seem to be a summary statement, which is a common way to conclude a conversation)
* context: the conversation is an introduction, and ross is reiterating his identity as professor geller (note: the context is a formal introduction, which is an unusual way to introduce oneself)

* punctuation: the sentence is structured with a simple declarative sentence, with a period at the end
* topic: the topic is ross introducing himself as professor geller

### label:
based on the cues, i would classify the input text as:
**sarcastic**

the keywords ""so to sum up"" and the context of the conversation suggest that ross is being overly formal and redundant in his introduction. the use of a simple declarative sentence with a period at the end adds to the sense of dryness and lack of enthusiasm. the topic of introducing oneself as professor geller is also unusual, which adds to the sense of sarcasm.",1,0

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* cultural background: american, based on the dialogue and character names (ross and rachel from the tv show friends)
* punctuation: the input text only contains punctuation marks at the end of sentences (periods).
* special symbols: none
* keywords: ""married"", ""forever"", which are relevant to the topic of the conversation
* topic: marriage and the possibility of staying married forever

considering these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the tone of the conversation is informal, and rachel's question is likely meant to be ironic or mocking, rather than genuinely curious.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, here's the analysis:

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be surprise or skepticism, as rachel's response is marked by a series of hesitant and questioning words (""what-wh-what"").

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely western, given the use of english and the familiarity with the concept of marriage.

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge is that marriage is typically a lifelong commitment, and the idea of staying married ""forever"" is a common expectation.

**context:** the context is a conversation between ross and rachel, and they are discussing their marriage. ross's previous statement implies that they are considering staying married, which is what rachel is responding to.

**punctuation:** the punctuation in the input text is mostly composed of dashes and question marks, which suggests a sense of hesitation and questioning.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. rachel's response is likely sarcastic because she is expressing skepticism and surprise at the idea of staying married ""forever"", which is an unconventional and perhaps unrealistic expectation.",1,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

**language style:**

* informal tone (use of ""what-wh-what"")
* conversational language
* simple sentence structure

**emotional contrasts:**

* the speaker's tone is casual and matter-of-fact, which contrasts with the dramatic and exaggerated language used by ross earlier (""wow! this is so amazing."")

**rhetorical devices:**

* none notable

**keywords:**

* ""stay married forever""

**emotional words:**

* ""amazing"" (used by ross, but in a sarcastic tone)
* ""forever"" (implies a sense of permanence and commitment)

**analysis:**

the input text is likely sarcastic because rachel's response is a direct quote of ross's earlier statement, but with a tone that is opposite of what ross intended. ross's statement was enthusiastic, but rachel's response is incredulous and questioning, implying that she doesn't believe ross's words. the use of informal language and the dramatic tone also suggest a sarcastic tone.

### cues extraction:

* **punctuation**: the input text does not contain any punctuation marks that could indicate sarcasm.
* **surface emotion**: the surface emotion expressed in the input text is neutral, as ross is simply stating what he thinks the girls might be doing without any apparent emotional tone.
* **rhetorical devices**: there are no obvious rhetorical devices used in the input text that could indicate sarcasm.
* **topic**: the topic of the conversation is a girls' night out.
* **common knowledge**: the conversation is taking place in a tv show (friends), and the characters' personalities and behaviors are well-known. ross is often portrayed as a bit awkward and hesitant, which could be a cue for sarcasm.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the phrase ""something girlie"" seems to be a playful and ironic way for ross to respond to phoebe's question, implying that he doesn't really know what the girls are doing but is making a lighthearted comment about it being something stereotypically ""girlie"".",1,"assistant

### cues:

* **context**: the conversation is between friends, specifically ross and phoebe, and they are discussing a girls' night out. the tone is casual and playful.
* **special symbols**: none
* **language style**: the language used is informal and conversational.
* **rhetorical devices**: none
* **topic**: the topic of the conversation is a girls' night out.

### classification:

based on the cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text.

the reason is that ross's response ""i don't know, something girlie"" is likely sarcastic, as he is downplaying the idea of a girls' night out and implying that it's not something he's interested in. the tone and language used suggest a hint of sarcasm, which is consistent with the label ""sarcastic"".",1,"assistant

### context:
the conversation is between two friends, ross and phoebe, in a tv show. they are discussing a girls' night out.

### special symbols:
none

### keywords:
girlie, girls' night out

### punctuation:
period (.) at the end of the sentence

### cultural background:
the conversation is set in a western culture, likely in the united states, given the references to a ""girls' night out"" and the casual tone of the dialogue.

### analysis:
the tone of ross's statement ""i don't know, something girlie"" is likely sarcastic. the use of the word ""girlie"" is often used to convey a sense of disdain or annoyance, especially in a male-dominated context. additionally, the fact that ross is agreeing to go on a ""girls' night out"" earlier in the conversation, but then downplays the idea by saying it's ""something girlie"", suggests that he is being sarcastic.

* common knowledge: porsche is a luxury car brand, and people may have a general interest in cars
* punctuation: the sentence ends with an exclamation mark, which can indicate strong emotions or emphasis
* emotional words: ""love"", ""ya"" (informal way of saying ""you"", which can convey a sense of familiarity and friendliness)

### label:
sarcastic

the sentence is likely sarcastic because the person is saying they ""just tucked her in"", which implies that the porsche is a woman and is being put to bed, which is an absurd and playful way to refer to a car. the tone is lighthearted and humorous, and the use of informal language and the exclamation mark at the end suggests that the speaker is being playful and tongue-in-cheek.",1,"assistant

### extracted cues:

* rhetorical devices:
	+ idiom: ""tucked her in"" (a common idiomatic expression meaning to put something away, but in this context, it's used to refer to a car)
* cultural background:
	+ american culture (the use of the phrase ""tucked her in"" and the reference to a porsche)
* keywords:
	+ ""show ya"" (implying a desire to show something)
	+ ""tucked her in"" (referencing the car)
* emotional contrasts:

* common knowledge: the context is a conversation about a romantic relationship, which is a common theme in everyday conversations.
* special symbols: none
* surface emotion: the text expresses a negative emotion, specifically apology and hesitation.
* rhetorical devices: the text uses a rhetorical device called ""apology"" to soften the tone and make the message more palatable.

based on these cues, i assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the apology and hesitation expressed in the text may be a way for ross to sugarcoat his true feelings, which could be interpreted as sarcastic.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the text as follows:

**common knowledge:** none specific to the conversation, but general knowledge of relationships and vacations.

**cultural background:** western, likely american, due to the context of a spring vacation and the conversation style.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be apologetic and hesitant.

**rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""i just don't think"" is a rhetorical device used to express a gentle, non-confrontational opinion.

**emotional words:** ""sorry"", ""don't want"", ""pressure"", which convey a sense of caution and consideration.

considering these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the text is likely sarcastic because of the apologetic tone and the use of rhetorical devices to soften the message. the emotional words also suggest a tone that is more cautious than enthusiastic. the phrase ""i'm sorry i just don't think we should go away together yet"" is a polite way of saying ""no"" to a potential romantic getaway, which is a common sarcastic tactic.",1,"assistant

* cultural background: american, based on the dialogue and context
* punctuation: none, which is typical for spoken dialogue
* rhetorical devices: hesitation and caution (""i just don't think"") to soften the tone
* topic: relationship and intimacy

i assign a label of: **sarcastic**

the tone of the statement is polite and hesitant, but the words ""i just don't think"" and the overall context suggest that ross is trying to avoid something, possibly intimacy or commitment. the phrase ""yet"" at the end also implies a sense of caution, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,1

* **common knowledge**: it is common knowledge that removing a linen strip from a mattress can be painful.
* **surface emotion**: monica's response (""ow!!!!! ow-oh-oh!"") suggests that she is experiencing pain or discomfort.
* **context**: the conversation is about removing a linen strip from a mattress, and monica has just experienced pain while doing so.
* **special symbols**: none

### assignment of label:

based on the cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to phoebe's input ""was it not pain-free?"".

the sarcastic tone is evident in the question, as phoebe is implying that monica's experience was not pain-free, despite her initial claim that it was. the tone is also playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is consistent with the sarcastic label.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* special symbols: none
* rhetorical devices:
	+ irony (in the question ""was it not pain-free?"", the speaker is implying that it was indeed painful)
	+ incongruity (the expected answer to the question is ""yes, it was pain-free"", but the previous conversation shows that it was not)
* cultural background: western, likely american (based on the tv show ""friends"")
* context: the conversation is about removing a bandage or strip, and monica previously mentioned that it was painful
* common knowledge: removing a bandage or strip can be painful, especially if it's stuck to the skin

### response:
the response is likely to be a sarcastic remark, such as ""oh, no, it was totally pain-free"" or ""wow, i'm so glad i didn't feel a thing"".

### label: 'sarcastic'",1,"assistant

### extracted cues:

* **keywords:** ""pain-free"", ""ow"", ""ow-oh-oh"" (indicate a negative emotional experience)
* **surface emotion:** frustration, annoyance (monica's reaction)
* **cultural background:** none relevant to this conversation
* **emotional contrasts:** monica's initial optimism (""did that!"") contrasted with her subsequent pain and frustration, while phoebe's neutral tone (""was it not pain-free?"") contrasts with monica's emotional response
* **context:** the conversation is about trying to remove a linen strip, and monica's pain and frustration suggest that the process was not as easy or pain-free as phoebe initially claimed

### response:

phoebe: (smirking or with a hint of sarcasm) ah, no?

### label: **sarcastic**

phoebe's response is likely sarcastic because she's asking a question that's already implied by monica's reaction, and the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek. the use of ""ah, no?"" at the end also suggests a hint of sarcasm, as if phoebe is implying that monica's experience was exactly what she expected.",1,1

### cues:

* special symbols: none
* surface emotion: monica's response seems to convey a negative emotion, possibly frustration or annoyance.
* keywords: ""no!"" is a strong and direct negation.
* punctuation: the exclamation mark at the end of ""no!"" adds emphasis to the response.
* context: the context is a playful and lighthearted conversation, with ross trying to get monica to sing along to a song.

### response:

* monica: no!

### label:

* 'sarcastic'

the label is 'sarcastic' because monica's response is an unexpected and strong negation, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the context and the surface emotion also suggest that monica is not genuinely expressing a refusal to sing, but rather is being playful and ironic.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

* punctuation: the input text contains a single word ""no!"" which ends with an exclamation mark (!). this punctuation mark is often used to convey strong emotions or emphasis, which is a common feature of sarcastic language.
* topic: the topic of the conversation appears to be a song, as ross mentions singing along. monica's response ""no!"" seems to be a reaction to this topic.
* special symbols: none
* emotional contrasts: the contrast between ross's enthusiastic and inviting tone (""one, two, three, four! you know the song! sing along!"") and monica's abrupt and negative response (""no!"") suggests that monica is not interested in singing along, which is an emotional contrast.
* rhetorical devices: none

based on these cues, i would assign the label ""sarcastic"" to the input text. monica's response ""no!"" is a clear rejection of ross's invitation, and the use of the exclamation mark (!) adds emphasis to her negative response. the emotional contrast between ross's enthusiasm and monica's rejection also suggests that monica's response is sarcastic.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* **cultural background:** the reference to the song ""one, two, three, four"" suggests a western cultural background, possibly american.
* **punctuation:** the input text only contains a single word ""no!"" with an exclamation mark, which indicates strong negation and possibly a hint of surprise or annoyance.
* **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""you know the song! sing along!"" is an example of an imperative rhetorical device, encouraging the listener to participate. monica's response ""no!"" can be seen as a form of negation, countering ross's suggestion.
* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the input text is likely negation or refusal, as monica is declining ross's invitation to sing along.
* **emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between ross's enthusiastic and encouraging tone and monica's sudden and firm refusal, which could suggest a sense of sarcasm.

### label:
based on these cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the sudden and firm refusal, combined with the contrast between ross's enthusiasm and monica's response, suggests that monica is using sarcasm to express her annoyance or frustration with ross's suggestion.",1,1

### extraction of cues:

#### context:
the context is a conversation between joey and phoebe, where joey is apologizing for his previous behavior and asking phoebe to be his teacher again.

#### topic:
the topic is joey's apology and request to phoebe to be his teacher again.

#### cultural background:
the cultural background appears to be american, as the characters are likely from the tv show ""friends"".

#### special symbols:
there are no special symbols in the input text.

#### emotional contrasts:
the emotional contrast is between joey's apologetic and sincere tone and phoebe's seemingly dismissive and non-committal response (""uh-huh!"").

### assignment of label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label as: **sarcastic**

the reason is that phoebe's response ""uh-huh!"" is a very brief and non-committal response, which may be interpreted as sarcastic or dismissive. the tone of the response does not match the sincerity and apologetic tone of joey's request, suggesting that phoebe may not be taking joey's apology seriously.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* topic: the topic is joey's apology and request for phoebe to be his teacher again.
* punctuation: the input text contains an exclamation mark (!) which is often used to convey strong emotions, such as excitement or emphasis.
* common knowledge: there is no common knowledge relevant to this conversation.
* rhetorical devices: the input text contains a rhetorical question (""you really think i'm ready?""), which is a common device used to seek agreement or confirmation.
* context: the context is a conversation between joey and phoebe, where joey is apologizing and asking for phoebe's help.

### classification:

based on the cues extracted, i would classify the input text as:

**sarcastic**

the use of a simple ""uh-huh!"" in response to joey's apology and request for help suggests that phoebe is not taking his apology seriously and may be mocking him. the tone of the response is dismissive and unenthusiastic, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

**language style:**
the language used is informal, with a conversational tone, using colloquial expressions like ""uh-huh!"" and contractions like ""i wanna"".

**emotional contrasts:**
there is a contrast between the emotional tone of the previous speaker (joey, who was apologetic and seeking forgiveness) and the emotional tone of phoebe's response, which is neutral and non-committal.

**surface emotion:**
the surface emotion expressed by phoebe is a lack of emotional response, which can be interpreted as a sign of indifference or disinterest.

**cultural background:**
the cultural background is american, based on the use of informal language and colloquial expressions.

**context:**
the context is a conversation between two friends, joey and phoebe, where joey is seeking forgiveness and phoebe is responding in a neutral manner.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to phoebe's response. the use of a single, brief word ""uh-huh!"" in response to joey's apology and request for forgiveness suggests that phoebe is being sarcastic, implying that she is not interested in joey's apology or willing to forgive him.",1,1

### extraction:

#### context:
the context is a conversation between person and monica, where monica is discussing their differences in reading habits and interests.

#### surface emotion:
the surface emotion expressed by monica is a sense of humility and self-deprecation, as they acknowledge their limitations in reading important books and writing complex poetry.

#### rhetorical devices:
the rhetorical device used by monica is understatement, as they downplay the significance of their interests and reading habits.

#### language style:
the language style used by monica is informal, with colloquial expressions like ""y'know"" and ""stupid stuff"".

#### common knowledge:
the common knowledge is that reading important books and writing complex poetry are often considered prestigious activities, and that people may look down on others who don't engage in these activities.

### response:
the response is not provided, but based on the given context and cues, it's likely that monica's response will be a sarcastic remark.

### label:
based on the cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

### extracted cues:

* rhetorical devices: the phrase ""whoa, whoa, whoa"" is an example of an interjection, which is a rhetorical device used to express strong emotions or emphasis.
* language style: the language used is informal and conversational, which is typical of everyday spoken language.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is surprise or shock.
* topic: the topic is a conversation between two people, likely discussing their reading habits and interests.
* keywords: ""whoa"", ""whoa"", ""whoa"" (repetition emphasizes the emotion)

### analysis:

the use of the interjection ""whoa, whoa, whoa"" and the informal language style suggest that the speaker is expressing strong emotions, in this case, surprise or shock. the topic of the conversation is not particularly important or profound, and the speaker's reaction is more emotional than intellectual. this suggests that the speaker is likely being sarcastic.

the statement ""you and i, we're interfacing"" is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, implying that ross and the person are not actually interfacing, but rather engaging in a conversation. the use of the technical term ""interfacing"" in a non-technical context adds to the comedic effect and suggests that ross is being sarcastic.",1,"assistant

the label is ""sarcastic"" because the language style and tone of the sentence are inconsistent with the playful and lighthearted tone established in the previous conversation. the sentence ""you and i, we're interfacing"" is a dry and technical statement that seems out of place in the conversation, suggesting that ross is being sarcastic or ironic.",1,1

the text is sarcastic because phoebe is saying the opposite of what she means. she's actually not okay with seeing him, but is pretending to be fine to avoid conflict. the use of phrases like ""so now i have to go"" and ""totally ok"" are indicative of sarcasm, as they convey the opposite meaning of what is being said.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**common knowledge**: none

**topic**: the topic is likely the conversation about using a brush and some unknown substance.

**rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""all right"" is a rhetorical device, as it's a common expression used to indicate agreement or confirmation, but in this context, it may be used sarcastically.

**surface emotion**: the surface emotion appears to be neutral or slightly positive, as ross is agreeing to use the brush.

**emotional contrasts**: there is a contrast between the expected positive emotion (e.g., enthusiasm) and the actual neutral tone, which could indicate sarcasm.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the phrase ""all right"" is likely being used to express ross's reluctance or annoyance at using the brush, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* keywords: ""all right"" (a phrase that can be used to express agreement or acceptance, but also has a slightly formal tone that might suggest sarcasm)
* emotional words: none
* punctuation: none
* cultural background: western (assuming the conversation is taking place in a western cultural context)
* topic: none (the conversation seems to be about using a brush, but this cue is not very relevant in this case)

### analysis:

the phrase ""all right"" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted as either a genuine expression of agreement or a sarcastic comment. however, the context of the conversation suggests that ross might be being sarcastic. rachel has already used a brush, and ross's response seems to be a bit hesitant, which could imply that he's not really interested in using it. the tone of the phrase ""all right"" is also slightly formal, which could be a hint of sarcasm.

### label:

i'm going to label this text as ""sarcastic"".",1,"assistant

**cue extraction:**

* **language style:** ross's response is short and curt, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.
* **keywords:** ""all right"" is a phrase that can be used to express agreement, but in this context, it may be used to convey a sense of annoyance or frustration, which is a common theme in sarcastic language.
* **emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between ross's initial enthusiasm (""okay"") and his later response (""all right""), which suggests that his tone may have shifted from positive to negative.
* **context:** the conversation is about using a brush, and ross's response may be a reaction to the situation or the other person's suggestion.
* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed by ross is one of resignation or indifference, but this may be a mask for underlying frustration or annoyance.

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* cultural background: no specific cultural background is mentioned, but the tone and language used are generally western.
* keywords: the keywords are ""mad"", ""angry"", and ""puppies"", which are related to the conversation about phoebe's emotional state.
* emotional contrasts: there is a contrast between phoebe's initial calm tone (""uh-huh, well!"") and her later expression of anger (""i'm-i'm mad at you"").
* emotional words: the emotional words are ""mad"", ""angry"", and ""cute"", which convey a sense of emotional intensity.

based on these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the phrase ""but umm, still i'm-i'm mad at you"" suggests that phoebe is trying to convey a sense of irony or contradiction, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of the phrase ""uh-huh, well!"" at the beginning of the sentence also implies a tone of hesitation or pretence, which is another common feature of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is anger, indicated by the phrase ""i'm-i'm mad at you"".

**emotional contrasts:** the text contains emotional contrasts, as phoebe initially expresses a neutral/curious tone (""uh-huh, well!"") and then shifts to expressing anger (""i'm-i'm mad at you"").

**special symbols:** there are no special symbols in this text.

**topic:** the topic of the conversation is an unresolved issue or conflict between phoebe and the person, which is not specified in detail.

**emotional words:** the text contains emotional words such as ""mad"", which indicates a negative emotional tone.

considering these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the use of emotional contrasts, specifically the shift from a neutral tone to anger, suggests that phoebe is using sarcasm to express her frustration. the phrase ""but umm, still i'm-i'm mad at you"" has a tone of resignation and annoyance, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* **context:** the conversation is about a disagreement or conflict between two people, phoebe and person. phoebe is upset with person.
* **common knowledge:** puppies are often considered cute, and it's a common topic of discussion.
* **rhetorical devices:** there are no obvious rhetorical devices in this input text.
* **topic:** the topic is phoebe's anger towards person.
* **special symbols:** none.

### analysis:

the input text ""uh-huh, well! but umm, still i'm-i'm mad at you"" has a tone that suggests phoebe is trying to calm down or hide her anger, but still expressing it. the use of ""uh-huh"" and ""umm"" can be seen as filler words or hesitation, which might indicate that phoebe is trying to be polite or composed while still being upset. the phrase ""still i'm-i'm mad at you"" explicitly states phoebe's anger, but in a way that's not overtly aggressive or confrontational.

### label:

based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to this input text. the tone and language used by phoebe suggest that she is trying to hide her anger, but still expressing it in a subtle way, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.",1,1

based on the cues extracted, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the use of ""okay"" at the beginning, the rhetorical question, and the playful tone all suggest that chandler is being sarcastic in his response.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**emotional contrasts:** the conversation starts with a playful and lighthearted tone, with ross making a joke about chandler being predictable. however, chandler's response is more surprised and skeptical. this contrast in emotions suggests that chandler might be using sarcasm to respond.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the input text appears to be playful and teasing, as chandler is poking fun at ross's claim of being ""always aware"" and ross's use of a japanese concept (unagi) in a non-technical context.

**punctuation:** the punctuation used is mostly standard, with no unusual or exaggerated punctuation that would indicate sarcasm.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely american, given the context of the conversation and the use of colloquial expressions (e.g., ""what?!"" and ""okay"").

**context:** the context is a humorous conversation between friends, which is typical of the show friends.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the input text is likely sarcastic because chandler is using irony and understatement to respond to ross's claim, implying that ross is not actually ""always aware"" of everything. the tone is playful and teasing, but the language is also clever and ironic, which is characteristic of sarcastic speech.",1,"assistant

### cues extraction:

* **emotional contrasts:** the conversation is light-hearted and playful, with a sudden shift in tone when chandler responds. the contrast between ross's serious tone and chandler's sarcastic response creates an emotional contrast.
* **common knowledge:** the topic of ""unagi"" is a japanese concept referring to a state of awareness or enlightenment. the audience is expected to have some basic knowledge of this concept.
* **topic:** the topic is ross's claim of being aware of everything, which is challenged by chandler's response.
* **context:** the conversation is a humorous exchange between friends, with a playful and teasing tone.
* **emotional words:** ""okay"", ""aware"", ""eel"" (these words don't necessarily convey strong emotions, but the tone and context suggest a playful and sarcastic intent)

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**punctuation:** the sentence ends with a period (.), which is a neutral punctuation mark.

**emotional contrasts:** the text expresses a contrast between phoebe's statement (""i don't think you could ever do that"") and the assumption that joey might wear women's underwear, which is an unexpected and humorous twist.

**rhetorical devices:** the sentence uses a rhetorical question, which is a common device used in sarcasm. the question is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to convey phoebe's skepticism and ridicule towards joey's potential behavior.

**context:** the conversation is about joey's appearance and behavior, and phoebe's statement is in response to joey's comment about jake. the context suggests that phoebe is teasing joey and implying that he is not masculine enough to wear women's underwear.

**common knowledge:** there is no specific common knowledge required to understand the text, but the conversation assumes that the listener is familiar with the concept of masculinity and the idea that men typically do not wear women's underwear.

considering these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

### cues:

* **context**: the conversation is about jake wearing pink lacys, which is an unconventional and potentially embarrassing situation. phoebe is defending jake's masculinity, and joey is making fun of him.
* **rhetorical devices**: phoebe is using irony and exaggeration to emphasize her point. she says jake is ""all man"" and even more masculine than joey, which is an obvious exaggeration.
* **common knowledge**: the topic of masculinity and femininity is a common area of discussion, and the idea that some men might feel insecure about wearing women's clothing is a common understanding.
* **language style**: phoebe's language is informal and conversational, with a touch of playfulness and humor.
* **topic**: the topic is still jake's masculinity and his unconventional fashion choice.

### response:

phoebe: i don't think you could ever do that.

### label:

**sarcastic**

phoebe's statement is likely sarcastic because she is implying that joey, who is already making fun of jake, would never be able to wear women's underwear. the tone is playful and humorous, but also slightly mocking, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

i'll extract the cues from the input text to classify it as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

**emotional contrasts:** the tone of the text is calm and polite, which contrasts with the emergency situation described in the context. this suggests that the speaker might be being sarcastic.

**context:** the context is a medical emergency, which adds to the unexpectedness of the speaker's request.

**punctuation:** the text uses polite language, with phrases like ""please, please don't go anywhere, okay?"" which is unusual in an emergency situation.

**special symbols:** none.

**topic:** the topic is a medical emergency, which is an unexpected situation for a polite request.

considering these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",0,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the label as follows:

### cues:

* context: the context is an emergency situation where someone is choking, and the speaker (person1) is trying to prevent the other person (person2) from leaving the scene.
* emotional words: none explicitly mentioned, but the situation is emotionally charged.
* common knowledge: the common knowledge is that choking is a serious situation that requires immediate attention.
* emotional contrasts: the speaker's tone is likely to be anxious or worried, but there is no explicit contrast in emotions.
* language style: the language used is simple and direct, with a sense of urgency.

### label:
based on the cues, i assign the label as 'sarcastic'. the speaker's request ""please, please don't go anywhere, okay?"" is likely to be ironic, as the situation is an emergency, and it's unlikely that person2 would want to leave. the tone is likely to be tongue-in-cheek, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

**context:** the context is an emergency situation where someone is choking on their retainer, and someone (person1) is trying to persuade someone else (bernice) not to leave.

**emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the urgency of the situation (""emergency"") and the request to not leave (""please, please don't go anywhere, okay?"") suggests that person1 is trying to downplay the importance of the situation, which is an emotional contrast.

**common knowledge:** there is no specific common knowledge that can be extracted from this input text.

**special symbols:** none.

**rhetorical devices:** the use of ""please, please"" and the phrase ""okay?"" can be seen as a rhetorical device to make the request more persuasive and polite.

based on these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the tone of the request is overly polite and exaggerated, suggesting that person1 is being sarcastic and trying to hide their true feelings about the situation.",1,1

**language style:** formal (direct and to-the-point)

**rhetorical devices:** none notable

**surface emotion:** neutral

**punctuation:** proper use of punctuation, no irregularities

**cultural background:** american (based on the context of empire office supplies)

the response is direct and formal, without any hint of irony, understatement, or mocking tone, which are common characteristics of sarcastic language. the tone is neutral and professional, indicating that the person is simply responding to the question.",0,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**emotional contrasts:** there are no explicit emotional contrasts in this short conversation. however, we can infer a subtle contrast between the person's straightforward response (""i'm the supply manager."") and phoebe's earlier sarcastic tone (""oh okay. umm, all right.""). this contrast suggests that phoebe might be being sarcastic again.

**punctuation:** the punctuation used is standard and doesn't provide any clear indication of sarcasm.

**special symbols:** none used.

**keywords:** ""supply manager"" is a key term in the conversation, but it's not a keyword that typically indicates sarcasm.

**context:** the context of the conversation is a phone call, and phoebe is trying to get in touch with the supply manager. this context doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. phoebe's earlier response already hinted at sarcasm, and her tone in this response (""oh okay. umm, all right."") suggests that she might be being facetious again.",1,0

based on the input text, i will extract the cues to classify the sarcasm:

**emotional words:** none

**punctuation:** none

**language style:** informal, conversational tone

**common knowledge:** none

**context:** the conversation appears to be between friends, possibly in a casual setting

from the input text, i can infer that ross is responding to a situation where he is being asked to show something, but instead, he is sarcastically commenting on the appearance of a van. the phrase ""this bitchin van"" is likely meant to be ironic, as ""bitchin"" is a slang term that is often used to express enthusiasm or approval, but in this context, it is being used to express the opposite.

therefore, i assign the label:

**sarcastic**",1,"assistant

**language style:** informal, conversational tone with a dash of colloquialism (use of ""bitchin'"")

**surface emotion:** amusement, possibly playfulness (ross's tone seems lighthearted and teasing)

**topic:** the van that phoebe was showing them

**emotional contrasts:** none apparent, but the tone is playful and non-serious

**rhetorical devices:** none apparent

**label:** **sarcastic**

reasoning: while ross's tone is lighthearted and playful, his comment about the van being ""bitchin'"" is likely meant to be ironic and humorous, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the use of the colloquialism ""bitchin'"" also adds to the sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

### context:
the context is a conversation between friends, likely from the tv show friends. the conversation is lighthearted and playful, with a sense of humor.

the punctuation in the input text is standard, with no unusual or notable punctuation marks.

### special symbols:
there are no special symbols in the input text.

### surface emotion:

i'll extract the cues from the input text to classify the sarcasm.

**punctuation:** there is no punctuation in the input text that stands out as unusual or indicative of sarcasm.

**emotional contrasts:** the input text is a simple question, ""you still love me?"", which doesn't contain any emotional contrasts that would suggest sarcasm.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the question appears to be genuine curiosity or inquiry.

**common knowledge:** there is no common knowledge that is explicitly mentioned in the input text that would help classify the sarcasm.

**context:** the context is a conversation between ross and rachel, where they have a history of relationship issues. this context might suggest that ross is asking the question in a way that is not entirely genuine.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as:

**label:** 'sarcastic'

the question ""you still love me?"" seems unlikely to be a genuine inquiry, given the context of their conversation and ross's previous response. the tone of the question is likely to be sarcastic, implying that ross is not actually interested in rachel's answer.",1,"assistant

**extracted cues:**

* **punctuation:** question mark (?)
* **special symbols:** none
* **rhetorical devices:** irony (assuming ross is asking the question despite knowing rachel's feelings)
* **emotional words:** love
* **context:** the conversation is about ross and rachel's past relationship, and ross is trying to get rachel to admit her feelings for him.

**label:** **sarcastic**

ross's question ""you still love me?"" is likely sarcastic because he knows the answer and is trying to provoke a reaction from rachel. the use of irony and the emotional words ""love"" suggest that ross is being sarcastic, rather than genuinely curious about rachel's feelings.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* emotional words:
	+ ""love"" (a strong emotional word)
* rhetorical devices:
	+ none explicitly present
* punctuation:
	+ none notable
* cultural background:
	+ western, likely american (based on the context of the conversation)
* common knowledge:
	+ the conversation is taking place between ross and rachel, who are likely in a romantic relationship (based on the context)

### analysis:

the input text ""you still love me?"" is a question that is likely intended to be rhetorical, as ross is trying to provoke a reaction from rachel. the use of the emotional word ""love"" suggests that ross is trying to appeal to rachel's emotions and get her to admit that she still has feelings for him. the question itself is a common technique used in romantic relationships to test the other person's feelings.

### label:

based on the cues extracted, i would label the input text as **sarcastic**. the question is likely intended to be sarcastic, as ross is trying to manipulate rachel's emotions and get a reaction out of her. the tone of the question is likely playful and teasing, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,1

to classify the sarcasm level of the input text, i will extract the following cues:

**emotional words:** ""happy"" (positive emotion)

**language style:** the tone is casual and conversational, which is common in everyday speech. however, the phrase ""i'm so happy for them!"" is an exaggerated expression, which could be a hint of sarcasm.

**context:** the conversation is about two best friends falling in love, which is an unlikely scenario. this context suggests that the speaker might be being sarcastic.

**keywords:** ""happy"" (a positive emotion that might be ironic in this context)

**special symbols:** none

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the phrase ""i'm so happy for them!"" is an exaggerated expression that is likely to be ironic, given the unlikely scenario of two best friends falling in love.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i extract the following cues:

* rhetorical devices: none
* emotional words: ""happy""
* keywords: ""happy"", ""them"" (referring to the two best friends)
* punctuation: exclamation mark (!) which is often used to convey strong emotions
* emotional contrasts: none

considering these cues, i would assign a label of ""not sarcastic"" to the input text. the use of the word ""happy"" and the exclamation mark suggests that rachel is genuinely expressing her emotions, rather than using sarcasm.",0,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* **context:** the conversation is between two best friends, phoebe and rachel, discussing a situation where they are falling in love. this context suggests a strong emotional bond between the speakers, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic conversations.
* **emotional contrasts:** the emotional tone of the conversation is complex, with phoebe expressing skepticism and rachel expressing happiness. this contrast in emotions creates an opportunity for sarcasm.
* **punctuation:** the input text only contains one sentence, ""no! i'm so happy for them!"", which is a short and straightforward sentence. the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence suggests strong emotions, but it's not enough to indicate sarcasm on its own.
* **keywords:** the keyword ""happy"" is used, which is an emotion that is typically associated with positivity. however, the context and emotional contrast suggest that rachel's happiness might be ironic or insincere.
* **special symbols:** there are no special symbols in the input text that would indicate sarcasm.

### label:

based on the extraction of cues, i would assign the label **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the context and emotional contrast suggest that rachel's happiness might be ironic or insincere, and the keyword ""happy"" could be used to convey the opposite emotion.",1,1

considering these cues, i would assign a label of:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the speaker is not entirely sincere, as the apology is being made over the phone and the speaker is not taking full responsibility for their actions. the use of ""but i'm"" and the pause before the apology also suggest a tone of insincerity or hesitation.",1,"assistant

### topic:
the topic is a personal apology and a past mistake.

### surface emotion:
the surface emotion is regret and guilt.

### cultural background:
the cultural background is likely american, given the reference to a specific tv show (friends) and the informal tone.

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**emotional words:**

* ""just"" (can be used to express frustration or annoyance)
* ""okay"" (can be used to express skepticism or hesitation)

**surface emotion:**

* frustration or annoyance (based on the context of the conversation and chandler's previous sarcastic comment)

**punctuation:**

* the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence (""is it okay if they come visit?"") can indicate a rhetorical question, which is often used in sarcastic language.

**common knowledge:**

* the fact that chandler is trying to delay or avoid going to meet monica's parents, which is a common theme in the show friends.

**keywords:**

* ""just"" (repeats the word ""just"" to emphasize his point)
* ""okay"" (used to express skepticism or hesitation)
* ""come visit"" (used to make a seemingly innocent request, but with a sarcastic tone)

based on these cues, i would assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the sentence is sarcastic because chandler is using a seemingly innocent question to express his frustration and annoyance at being forced to go to meet monica's parents. the use of rhetorical questions, repetition of words, and the common knowledge of chandler's reluctance to go to the meeting all point to a sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

* punctuation: the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence ""just look at them i mean, is it okay if they come visit?"" suggests a rhetorical question, which is a common feature of sarcastic language.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the text is curiosity or inquiry, but the tone is likely sarcastic.
* language style: the language style is informal and conversational, which is consistent with the dialogue style of the tv show friends.

based on these cues, i assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text.",1,"assistant

i can do that!

### rhetorical devices:
* irony (specifically, verbal irony): chandler's statement ""just look at them i mean, is it okay if they come visit?"" is an ironic way of asking if his friends can come over, as he is trying to hide the fact that he is actually asking if his friends can come over.

### common knowledge:
* chandler is known for his sarcasm and wit in the tv show friends.

### context:
* the conversation is taking place in a hurry, as they need to meet monica's parents in 15 minutes, which adds to the sense of urgency and sets the tone for chandler's sarcastic comment.

### extraction of cues:

#### context:
the context is a conversation between friends, monica and chandler, about a shirt monica bought.

#### rhetorical devices:
- the phrase ""one of the lifeguards"" is an exaggeration, as it's unlikely that a lifeguard would be dismantling a nuclear device.

#### special symbols:
none.

#### common knowledge:
- lifeguards are typically responsible for ensuring the safety of people at swimming pools or beaches.
- nuclear devices are highly sensitive and dangerous, and it's unlikely that a lifeguard would be handling one.

#### emotional words:
- ""anyway"" (a transition word) doesn't convey a specific emotion, but the tone is casual and conversational.
- ""should go"" (implying a sense of urgency) and ""dismantle a nuclear device"" (conveying a sense of danger and alarm) create a tone that is somewhat playful and humorous.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the phrase ""one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device"" is an obvious exaggeration and is likely meant to be humorous, rather than taken literally. the tone is playful and lighthearted, and the use of a ridiculous scenario is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

### context:
the context is a conversation between friends, monica and chandler, where they are discussing a shirt monica bought for chandler.

### input:
chandler: anyway, i should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.

### response:
none

### cues:

* context: conversational tone, friends discussing a mundane topic (shirt)
* rhetorical devices: hyperbole (dismantling a nuclear device), absurdity
* emotional words: none
* special symbols: none
* language style: casual, conversational tone with a hint of absurdity

### label:
sarcastic",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the label as follows:

**emotional words:** none

**cultural background:** none

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the statement ""one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device"" is an exaggeration and an unexpected statement, which creates an emotional contrast with the typical conversation about a t-shirt.

**context:** the conversation started with chandler expressing excitement about a t-shirt, and then suddenly shifts to a seemingly unrelated and absurd statement about a lifeguard dismantling a nuclear device.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of the statement is clearly sarcastic, as it is an obvious exaggeration and not meant to be taken literally. the use of an unexpected and absurd scenario is a common technique used in sarcasm to convey irony or mocking.",1,1

### label:
sarcastic

based on the instruction, i will extract the cues from the input text to classify it as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

**common knowledge:** none relevant to the statement

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be positive, as the phrase ""you're a hero"" typically conveys admiration and praise.

**emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the expected positive emotion and the actual sarcastic tone is a key cue.

**context:** the input text is a standalone statement, so there is no external context to consider.

**rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""twenty-one hours, you're a hero"" is an example of understatement, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm.

given these cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the phrase ""you're a hero"" is an obvious exaggeration, and the tone is likely ironic, implying the opposite of what is being said.",0,"assistant

based on the given input text, i'll extract the following cues:

**emotional words:** none explicitly, but the tone is sarcastic.

**language style:** the sentence is concise and has a sudden shift in tone, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

**rhetorical devices:** the sentence uses irony, as the speaker is not genuinely praising someone for being a hero after only 21 hours.

**topic:** the topic is unclear, but it seems to be a general statement rather than a specific topic.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion is admiration or praise, but it's likely intended to be ironic and sarcastic.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,"assistant

### analysis:

the response ""no, i know, but i,he just went on"" seems to be a defensive and dismissive response to rachel's request. the use of ""no"" and ""but"" suggests a sense of frustration and impatience. the person is not providing a clear explanation or justification for not having a boarding pass, but rather is trying to shift the focus away from the issue.

### label:

based on the extracted cues and analysis, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

**cues:**

* **keywords:** ""just went on"", ""no"", ""but""
* **language style:** blunt and direct, with a hint of annoyance
* **cultural background:** likely from a western culture, where directness is valued
* **context:** a conversation between two airport staff members, rachel and the person, about boarding passes
* **common knowledge:** passengers need to have a boarding pass to access the jetway

**analysis:** the language used by rachel is direct and to the point, indicating a lack of sarcasm. the keywords ""just went on"" and ""no"" are used to convey a sense of frustration, but not in a sarcastic tone. the cultural background and context also suggest a straightforward and efficient communication style.

**label:** **not sarcastic**",0,"assistant

### context:
the context is a conversation between rachel and a person at an airport, with rachel asking for a boarding pass and the person providing an unclear response.

### cultural background:
the cultural background is western, as the conversation is taking place in an airport setting, which is common in western cultures.

### punctuation:
the input text contains a comma (,) and a period (.).

### topic:
the topic is travel and air travel, specifically boarding passes and airport procedures.

### special symbols:
there are no special symbols in the input text.

### analysis:
the input text ""rachel: no, i know, but i,he just went on."" is likely sarcastic because the person is responding to rachel's request for a boarding pass by saying they don't have one, but then immediately implies that they did have one by saying ""he just went on"", which is an unclear and confusing statement. the use of the comma (,) after ""i know"" and the unclear phrase ""he just went on"" suggest that the person is being sarcastic and trying to deflect the conversation.

reasoning: the language style and tone of the input text are consistent with chandler's sarcastic personality from the given context. the question ""okay, now much have you won so far?"" is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, implying that the person hasn't won much at all, rather than a genuine inquiry about their financial success.",1,"assistant

the label is ""sarcastic"" because chandler's response is likely meant to be humorous and ironic. the question ""okay, now much have you won so far?"" is a playful way of asking how much someone has won, but the phrasing is exaggerated and tongue-in-cheek, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

**context:** the conversation is about a wedding gift, and the tone is likely to be emotional and intense.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with strong emotions and a sense of urgency.

**cultural background:** no specific cultural background is mentioned, but the language and tone suggest a western cultural influence.

**emotional contrasts:** the input text exhibits a strong emotional contrast between the calm and polite tone of the person offering the gift and the intense anger and frustration expressed by monica.

**rhetorical devices:** the use of the phrase ""you have been screwing us all day!"" is an example of rhetorical exaggeration, emphasizing monica's feelings of frustration and disappointment.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

**cues:**

* **punctuation:** exclamation mark (!!) at the end of the sentence, indicating strong emotions.
* **common knowledge:** none.
* **keywords:** ""screwing"", ""all day"", which are strong words with negative connotations.
* **surface emotion:** anger.
* **topic:** the hotel's behavior, specifically the person's actions throughout the day.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the sentence is sarcastic because the speaker, monica, is using strong language to express frustration and anger, but the context suggests that she is actually upset about the hotel's offer of the honeymoon suite, which is an unexpected and potentially unwanted gift. the tone is ironic, implying that the speaker is not genuinely grateful for the gift.",1,1

### context:
the context is a conversation between two people, likely friends or acquaintances, where rachel is apologizing for accidentally touching something.

### input:
rachel: i did not mean to touch that, i mean

### cues:

* **language style:** the language used is informal and conversational, with a tone that is apologetic and hesitant.
* **emotional contrasts:** the input text has a contrast between rachel's initial statement (""i did not mean to touch that"") which is a straightforward apology, and the trailing ""i mean"" which suggests that she's trying to clarify or retract her apology.
* **special symbols:** none
* **surface emotion:** the surface emotion is one of apology and embarrassment.

### assignment:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the trailing ""i mean"" suggests that rachel is being ironic or sarcastic, implying that she's not really apologizing or taking responsibility for her actions. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

* cultural background: none explicitly mentioned, but the use of ""i mean"" and the sentence structure suggest a western cultural background.
* rhetorical devices: the use of ""i mean"" is a rhetorical device to clarify or soften the previous statement.
* topic: the topic appears to be apologizing for a minor mistake or accident.
* emotional words: ""i did not mean to"", ""oh god"", ""i'm sorry"" convey a sense of embarrassment, regret, and apology.
* punctuation: the use of commas and the exclamation mark (!) adds to the emotional tone of the sentence.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the use of ""i mean"" and the repetition of ""i'm sorry"" may be interpreted as sarcastic, as if rachel is trying to convey the opposite of what she is saying, i.e., that she did mean to touch it and is not genuinely sorry.",1,1

* language style: the language used is informal and conversational, with a dash of playfulness (e.g., ""pheebs"" instead of ""phoebe"").
* cultural background: the dialogue appears to be from a tv show or movie, likely set in the united states, given the informal language and colloquialisms.
* emotional words: none explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests a potential emotional tone (e.g., concern, awkwardness).
* context: the conversation seems to be taking a sensitive or personal turn, with joey mentioning phoebe's mom, which may indicate a potentially emotional or awkward topic.
* rhetorical devices: none explicitly used, but the context and language suggest a subtle attempt to steer the conversation in a certain direction (e.g., joey's hesitation before bringing up phoebe's mom).

given these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of phoebe's response, ""yeah?"", seems to be a subtle acknowledgment of the potentially sensitive topic, while also maintaining a hint of playfulness and nonchalance, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* **keywords**: ""pheebs"", ""mom"" (common sarcastic phrases)
* **context**: the conversation is between friends, and the topic is phoebe's mom, which might be a sensitive or embarrassing topic for phoebe.
* **emotional contrasts**: the sudden shift from a casual greeting to a potentially uncomfortable topic suggests a contrast in emotions.
* **surface emotion**: phoebe's response seems to be neutral or curious, which could be a mask for underlying emotions.
* **special symbols**: none

### analysis:

given the cues, it's likely that phoebe's response is sarcastic. the keywords and context suggest that the topic of her mom might be a sensitive one, and the emotional contrasts between the friendly greeting and the potentially uncomfortable topic could indicate sarcasm. the surface emotion of phoebe's response seems neutral, which could be a sign of sarcasm. therefore, i would assign the label:

**sarcastic**",1,"assistant

### cues:

* special symbols: none
* cultural background: none
* common knowledge: phoebe's mom is a character in the tv show friends, known for being eccentric and unconventional.
* emotional contrasts: the conversation is starting to take a serious tone, which is a contrast to the initial friendly and casual greeting.
* rhetorical devices: none

### label:
'sarcastic'

the input text implies that phoebe's mom is being discussed, and the tone of the conversation is about to take a serious turn. the use of the phrase ""yeah?"" by phoebe, which is a common response to a question, but also implies a sense of anticipation or wariness, suggests that phoebe is preparing for something potentially unpleasant. the emotional contrast from the initial friendly greeting to a potentially serious topic, and the common knowledge about phoebe's mom, all point to a sarcastic tone in the response.",1,1

**cues:**

* **rhetorical devices:** ross uses sarcasm (""i've had better"") to express his disappointment or frustration with the nap.
* **language style:** the language used is informal and conversational, typical of a casual conversation between friends.
* **context:** the context is a humorous exchange between friends, which suggests that sarcasm is likely to be used.

### cues extraction:

* **rhetorical devices:** irony (ross's statement ""i've had better"" is ironic because he's saying he's had a great nap, but joey is reacting as if he's being serious)
* **topic:** the topic is ross's nap and his claim that it was the best ever.
* **emotional words:** none explicitly stated, but the tone is playful and teasing.
* **punctuation:** the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence (""uh-huh!"") indicates strong emotions, in this case, sarcasm.
* **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between joey's serious reaction (""when?!"") and ross's playful response (""all right! all right! it was the best nap ever!"") suggests that joey is being sarcastic.

* **cultural background:** western, likely american, given the context of the tv show friends
* **common knowledge:** ross is expressing frustration and possibly jealousy towards rachel, who has chosen to go out with another person instead of him.

**label:** **sarcastic**

reasoning: the phrase ""can't do it, can you?"" is a classic example of sarcasm. ross is implying that rachel is somehow incapable of doing something, likely referring to her ability to choose him over the other person. the tone and wording suggest that ross is being facetious and mocking, rather than genuinely asking for her capabilities.",1,"assistant

### cues extracted from the input text:

* special symbols: none
* language style: informal, conversational
* punctuation: question mark (?)
* topic: unwillingness to do something
* surface emotion: curiosity/challenge

### label: sarcastic

the tone of the sentence ""can't do it, can you?"" is sarcastic because it's a rhetorical question implying that the person can indeed do it, but they're choosing not to. the use of the question mark at the end also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's not a genuine inquiry.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

* common knowledge: none
* surface emotion: the surface emotion appears to be a questioning tone, but it's not clear what emotion is being expressed.
* rhetorical devices: the phrase ""can't do it, can you?"" is a rhetorical question, which is often used to make a point or express sarcasm.
* punctuation: the punctuation is simple, with a question mark at the end of the sentence.
* cultural background: american english, as the dialogue appears to be from the tv show friends.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the rhetorical question ""can't do it, can you?"" is likely being used to express sarcasm, as ross is implying that someone else cannot do something, but the tone is actually mocking or belittling.",1,1

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

**context:** the conversation is between two friends, rachel and phoebe, and they are discussing the difficulty of finding rhymes for rachel's name.

**emotional contrasts:** the tone of the conversation shifts from playful and lighthearted (rachel's initial comments) to annoyed and frustrated (phoebe's response).

**keywords:** ""stupid name"" is a keyword that indicates a negative and critical tone.

**special symbols:** none

**language style:** the language used is informal and conversational, with a touch of playfulness in rachel's initial comments, but becomes more sarcastic and biting in phoebe's response.

based on these cues, i assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. phoebe's response is clearly sarcastic, using a critical tone and a hurtful phrase (""stupid name"") to express her frustration.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i assign the label as follows:

**language style:** the language used is informal, conversational, and slightly aggressive, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

**special symbols:** none.

**context:** the context is a conversation between two friends, phoebe and rachel, discussing the difficulty of finding rhyming names. the tone is playful, but the language used by phoebe is slightly aggressive and critical.

**keywords:** ""stupid name"", ""so hard"", ""nothing rhymes"", which convey a sense of frustration and annoyance.

**rhetorical devices:** phoebe's statement contains a rhetorical device called ""ad hominem attack"", where she attacks rachel's name instead of addressing the actual issue, which is the difficulty of finding rhymes.

considering these cues, i classify the input text as:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the conversation is playful, but phoebe's language is laced with sarcasm and aggression, making it clear that she is being sarcastic.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

* cultural background: the conversation appears to be between two friends, rachel and phoebe, and the language used is informal and casual, suggesting a western cultural background.
* emotional words: the emotional words used are ""hard"", ""stupid"", which convey a negative and frustrated tone.
* punctuation: the text contains exclamation marks (!), which indicate strong emotions and emphasis.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion appears to be anger or frustration.
* rhetorical devices: the text contains a rhetorical device, specifically an ad hominem attack (""your stupid name""), which is a common way to express sarcasm.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to the input text. the phrase ""nothing rhymes with your stupid name!"" is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine expression of frustration. the use of the word ""stupid"" and the ad hominem attack are also typical characteristics of sarcastic language.",1,1

* context: phoebe is apologizing and trying to make up to someone, and the tone of the apology seems insincere or half-hearted

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of phoebe's response ""okay?"" seems to imply that she's not really sorry or interested in making amends, and the brevity and lack of enthusiasm suggest a sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

* emotional words: ""sorry"", ""right"", ""enjoy""
* surface emotion: apologetic (phoebe is apologizing for a past mistake)
* topic: the previous incident with roger
* rhetorical devices: none

**label:** 'sarcastic'

the cue that leads me to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' is the sudden shift in tone and the brevity of the response ""okay?"" which is an unexpected and curt response to an apology. the sarcastic tone is implying that phoebe is not genuinely interested in making it up to the person, but is rather going through the motions.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* **context:** the context is a conversation between phoebe and someone else (not specified) about a past incident with roger. phoebe is trying to make amends and offers a gift.
* **language style:** phoebe's language style is informal, with a casual tone and a hint of awkwardness.
* **emotional contrasts:** the emotional contrast is between phoebe's apology and her attempt to make amends, which is genuine, and the recipient's response, which is brief and neutral (""okay?"").
* **cultural background:** the cultural background is not explicitly mentioned, but the conversation seems to be taking place in a western context.
* **emotional words:** the emotional words used are ""sorry"", ""right"", and ""make it up to you"", which convey a sense of remorse and apology.

based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text ""phoebe: okay?"".

the reason is that phoebe's response ""okay?"" is extremely brief and lacks enthusiasm, which is unusual given the context and phoebe's attempt to make amends. the tone is also somewhat flat and unenthusiastic, which suggests that phoebe might be being sarcastic, implying that the gift is not as exciting or appreciated as she had hoped.",1,1

### extracted cues:

* **topic**: the conversation between phoebe and rachel about phoebe's special feeling.
* **emotional contrasts**: phoebe's statement ""being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special"" implies a contrast between feeling special and possibly feeling left out or isolated.
* **surface emotion**: phoebe's surface emotion appears to be one of pride or satisfaction (""it makes me feel special"").
* **context**: the context is a conversation between phoebe and rachel, and phoebe's statement is a response to rachel's reaction to phoebe's previous statement.
* **punctuation**: the input text does not contain any punctuation marks that are particularly relevant to the sarcasm classification.

### analysis:

phoebe's statement ""being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special"" is likely meant to be ironic or sarcastic. the phrase ""does make me feel special"" is a clear indication of sarcasm, as phoebe is downplaying her special feeling and making it sound unimpressive.

**cues extraction:**

1. **emotional contrasts:** there is a contrast between the initial conversation about a loaner car and the sudden shift to a casual conversation about a game.
2. **special symbols:** none
3. **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""so, did you see who won the game?"" is an example of a rhetorical question, as it's unlikely that person1 is genuinely interested in the answer.
4. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be casual and light-hearted, with a hint of playfulness.
5. **common knowledge:** the conversation is about a loaner car and a game, which are common topics in everyday conversations.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of the response is sarcastic because person1 is downplaying the effort required to get a loaner car (emphasizing the presence of multiple helpers) and then suddenly switching to a seemingly unrelated topic (the game). the rhetorical question about the game is also a giveaway, as it's unlikely that person1 is genuinely interested in the answer. the overall tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

**emotional words:** none

**common knowledge:** none

**emotional contrasts:** none

**keywords:** ""by myself"", ""had a doctor"", ""had a nurse"", ""had a helper guy"", ""did you see who won the game""

**topic:** the conversation about person1's experience with getting a loaner car

### analysis:

the input text appears to be a continuation of the conversation about person1's experience with getting a loaner car. person1 is providing a humorous explanation of how they were not alone when getting the loaner car, and then suddenly shifts the topic to asking about the game. the use of the phrase ""so, did you see who won the game?"" seems out of place and is likely intended to be humorous.

### label:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the input text is playful and lighthearted, with a clear intention to be humorous. the sudden shift in topic and the use of a seemingly unrelated question (""did you see who won the game?"") are cues that suggest the text is sarcastic.",1,"assistant

### cues extraction:

**context:** the conversation is about person1 having a medical procedure and person2 showing concern.

**common knowledge:** medical procedures typically involve a team of healthcare professionals, not just one person.

**keywords:** ""doctor"", ""nurse"", ""helper guy"", ""by myself"", ""win the game"" (out of context, but might indicate a sudden shift in topic)

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** person1's response seems to downplay the help they received during the procedure, and then suddenly shifts the topic to the game, which is an unexpected change in emotional tone.

### label:
**sarcastic**

the response appears to be sarcastic because person1 is downplaying the help they received during the procedure, which is an unusual thing to do. the sudden shift in topic to the game also suggests that person1 is trying to deflect attention from their earlier situation, which is a common sarcastic tactic.",1,1

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the input text is skepticism or doubt.

**rhetorical devices:** the input text uses a rhetorical device called irony, specifically verbal irony, where the speaker's words convey a meaning that is opposite of their literal meaning. the speaker is being sarcastic by saying ""i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"" when in reality, they are implying that the other person doesn't know anything about their relationship.

**topic:** the topic of the conversation is the speaker's desire to hang out with the other person, and their skepticism about the other person's understanding of their relationship.

**emotional words:** the emotional words used in the input text are ""doubt"" and ""skepticism"".

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge required to understand the input text is the context of the conversation, specifically rachel's previous statement about never really talking to the other person.

**label:** based on the cues extracted, the label for the input text is **sarcastic**.",1,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion in the input text is a hint of annoyance or frustration, as rachel is making a sarcastic comment.

**emotional words:** the emotional word is ""guess"", which is used in a sarcastic tone to imply that rachel doesn't actually think the other person would know that.

**punctuation:** the punctuation used is a question mark (?), which is a common way to end a sarcastic statement.

**language style:** the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcasm in everyday speech.

**rhetorical devices:** the rhetorical device used is irony, as rachel is saying the opposite of what she means. she's implying that the other person wouldn't know that, even though they are one of the two people rachel is referring to.

**label:** given these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text.",1,"assistant

* common knowledge: none
* emotional words: none

### analysis:

the input sentence ""i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"" is likely sarcastic because of the tone and the use of the question mark. the sentence is phrased as a question, but the content is not genuinely inquiring; it's more likely a statement of irony. the phrase ""i guess"" is also a common sarcastic phrase, implying that the speaker doesn't really believe what they're saying.

let's extract the cues from the input text to classify the sarcasm:

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""i'm sorry"" is an emotional expression, but it's followed by ""i tried to stop it but they put me in jail!"", which is a contradictory and unexpected statement, indicating a contrast between the expected apology and the actual situation.

**punctuation:** the use of an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence (""i tried to stop it but they put me in jail!"") adds emphasis and surprise, which is consistent with the emotional contrast.

**emotional words:** the words ""sorry"" and ""tried"" have emotional connotations, but the phrase ""put me in jail"" is an unexpected and humorous twist, which suggests sarcasm.

**common knowledge:** the situation described is unlikely and absurd, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.

based on these cues, i would assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the use of emotional contrasts, punctuation, and emotional words, along with the absurdity of the situation, all point to a sarcastic tone in the input text.",1,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* special symbols: none
* common knowledge: the conversation is from a tv show (friends), and the characters are chandler and phoebe.
* punctuation: the input text contains periods (.) and exclamation marks (!).
* topic: the topic is about a gift or item being bought, and phoebe's attempt to stop it.
* rhetorical devices: none obvious, but the tone of the conversation is playful and humorous.

**label:**

based on the cues extracted, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the tone of phoebe's response is lighthearted and humorous, and the use of exaggerated language (""oh my god"", ""i'm sorry"", ""they put me in jail!"") suggests a playful and ironic tone, which is typical of sarcastic speech.",1,"assistant

**cues extracted from the input text:**

* **special symbols:** none
* **punctuation:**! (exclamation mark), but it's not used in a way that's typical of sarcastic speech (e.g., it's not used to emphasize a statement that's the opposite of what's meant)
* **surface emotion:** phoebe appears to be expressing genuine apology and regret
* **keywords:** ""i'm sorry"", ""tried to stop it"", ""put me in jail"" (these words convey a sense of remorse and helplessness)
* **emotional contrasts:** none (the emotions expressed are consistent with the situation)

**label:** 'not sarcastic'

the tone of phoebe's speech is apologetic and regretful, with no indication of irony, mocking, or mocking tone, which are typical characteristics of sarcastic speech.",0,1

### response:
the special symbols in the input text are: none.

the language style used is informal, with a tone that is conversational and slightly playful.

the cultural background is western, likely american, given the use of informal language and the context of a tv show.

the punctuation used is a question mark at the end of the sentence, which is typical of a direct question.

the emotional words used are ""matter"", which has a slightly negative connotation, and ""face"", which is a somewhat confrontational or accusatory word.

### label: sarcastic

the tone of the sentence is clearly sarcastic, with monica's question implying that chandler's face is somehow unusual or unattractive. the use of the word ""matter"" and the direct question also contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the input text is anger or frustration, as monica is asking a question that implies chandler's face is in a bad condition.

**special symbols:** none.

**common knowledge:** the context is a conversation between friends, specifically between monica and chandler, who are likely discussing their marriage and future.

**emotional contrasts:** the emotional contrast is between the surface emotion of anger/frustration and the potential underlying emotion of sarcasm, as monica's question is likely meant to be humorous or ironic rather than genuinely concerned about chandler's face.

**context:** the conversation is lighthearted and playful, with a tone that suggests the friends are joking around.

to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

**emotional contrasts:** the input text is a declaration of love, which is an intense and positive emotion. however, the previous conversation between chandler and monica was about getting married, which is a significant and serious commitment. this contrast between the seriousness of the situation and the sudden declaration of love might indicate sarcasm.

* common knowledge:
	+ it is common knowledge that romantic declarations often involve strong emotions and exaggerated language.

considering these cues, i would assign the label ""not sarcastic"" to the input text. the statement ""i've never loved anybody as much as i love you"" is a sincere and romantic declaration, and the tone is not sarcastic.",0,"assistant

**cues extraction:**

* emotional words: ""proud""
* surface emotion: positive (monica's statement)
* keywords: ""proud"", ""president"", ""call"", ""stomach""
* punctuation: none
* rhetorical devices: irony (chandler's statement is unlikely to be true)

**label:**

the input text is **sarcastic**. the cue ""irony"" suggests that chandler's statement is not meant to be taken literally, and the tone is playful and mocking. additionally, joey's response ""no just, nobody press on my stomach"" is a humorous and unexpected reaction to the previous conversation, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**context:** the conversation is taking place among friends in a casual setting, and the tone is light-hearted and playful.

**emotional words:** none that stand out as particularly emotional or intense.

**special symbols:** none.

**rhetorical devices:** none that are immediately apparent.

**punctuation:** the sentence ends with a period (.) and has a simple structure.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of the sentence is playful and humorous, and the phrase ""nobody press on my stomach"" is likely meant to be ironic or humorous, implying that joey doesn't want anyone to touch his stomach, possibly because he's feeling bloated or uncomfortable. the tone is not serious or sincere, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

to classify the sarcasm in the input text, i will extract the following cues:

* punctuation: the input text does not contain any unusual punctuation, but the context provides a hint.
* cultural background: the dialogue appears to be from a western, possibly american, cultural context.
* special symbols: none.
* keywords: ""nobody press on my stomach"" seems like an unusual request, which could be a clue.
* common knowledge: the phrase ""nobody press on my stomach"" is not a typical request, and it's likely that the speaker is being sarcastic.

given these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the phrase ""nobody press on my stomach"" is likely a sarcastic way of saying ""please don't touch my stomach"" or ""stop poking me"". the context of the conversation, where joey is being praised by his friends, makes it clear that he's being facetious.",1,1

**topic:** the topic is a conversation between friends, specifically ross and phoebe, about monica and chandler.

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge is that monica and chandler are characters from the tv show friends, and ross is one of their friends.

**emotional words:** there are no obvious emotional words in this short input text.

**keywords:** the keywords are ""um"", ""excuse"", ""me"", ""moment"", which suggest a polite and brief interruption.

**label:** based on the cues, i would assign the label **'not sarcastic'**. the language used is polite and formal, indicating a genuine request for a moment, rather than a sarcastic tone.",0,"assistant

### cues:

* punctuation: the sentence ends with a question mark (?), which is a common feature of sarcastic language.
* context: the conversation is taking place in a sitcom, where sarcasm is a common tone. additionally, ross's previous response (""oh my god! of course, of course."") was enthusiastic and over-the-top, which makes his sudden need to excuse himself seem suspicious.
* special symbols: none
* rhetorical devices: the phrase ""umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?"" is a classic example of a rhetorical device called a ""hedging phrase"", which is often used to soften the tone of a statement and make it seem more polite. however, in this context, it comes across as insincere and potentially sarcastic.
* emotional contrasts: ross's sudden change in tone from enthusiastic to hesitant and polite is a significant emotional contrast that suggests he may be being sarcastic.

### response:

ross's response seems to be an attempt to deflect attention or avoid discussing monica and chandler, which was the urgent matter phoebe wanted to discuss.

### label:

based on the cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

### cues:

* cultural background: american tv show ""friends"" ( sitcom)
* keywords: ""excuse me"", ""moment"", ""monica and chandler"" (previous conversation)
* emotional contrasts: phoebe's urgent tone vs. ross's calm response (previous conversation)
* topic: monica and chandler (previous conversation)
* common knowledge: phoebe and ross are friends and part of the same group

### analysis:

the input text ""ross: umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?"" is a polite and formal request, which is unusual for ross's character in the show. he usually reacts with more enthusiasm and interest in the conversation. the use of ""ummm"" and the formal language (""would you please excuse me"") suggest that ross is trying to avoid or change the topic, which is not his usual behavior. this deviation from his usual tone and behavior is a hint of sarcasm.

* **topic:** relationship and romance
* **emotional contrasts:** ross's emotional declaration (sincere and romantic) vs. rachel's blunt and dismissive response (lacking emotional resonance)

**label:** **sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because rachel's response ""no"" is an unexpected and abrupt rejection of ross's romantic declaration, implying a lack of emotional investment or sincerity. the use of a simple ""no"" without any additional explanation or emotional context creates a sense of irony and detachment, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* punctuation: none notable

* surface emotion: none apparent
* emotional words: none

the label for the input text is: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

here are the cues extracted from the input text:

* rhetorical devices: none

* topic: coke, taste change
* emotional words: upset
* context: the conversation is about rose's emotional state and the topic of coke, which is a common everyday topic.

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**special symbols:** none

**context:** the conversation is about a person being depressed, and the previous speaker (rose) asked if it's related to rebecca. this context suggests that the conversation is about a serious topic, but the current speaker (dorothy) might be trying to make a joke or divert attention.

**cultural background:** american, as the conversation appears to be a casual dialogue between two people.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be playful or humorous, as dorothy is making a comment that seems unrelated to the original topic.

**punctuation:** the sentence is grammatically correct and uses standard punctuation.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the comment about marvel having manners only once a week seems out of place in the conversation and is likely intended to be humorous or ironic, rather than a serious statement.",1,"assistant

### extracted cues:

**keywords:** depressed, marvel, manners

**context:** the conversation is about a character named person being depressed, and rose is asking for the reason behind it. dorothy is providing an explanation.

**emotional words:** depressed (negative emotion)

**language style:** dorothy's response is concise and direct, which might suggest a lack of emotional investment or empathy.

**common knowledge:** there is no specific common knowledge required to understand the conversation, but it appears to be a fictional context.

### analysis:

dorothy's response seems to be making a joke or a humorous comment about marvel's manners being limited to once a week, which is an unlikely and absurd reason for someone being depressed. the tone of the response is playful and lighthearted, which suggests that dorothy is being sarcastic.

### label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

### cues extraction:

* **common knowledge:** depression is a serious mental health condition, and marvel's manners (or lack thereof) are not a common cause of depression.
* **surface emotion:** the tone of the input text appears to be humorous or ironic, rather than serious or concerned.
* **topic:** the topic is about rose's question about dorothy's opinion on someone being depressed, and dorothy's response about marvel's manners.
* **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the serious topic of depression and the lighthearted, trivial reason for depression (marvel's manners) suggests sarcasm.
* **emotional words:** none explicitly emotional words are present, but the phrase ""only once a week"" implies a sense of absurdity or irony.

### label:
based on the cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the input text is likely sarcastic because it uses a ridiculous reason (marvel's manners) to explain someone's depression, which is a serious condition. the tone is playful and ironic, suggesting that dorothy is being facetious rather than serious.",1,1

to classify the sarcasm in the input text, i'll extract the following cues:

1. **punctuation**: the input text contains a few commas (,) and a period (.) which are typical punctuation marks used in casual conversations.
2. **cultural background**: the reference to sonny bono, a famous musician and politician, and palm springs, a city in california, suggests an american cultural background.
3. **emotional contrasts**: the initial statement ""no, i am nervous because sonny bono gets elected mayor of palm springs, he is gonna make all the postmens wear leather bell bottoms and a fur vest."" seems to contrast the expected reason for nervousness (meeting michael's fiancée) with an absurd and humorous reason (sonny bono's hypothetical mayoral policies).
4. **rhetorical devices**: the use of hyperbole (""leather bell bottoms and a fur vest"") and an unlikely scenario (a politician making such a bizarre decision) are rhetorical devices that suggest sarcasm.
5. **keywords**: the keywords ""sonny bono"", ""palm springs"", ""leather bell bottoms"", and ""fur vest"" are unlikely to be used in a serious conversation, further suggesting sarcasm.

the input text is sarcastic because dorothy's response about the ring turning up on the home shopping network is unlikely and unexpected, implying that she's being facetious or mocking the situation. the use of irony and the surface emotion of anger or frustration also suggest a sarcastic tone.",1,"after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**language style:** informal, conversational tone with a hint of playfulness.

**special symbols:** none.

**topic:** the conversation is about a personal experience of dorothy's, specifically about a failed proposal.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the language style and tone suggest a lighthearted, playful approach, but the topic and emotional contrasts hint at a layer of irony and possibly even mockery. the use of a mundane, unexpected location (the home shopping network) as the answer to rose's question adds to the sarcastic tone.",1,"### extracted cues:

* keywords: ""champagne"", ""engagement ring"", ""home shopping network""
* rhetorical devices: none apparent
* emotional words: ""smile"", ""wink"", ""disappointing"", ""embarrassing""

### analysis:

the text is likely sarcastic because of the unexpected and humorous twist at the end. dorothy's response about the engagement ring turning up on the home shopping network is an unexpected and ironic punchline that adds to the comedic tone. the use of emotional contrasts and the unexpected turn of events also contribute to the sarcastic tone.

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony: dorothy's statement ""no i am upset because crocodin turbs are wearing darker colors"" is ironic because it is an unexpected and unrelated reason for being upset, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.

**cultural background:**

* none explicitly mentioned, but the context of a conversation between two characters in a fictional setting suggests a western cultural background.

**emotional contrasts:**

* the statement expresses a sudden and unexpected change in emotion, from being upset to being upset for a seemingly trivial reason, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

**common knowledge:**

* the concept of being upset due to a personal issue or conflict is common knowledge, but the specific reason given (crocodin turbs wearing darker colors) is not.

**surface emotion:**

* the surface emotion expressed is upset, but the tone and content of the statement suggest a deeper emotion, such as annoyance or frustration, which is often masked by sarcasm.

based on these cues, i assign the correct label for the input text as:

**sarcastic**",1,"assistant

**topic:** conversation between dorothy and blanche about a past disagreement

**emotional words:** upset

**cultural background:** none explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests a conversation between two individuals, possibly friends or acquaintances, in a social setting

**emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""i am upset because"" suggests a contrast between the expected emotional response (upset) and the unexpected reason (crocodiles wearing darker colors)

**special symbols:** none

**label:** **sarcastic**

the text is sarcastic because dorothy's response is an unexpected and unrelated reason for being upset, implying that she is not actually upset about the issue blanche mentioned (last night's disagreement). the use of ""because crocodiles are wearing darker colors"" is an obvious non-sequitur, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

**language style:** the language used is informal, with a conversational tone, which is typical of a dialogue between two people.

**keywords:** ""crocodin turbs"", ""darker colors""

**emotional words:** ""upset""

**punctuation:** the sentence is well-punctuated, with a clear subject-verb-object structure.

**common knowledge:** there is no common knowledge that can be extracted from this sentence.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the sentence is sarcastic because dorothy is responding to blanche's question about being upset with her about last night, but instead of giving a straightforward answer, dorothy gives a ridiculous reason for being upset, implying that she is not actually upset about last night. the use of ""crocodin turbs"" and ""darker colors"" as reasons for being upset is an obvious exaggeration and a clear indication of sarcasm.",1,1

**keywords:** liberarche, marquee, caesar's palace

**common knowledge:** caesar's palace is a famous hotel and casino in las vegas, known for its entertainment options, including marquee displays.

**special symbols:** none

**rhetorical devices:** irony (specifically, sarcasm) - dorothy's statement is unexpected and humorous, implying that the ""liberarche marquee"" is a ridiculous or unimportant thing to be coming down, especially in the context of a weather conversation.

**label:** **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

### extracted cues:

* **context:** the conversation is about the weather, with dorothy and rose discussing what's happening outside.
* **special symbols:** none
* **rhetorical devices:** none
* **keywords:** ""liberarche marquee"", ""caesar's palace""
* **topic:** the topic is about a specific location (caesar's palace) and a sign or display (marquee).

### analysis:

the input text appears to be a humorous response to rose's question about what's coming down. dorothy's response is unexpected and unrelated to the weather, which is the original topic. the use of the specific location and sign/display is likely meant to be ironic or playful.

### label:

**sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because the response is intentionally humorous and unrelated to the original topic, indicating a tone of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the input text, i will extract the cues to classify the text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic'.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with a conversational tone, which is common in everyday conversations.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely american, as caesar's palace is a prominent landmark in las vegas, a city in the united states.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the use of the word ""liberarche"" is likely a made-up or nonsensical word, and the mention of caesar's palace is an unexpected and humorous twist, suggesting that dorothy is being sarcastic.",0,1

### extracted cues:

* keywords: ""obsession"", ""commercials""
* context: the conversation is about dorothy's emotional state and her snapping at rose. rose is trying to understand the reason behind dorothy's upset.
* cultural background: american, likely 21st century (due to the reference to commercials)
* language style: informal, conversational
* special symbols: none

### analysis:

the keyword ""obsession"" is likely to be used in a sarcastic tone, as it's an unusual thing to be upset about in a commercial. the context suggests that dorothy is trying to downplay her real reason for being upset and is using a seemingly unrelated topic to avoid discussing the actual issue.

### label:

* context: the conversation is between two characters, dorothy and rose, and they are discussing dorothy's upset mood. the context suggests that dorothy is emotional and may be using sarcasm to express herself.
* punctuation: the input text uses a period (.) at the end, which is a typical punctuation mark used in declarative sentences. however, the sentence structure and tone suggest that it may be a sarcastic comment.
* cultural background: the cultural background is not explicitly mentioned, but the language and conversation style suggest a modern-day american setting.
* emotional words: the word ""obsession"" is used, which can be an emotional trigger. additionally, dorothy mentions that she ""cannot make any sense"" of the commercials, which implies frustration.
* language style: the language style is informal, with a conversational tone. the sentence structure is simple, with a clear subject-verb-object format.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the input text appears to be a sarcastic comment, as dorothy is expressing frustration and annoyance at the commercials for obsession. the tone is informal and conversational, and the language style suggests a modern-day american setting. the emotional words and punctuation also support the classification of the input text as sarcastic.",1,"assistant

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony (obsession is a word that is often associated with a strong emotional attachment, but in this context, dorothy is using it to express her frustration with the commercials)
* understatement (dorothy is downplaying her reaction to the commercials, implying that her upset is more intense than she's letting on)

**language style:**

* informal tone (dorothy is speaking in a conversational manner, using contractions and colloquial language)
* direct address (dorothy is speaking directly to rose, using the phrase ""its because i cannot make any sense of those commercials for obsession"")

* upset (expressing dorothy's emotional state)
* frustration (implied by dorothy's use of the phrase ""i cannot make any sense of"")

**topic:**

* **sarcastic**

the use of irony and understatement, combined with the informal tone and direct address, suggest that dorothy is being sarcastic in her response. the phrase ""for obsession"" is also an example of irony, as it's unlikely that the commercials are actually about obsession. overall, the tone and language of the response are consistent with a sarcastic tone.",1,1

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the input text is sadness or depression.

**punctuation:** the punctuation used in the input text is proper, with correct use of commas and periods.

**emotional contrasts:** there is an emotional contrast between the expected answer (no, i'm not depressed) and the actual answer (yes, i'm depressed). this contrast suggests that dorothy is being sarcastic.

based on these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**",1,"assistant

### cues extracted:

* **common knowledge:** glen is likely a person or a topic of conversation that the speaker (rose) is referring to, but the context is not provided. phillis george is a well-known american journalist, which is a piece of common knowledge.
* **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""no"" by dorothy is a negation, which is a common rhetorical device used to convey the opposite of what is being asked. the phrase ""because phillis george left the morning news"" is an unexpected reason for being depressed, which is a form of irony.
* **context:** the conversation is likely taking place in a social setting, possibly with friends or colleagues, and the topic of conversation is a recent event or news story.
* **keywords:** ""depressed"", ""phillis george"", ""morning news""
* **cultural background:** the conversation appears to be set in a western cultural background, likely in the united states, given the reference to a morning news program.

### label:
**sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because the response by dorothy is unexpected and ironic. the speaker is not actually depressed about phillis george leaving the morning news, but is using the situation as a humorous way to deflect the original question about being depressed about glen. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, indicating sarcasm.",1,1

* emotional words: the input text contains strong emotional words like ""death"" which evokes a sense of shock and alarm.
* topic: the topic is related to health and well-being, specifically an elderly person's health.
* context: the context is a conversation between friends, specifically dorothy and rose, in a setting that appears to be a home or hospital.

**cues extraction:**

1. **emotional contrasts:** the input text contains a contrast between the expected emotional tone and the actual emotional tone. dorothy initially expresses frustration and difficulty studying with an 80-year-old, but then suddenly changes the topic to carrey grant living in a broom closet, which is an unexpected and humorous twist.
2. **common knowledge:** there is no common knowledge in this specific input text that would indicate sarcasm.
3. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be playful and humorous, as dorothy suddenly introduces a fictional and absurd scenario about carrey grant living in a broom closet.
4. **special symbols:** none.
5. **emotional words:** the emotional words used are ""hard enough"", which implies frustration, but this is quickly replaced by a more playful tone.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the cues suggest that dorothy is using sarcasm to express her frustration and difficulty studying with an 80-year-old, but then quickly shifts to a more playful and humorous tone by introducing an absurd scenario about carrey grant. the emotional contrast, playful language, and sudden shift in tone are all indicative of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will assign a label to the text.

**cultural background:** american (referring to carrey grant, a famous american actor)

**keywords:** french final, fourteen year old, eighty year old, broom closet

**surface emotion:** frustration

**special symbols:** none

**emotional words:** none

after analyzing the cues, i conclude that the text is **sarcastic**. the use of ""of course no ma"" and the absurdity of carrey grant living in a broom closet are indicators of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

i can do that!

**common knowledge:** none, as the reference to cary grant and the broom closet is not a common piece of knowledge.

**context:** the conversation is about dorothy trying to study for a french final, and sophia asking who she is referring to. the previous mention of an 80-year-old and a 14-year-old in the house sets the context.

**cultural background:** the reference to cary grant, an american actor, is a cultural reference.

**punctuation:** the text uses proper punctuation, including commas and periods.

**special symbols:** none.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the tone of the response is clearly sarcastic, as dorothy is using a famous actor's name (cary grant) in an absurd and unlikely scenario (living in a broom closet) to deflect sophia's question. the use of ""of course no ma"" also implies a hint of sarcasm.",1,1

**cues:**

* special symbols: none
* rhetorical devices:
	+ hyperbole: ""throwing up in the pool, passing out in the punch bowl, and relieving yourself in the linen closet"" (exaggerated and absurd description)
	+ irony: the invitation is clearly not meant to be taken literally and is intended to be humorous and mocking
* topic: the topic is an invitation to a new year's eve party, but the tone is sarcastic and mocking
* emotional contrasts: the contrast between the initial polite invitation and the subsequent explicit and absurd description is a clear indicator of sarcasm
* punctuation: none notable

**label:** sarcastic",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**emotional contrasts:** the input text describes a series of unpleasant and chaotic events, which is in contrast to the initial polite invitation from dorothy.

**common knowledge:** there is no common knowledge that can be extracted from this text, as it appears to be a unique and unusual scenario.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it seems to be a western cultural reference (new year's eve celebration).

**rhetorical devices:** the text uses a rhetorical device called hyperbole, exaggerating the events to make them more vivid and attention-grabbing.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the text is one of disgust, annoyance, and possibly even humor (due to the absurdity of the scenario).

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the text is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine invitation to a party.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* **keywords**: ""naked women"", ""throwing up"", ""passing out"", ""relieving yourself"" (these words are likely to be used in a sarcastic tone)
* **common knowledge**: it's unlikely that someone would actually suggest such a scenario for a new year's eve party, as it's not a typical or socially acceptable activity.
* **punctuation**: the sentence is written in a straightforward and matter-of-fact tone, without any hint of irony or sarcasm markers such as commas or exclamation points.
* **surface emotion**: the tone of the sentence is neutral, without any apparent emotion or enthusiasm.
* **topic**: the topic is a hypothetical new year's eve party scenario.

### label:
based on these cues, i would assign the label **sarcastic** to the input text. the sentence is likely meant to be humorous or ironic, and the use of explicit language and absurd scenario suggests that the speaker is being facetious.",1,1

* emotional contrasts: the text does not contain explicit emotional contrasts, but it can be inferred that the conversation is playful and lighthearted.

* language style: the text is written in a casual and conversational tone, which is typical of everyday dialogue.

### analysis:

the response ""to feed the cat rose"" seems to be a straightforward answer to the question, but the context of the conversation and the use of understatement suggest that it might be sarcastic. the speaker is likely being facetious, implying that the reason rose needs a kidney is not for a serious medical purpose, but rather for a trivial or humorous reason (i.e., to feed a cat). therefore, i would assign the label:

### label: sarcastic",1,"assistant

**cues:**

1. **emotional contrasts:** the conversation starts with a serious tone (requesting a kidney) and then takes a unexpected turn to a mundane topic (feeding a cat).
2. **rhetorical devices:** the use of irony is evident, as the original request for a kidney is suddenly replaced with a trivial reason.
3. **punctuation:** the sentence structure is simple and straightforward, without any unusual punctuation that would indicate sarcasm.
4. **context:** the conversation is between friends, and the topic of a kidney transplant is unusual, making it more likely that the response is sarcastic.
5. **language style:** the language used is casual and conversational, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.

**label:** **sarcastic**

**topic:** the topic is a kidney, specifically why someone would need one.

**cultural background:** the cultural background is likely american, as the names dorothy, blanche, and rose are common in american culture.

**common knowledge:** the common knowledge is that kidneys are organs that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood, and that they can be donated or transplanted to someone in need.

**emotional words:** there are no overtly emotional words in the input text, but the topic of a kidney transplant can be a serious and emotional issue.

### label:

based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text ""to feed the cat rose."" the response is likely sarcastic because it is an unexpected and humorous reason for needing a kidney transplant, and the tone is playful and ironic.",1,1

* context: the context is a conversation between two characters, rose and dorothy, and the topic is seemingly about someone leaving and coming back.
* topic: the topic is about a person's emotional response to someone leaving and potentially coming back.

### cues:

* **rhetorical devices:** the response contains a sarcastic tone, which is a form of irony, implying that showing slides of hawaii is not a helpful or relevant solution to the problem.
* **emotional words:** the word ""wait"" in the initial sentence by rose creates a sense of urgency and emotional appeal, which is contrasted with the nonchalant and unhelpful response by dorothy, highlighting the sarcasm.
* **context:** the context of the conversation is a crisis situation (rose's concern about someone coming back), which makes dorothy's response seem out of place and unhelpful, adding to the sarcastic tone.
* **punctuation:** the response is concise and lacks any emotional punctuation (e.g., exclamation marks), which is unusual in a conversation and suggests a sarcastic tone.
* **common knowledge:** showing slides of hawaii is not a common or helpful solution to a crisis situation, making the response seem absurd and sarcastic.",1,"assistant

* **emotional contrasts:** the emotional tone of the input text is likely to be humorous or playful, given the unexpected and seemingly unrelated suggestion to show slides of hawaii.
* **keywords:** the keywords in the input text are ""slides of hawaii"", which are unexpected and unrelated to the original concern.

### classification:

based on the extracted cues, i would classify the input text as **sarcastic**. the suggestion to show slides of hawaii is an obvious non-sequitur and is likely intended to be humorous or ironic, rather than a serious solution to the speaker's concern.",1,1

the presence of the emotional word ""upset"" suggests that the speaker is expressing a genuine emotional response. however, the keywords ""joe piscapo"" and ""rain man"" are unexpected and unrelated to the typical reasons for being upset. this unexpected twist and the use of a specific celebrity's name (joe piscapo) are common cues for sarcasm.

**context:** a conversation between two characters, likely in a comedic or satirical setting (considering the absurdity of the topic)

**emotional contrasts:** the speaker (dorothy) claims to be upset about something, but the topic is unrelated to their actual emotional state (they are not upset about the house or living arrangement, but rather about a celebrity's acting role)

considering these cues, i would assign a label of:

* special symbols: none

### label: sarcastic

the input text seems to be using the original context as a setup to make a humorous and unrelated comment about michael jackson and the elephant man. the use of the emotional word ""worried"" in an unexpected way, combined with the unrelated keywords, suggests that the tone is likely sarcastic.",1,"assistant

**cues:**

* **emotional words:** none (no emotional words like ""angry"", ""frustrated"", ""upset"", etc.)
* **language style:** the language used is informal, with a touch of absurdity and irrelevance to the original topic (money owed to the government).
* **cultural background:** no specific cultural background is mentioned, but the reference to michael jackson and the elephant man suggests a western cultural context.

**punctuation:** none (the text is a single sentence)

**cultural background:** american (based on the context of the tv show ""schitt's creek"")

**language style:** conversational, informal

**emotional words:** none (the text is neutral and lacks emotional language)

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the use of the cappucino maker as a response to ""what's under the sheets"" is an unexpected and humorous twist, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i assign the label:

**sarcastic**

here's why:

* **common knowledge**: the conversation is about what's under the sheets, which is a common topic in a romantic or intimate setting.
* **cultural background**: the conversation is likely set in a modern, western cultural context where cappuccino makers are a common household appliance.
* **context**: the conversation is a humorous exchange between two characters, dorothy and rose, where dorothy's response is unexpected and playful.
* **punctuation**: the sentence is written in a casual, conversational tone, with no obvious emotional markers like exclamation marks or question marks.
* **rhetorical devices**: dorothy's response uses irony and understatement, implying that the cappuccino maker is not a typical or exciting thing to find under the sheets, which is a common technique used in sarcasm.

overall, the cues suggest that dorothy's response is intended to be humorous and playful, using sarcasm to poke fun at the idea that a cappuccino maker is the only thing they have in common.",1,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**punctuation:** none

**emotional words:** none

**rhetorical devices:** the text appears to be a play on words, using the common phrase ""under the sheets"" (referring to intimate or romantic situations) and applying it to a mundane object (a cappuccino maker). this could be considered a form of wordplay, which is a rhetorical device.

**common knowledge:** the phrase ""under the sheets"" is a common idiomatic expression that implies a romantic or intimate situation.

**special symbols:** none

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the text is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, implying that the only thing the two characters have in common is a shared interest in a mundane object (a cappuccino maker), rather than a romantic or intimate connection. the use of wordplay and the unexpected twist on the common phrase ""under the sheets"" suggests a sarcastic tone.",1,1

### extracted cues:

* emotional contrasts: none
* surface emotion: dorothy's initial statement ""no"" implies a sense of denial or disagreement, but it's not clear what emotion is being expressed.
* rhetorical devices: dorothy's response is an example of a non-sequitur, where she changes the topic abruptly. this can be seen as a rhetorical device to divert attention from the original topic of rose's concern.
* punctuation: the use of a single ""no"" without additional punctuation creates a sense of abruptness and directness.
* keywords: ""rose"", ""kitchen""

### analysis:

dorothy's response is an example of sarcasm. she is downplaying the severity of the situation (rose's concern about dorothy's mother being in jail) by introducing a seemingly unrelated topic (the rose in the kitchen). the non-sequitur and abrupt tone of the response suggest that dorothy is being facetious and ironic. the label for this input text is:

**language style:**
the language used is informal, with a conversational tone, which is typical of a casual conversation between friends.

**context:**
the conversation is about a joke that was heard in a teacher's lounge, and the speakers are discussing a person named dorothy. the tone is lighthearted and humorous.

**special symbols:**
none.

**cultural background:**
the conversation appears to be from a western, possibly american, cultural background, given the references to a teacher's lounge and a radio.

**emotional words:**
the word ""sorry"" is used, which suggests a hint of apology or empathy, but the tone is still lighthearted and playful.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. the phrase ""in dorothy's defence"" is a common way to introduce a sarcastic comment, and the statement ""it sure sounds a lot like her"" is likely meant to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine defense. the tone is playful and teasing, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.",0,"### cues extraction:

the input text appears to be sarcastic because rose is apologizing for defending dorothy, which implies that rose is being ironic or tongue-in-cheek. the apology is likely a way to convey that rose is actually agreeing with the original joke's criticism of dorothy, rather than genuinely apologizing.",1,"### cues extraction:

1. **punctuation**: the input text contains a period (.) at the end, which is a common punctuation mark used to conclude a sentence.

2. **language style**: the language used is informal, with a conversational tone, as it appears to be a dialogue between friends.

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i will classify the input text as follows:

**cultural background:** american (assuming the context is from the classic 1939 film ""the wizard of oz"")

**surface emotion:** playful and humorous

**punctuation:** none

**language style:** colloquial and informal

**emotional words:** none

the input text ""because it wears a little sunbrella rose."" is a witty and humorous response that is likely intended to be sarcastic. the use of the word ""sunbrella"" (a play on the word ""umbrella"") is a clever and unexpected twist, which suggests that dorothy is being sarcastic.

therefore, i assign the label:

**label:** sarcastic",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

**emotional words:** none

**keywords:** sunbrella, spanish fly, beetle

**context:** the conversation is about the classification of a beetle as a ""fly"" due to its name ""spanish fly"". dorothy is providing a humorous explanation for the name.

**rhetorical devices:** hyperbole (exaggeration) - ""wears a little sunbrella"" (implying that the beetle has a sunbrella, which is an absurd notion)

**punctuation:** none notable

### analysis:

the input text is likely sarcastic because it uses a hyperbole to explain the origin of the name ""spanish fly"". the phrase ""wears a little sunbrella"" is an obvious exaggeration and is meant to be humorous. the tone is playful and ironic, which are common characteristics of sarcastic language.

### label:
**sarcastic**",1,"assistant

based on the extracted cues:

* language style: playful, whimsical, and humorous, with a touch of wordplay (e.g., ""sunbrella"" instead of ""umbrella"").
* cultural background: american, likely influenced by popular culture (e.g., the idea of a sunbrella).
* topic: conversation about a spanish fly beetle.
* punctuation: none, which is unusual in written text but common in spoken dialogue.
* emotional words: none, as the tone is more playful and lighthearted than emotional.

given these cues, i would assign a label of:

**sarcastic**

the language style, cultural background, and topic all suggest a playful and humorous tone, while the lack of emotional words and punctuation indicate that the tone is not overly serious. the use of wordplay and whimsy in the phrase ""sunbrella"" also suggests a sarcastic or ironic tone.",1,1

### cues:

* **context**: rose asks about cooking, which is a common everyday activity. this sets a casual and mundane tone.
* **surface emotion**: dorothy's response seems to be matter-of-fact and neutral, without any apparent emotional tone.
* **cultural background**: no specific cultural background is mentioned, but the conversation appears to be in a casual, informal setting.
* **keywords**: ""developing pictures"", ""magellan space probe"" - these keywords suggest a scientific or technical topic, which is unusual in a cooking conversation.
* **special symbols**: none.

### analysis:

the response from dorothy seems to be a clear departure from the expected conversation about cooking. the mention of a space probe and developing pictures suggests a topic that is unrelated to cooking and is likely to be of interest to a small group of people with a specific background or expertise. the neutral tone and lack of emotional language further support the idea that this response is not sarcastic.

* topic: space exploration
* emotional words: none

based on these cues, i assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. the response from dorothy seems to be a witty and unexpected reply to rose's question about cooking, implying that dorothy is being sarcastic and playful.",1,"assistant

### cues:

* rhetorical devices: the response from dorothy is a clever and unexpected twist on the typical expectation of a conversation about cooking. this use of unexpectedness is a rhetorical device known as ""irony"".
* language style: the language used by dorothy is formal and technical, which is unusual in a casual conversation about cooking. this formal tone adds to the irony and suggests that dorothy is not interested in cooking.
* context: the context of the conversation is a casual greeting between two friends, which is not typical of a scientific or technical discussion. this mismatch between the expected and actual context adds to the surprise and irony of dorothy's response.
* emotional contrasts: the emotional tone of the conversation is dry and matter-of-fact, with no apparent emotional investment or enthusiasm. this lack of emotional investment is a contrast to the typical emotional tone of a conversation about cooking, which might be more enthusiastic or excited.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the response is one of detachment and lack of interest.

**punctuation:** the lack of punctuation or emphasis in the response (""a hand puppet rose."") contributes to the deadpan delivery and lack of emotional inflection, which is typical of sarcastic speech.

**emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the seriousness of the question (""with what?"") and the absurdity of the response (""a hand puppet rose."") creates a sense of emotional contrast, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i would assign a label of:

**sarcastic**

here's my reasoning:

* **punctuation**: the text uses a period at the end, which is a common punctuation mark in sarcastic statements.
* **common knowledge**: the phrase ""niagra falls in a barrel"" is an idiomatic expression that is often used to convey a sense of reckless abandon or thrill-seeking, which is ironic given the context of the conversation.
* **special symbols**: none present in this text.
* **language style**: the language used is casual and conversational, which is consistent with sarcastic tone.
* **cultural background**: the cultural background of the speaker is not explicitly mentioned, but the use of idiomatic expressions and colloquial language suggests a western cultural background.

overall, the text has a tone of playful mockery and irony, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1,"assistant

**punctuation:** the input text contains a period (.) at the end, which is a common punctuation mark used in statements.

**rhetorical devices:** there is no obvious rhetorical device used in the input text, such as irony, understatement, or exaggeration.

**emotional words:** the text doesn't contain any emotional words that would suggest sarcasm, such as ""ridiculous"", ""absurd"", or ""pathetic"".

**topic:** the topic is about rose's reluctance to engage in certain activities, and dorothy's response is encouraging rose to do one of those activities.

**cultural background:** there is no explicit cultural background mentioned in the text.

based on these cues, i would assign a label of **'not sarcastic'** to the input text. the response from dorothy seems genuine and encouraging, without any hint of sarcasm.",0,"assistant

let's extract the cues from the input text:

**cultural background:** none specific, but the reference to niagara falls might be familiar to western cultures.

**language style:** the language used is informal, with a conversational tone.

**emotional words:** none.

considering these cues, i would assign the label:

i'll extract the cues from the input text to classify the label.

**rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""you got off to a really good start"" is a backhanded compliment, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm.

**context:** the conversation is between two characters, scott and member-boy, who were previously discussing something (sarcastic or not). the tone of the conversation seems informal and playful.

**punctuation:** the text doesn't contain any punctuation that would indicate sarcasm, but the phrase itself is written in a way that implies sarcasm.

**cultural background:** the dialogue doesn't contain any cultural references that would affect the interpretation of the text.

**topic:** the topic of the conversation is the group or the start of something, which is unclear.

considering these cues, i would classify the label as:

* special symbols: none
* emotional words: ""really"" (can be used to convey skepticism or incredulity)
* surface emotion: skepticism/incredulity

### analysis:

the use of ""noooo. really?"" is a clear example of verbal irony, where the speaker is expressing the opposite of what they actually mean. the phrase is not a genuine expression of surprise or excitement, but rather a way of saying ""not really"" or ""not surprised"". the emotional tone is one of skepticism or incredulity, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic speech.

**emotional contrasts:** the emotional contrast is between the expected response of ""yes"" or ""i'm having trouble"" and the actual response of ""noooo. really?"", which is a playful and ironic way to respond.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion is playful and ironic, rather than genuine.

**emotional words:** the emotional words are ""noooo"", which is an exaggerated and playful way to respond.

* the context is a conversation between friends, and monica has suddenly stopped doing something (likely talking or doing an activity). chandler is responding to this sudden stop with an offer of a break.

**keywords:**

* ""sorry"", ""break"", ""stop""

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **'not sarcastic'** to the input text. the language is polite and concerned, and there is no evidence of irony, mocking, or mocking tone, which are common characteristics of sarcastic language.",0,"assistant

**common knowledge:** none (the reference to ""the british are coming"" is a famous phrase from american history, but it's not directly relevant to the conversation)

**keywords:** british, coming

**topic:** none (the topic is not explicitly stated, but it seems to be a response to phoebe's question)

**emotional words:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""the british are coming"" is a reference to a famous phrase from american history, but in this context, it's likely being used in a humorous or ironic way, rather than a serious one. this contrast between the original meaning and the intended meaning suggests sarcasm.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the response is likely sarcastic because it's an unexpected and humorous response to phoebe's question, and the phrase ""the british are coming"" is being used in a way that's opposite of its original meaning.",1,"assistant

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i would classify the label as:

**sarcastic**

here's why:

* **emotional contrasts**: the tone of the response is unexpected and playful, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the use of a dramatic and serious phrase (""the british are coming?"") in a casual conversation is an emotional contrast that suggests sarcasm.
* **language style**: the language used is informal and conversational, which is typical of everyday conversations. however, the use of a historical reference (""the british are coming?"") in a modern context is an unusual twist that adds to the sarcastic tone.
* **context**: the context of the conversation is casual and social, which is a common setting for sarcastic remarks.
* **rhetorical devices**: the use of a rhetorical question (""the british are coming?"") is a common device used in sarcasm to convey irony or mocking.
* **cultural background**: the reference to the historical phrase ""the british are coming!"" is a nod to american cultural knowledge, which suggests that the speaker is familiar with the phrase and is using it to make a humorous comment.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the response is intended to be sarcastic and humorous, rather than serious or literal.",1,"assistant

to classify the input text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic', i will extract the following cues:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the surface emotion expressed by chandler is curiosity or inquiry (""the british are coming?""), which is a neutral or positive emotion. there is no apparent emotional contrast with the expected or normal response.
2. **punctuation**: the question mark (?) at the end of the sentence indicates a question, which is a common way to express curiosity or inquiry.
3. **surface emotion**: as mentioned earlier, the surface emotion expressed by chandler is curiosity or inquiry.
4. **common knowledge**: the phrase ""the british are coming"" is a famous quote from the american revolutionary war, which is a well-known historical event. however, in this context, it's being used in a humorous or ironic way.
5. **special symbols**: there are no special symbols in this input text that would indicate sarcasm.

considering these cues, i would classify the input text as:

**label: 'sarcastic'**

the use of the famous quote in a humorous or ironic way, combined with the question mark and the surface emotion of curiosity or inquiry, suggests that chandler is being sarcastic. the phrase ""the british are coming?"" is not a genuine question, but rather a way of expressing irony or humor.",0,1

### input:
monica: oh my god i love that! - really? - no!


### response:
the input text is a dialogue between monica and chandler, where monica initially expresses enthusiasm and affection towards chandler's idea, but then quickly retracts her statement with a ""no!"".


### cues:
- context: the context is a romantic conversation between two people, which is a common setting for sarcastic remarks.
- emotional words: ""love"", ""god"" (although ""god"" is not typically an emotional word, it's used in a way that conveys strong emotion)
- keywords: ""really?"" (a keyword that suggests skepticism or doubt)
- punctuation: the use of an exclamation mark (!) in ""oh my god i love that!"" and a question mark (?) in ""really?"" are typical of enthusiastic and questioning speech, respectively.
- special symbols: the hyphen (-) is used to separate the two parts of monica's response, which could be seen as a transition from enthusiasm to skepticism.

### label:
given the cues, i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text, as monica's initial enthusiasm is quickly replaced with a strong negation (""no!""), which is a classic characteristic of sarcasm.",1,"assistant

**common knowledge:** road signs, especially ""merge"" signs, are a common feature in everyday life.

**rhetorical devices:** the use of irony (chandler's suggestion to hang a ""merge"" sign over the bed, implying a romantic relationship) is a key rhetorical device in this conversation.

**topic:** the topic is chandler's humorous suggestion to hang a ""merge"" sign over the bed.

**surface emotion:** monica's initial response, ""oh my god i love that!"", suggests excitement and enthusiasm, while her subsequent response, ""no!"", reveals her true feelings, which are likely to be annoyance or frustration.

**cultural background:** the conversation is set in a western cultural context, likely in the united states, given the reference to road signs and the style of humor.

**label:** **sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because monica's initial response is a classic example of sarcasm, where she pretends to be enthusiastic about chandler's suggestion, only to reveal her true feelings in her subsequent response.",1,"assistant

**topic:** the topic is a conversation between friends, specifically about a road sign idea.

**special symbols:** none

**cultural background:** american, likely from the tv show friends

**context:** the context is a casual conversation between friends, with monica expressing initial excitement and then rejecting the idea.

**emotional words:** ""love"", ""no!""

**label:** **sarcastic**

the label is ""sarcastic"" because monica's initial ""oh my god i love that!"" is likely an exaggeration and not a genuine expression of love for the idea. her quick follow-up ""really?"" and then ""no!"" indicate that she is being sarcastic, implying that she doesn't actually love the idea at all.",1,1

* **cultural background:** american (assuming the characters are from friends tv show)
* **common knowledge:** knitting pot holders is a common household activity, ""no thanks"" is a common phrase used to decline an invitation

**label:** **sarcastic**

reasoning: the response ""no thanks josephine!"" is likely sarcastic because it's an unexpected and humorous reaction to the invitation to knit pot holders. the use of the full name ""josephine"" instead of the nickname ""joey"" adds to the sarcastic tone.",1,"assistant

**context:** the context is a conversation between friends, where chandler is responding to an invitation to join an activity. the tone of the conversation is casual and playful.

based on these cues, i would assign the label: **sarcastic**

the response ""no thanks josephine!"" is likely sarcastic because chandler is declining the invitation, but the tone is playful and teasing, implying that he's not really interested in knitting pot holders. the use of the formal title ""josephine"" instead of the usual ""joey"" is also a hint at the sarcasm.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

**language style:** the language used is informal, with a casual tone and a lack of formalities (e.g., ""hey chandler!"", ""no thanks josephine!"").

**keywords:** ""no thanks"" is a phrase often used to express rejection or refusal, which is a common keyword in sarcastic responses.

**common knowledge:** the context is a social setting where people are engaging in a casual activity (knitting pot holders), and chandler's response is unexpected and unexpected in this setting.

### label:
based on the cues extracted, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the tone of chandler's response, particularly the use of ""no thanks josephine!"", suggests that he is being sarcastic and uninterested in joining the activity.",1,1

**cultural background:** the text doesn't provide any specific cultural background information.

**special symbols:** none.

**topic:** the topic appears to be chandler's enjoyment of food or dessert.

**punctuation:** the text uses standard punctuation (periods and commas) with no unusual or ironic uses.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **'sarcastic'** to the input text. the emotional contrast between the initial enthusiasm and the unexpected mention of the balcony and desert suggests that chandler might be being sarcastic, implying that the food is not that great after all.",1,"assistant

**cultural background:** the conversation is set in a western cultural context, likely in the united states.

**emotional words:** ""good"", ""enjoy"", ""relax""

considering these cues, i would assign the label:

* emotional words: the phrase ""struck down in the prime of life"" contains the word ""struck"", which implies a sense of sudden and dramatic loss, conveying a sense of drama and irony.
* cultural background: the text appears to be from a western cultural background, specifically american, given the use of idiomatic expressions and the context of the conversation.
* language style: the language style is informal, with a tone that is playful and humorous, which is consistent with the character of chandler from the tv show friends.

**sarcastic**

the tone of the conversation suggests that chandler is being facetious and ironic, and his response is likely meant to be humorous and playful. the use of the phrase ""but that happens everyday"" is a clear indication of sarcasm, as it is an exaggeration and an obvious attempt to downplay the significance of the proposal.",1,"assistant

after analyzing the input text, i've extracted the following cues:

**special symbols:** none

**emotional contrasts:** the speaker, chandler, is downplaying his emotions by saying ""i am not freaking out"", but his words and tone suggest that he is indeed upset or surprised by the sudden proposal.

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be one of calmness and rationality, as chandler is trying to reassure monica that he's not freaking out.

**language style:** the language used is informal and conversational, with a touch of irony and understatement.

**rhetorical devices:**

* **understatement:** chandler is downplaying the significance of hildy's proposal by saying it's a normal occurrence, which is likely an exaggeration.
* **irony:** the phrase ""but that happens everyday"" is ironic because it's unlikely that a random woman would propose to someone they don't know, and it's certainly not a common occurrence in chandler's life.

considering these cues, i would assign a label of **sarcastic** to the input text. chandler's tone and language suggest that he's being facetious and humorous, rather than genuinely calm and rational.",1,1

based on the input text, i will extract the cues to classify the text as either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'.

**rhetorical devices:**

* irony: the phrase ""excited about the party she knows is happening"" is ironic because the party is actually happening, but the speaker is implying that the birthday girl is not excited about it.

**special symbols:**

* none

**punctuation:**

* periods (.) at the end of the sentence

**language style:**

* the language is casual and conversational, which is typical of spoken dialogue.

**emotional words:**

* none

considering these cues, i would assign the label:

**sarcastic**

the tone of the text is clearly sarcastic, as chandler is implying that the birthday girl is not excited about the party, which is unlikely given that it's her birthday. the use of irony and the casual language style further support this classification.",0,"assistant

### extracted cues:

* common knowledge: the context is a birthday party, which is a common and relatable scenario.
* punctuation: the sentence ends with a period (.) which indicates a statement rather than a question or an exclamation.
* emotional words: the word ""excited"" is used, which is an emotional word, but it's used in a way that contradicts the expected excitement for a birthday party.
* language style: the sentence is written in a casual and conversational tone, which is typical of everyday speech.
* context: the context is a conversation between friends, which is a social and informal setting.

### analysis:

the sentence is written in a way that implies the opposite of what is expected. the phrase ""she knows is happening"" suggests that the birthday girl is aware of the party, but the tone of the sentence is dismissive and sarcastic. the use of ""oh sure"" at the beginning of the sentence is also a giveaway of sarcasm.

considering these cues, i assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of the statement is clearly sarcastic, as chandler is implying that the birthday girl is not excited about the party, which is the opposite of what one would expect. the use of ""oh sure"" and the phrase ""she knows is happening"" are also indicators of sarcasm.",0,0

**cues extraction:**

* **emotional contrasts:** none
* **special symbols:** none
* **cultural background:** none (assuming a generic western cultural background)
* **rhetorical devices:** irony (chandler's question is unlikely to be genuine, given the context)
* **common knowledge:** the conversation is taking place in the year 2020, and chandler's friend emma is mentioned, implying a prior conversation or relationship

**label:** **sarcastic**

the label is assigned based on the use of irony in chandler's question, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcastic language. the question is unlikely to be genuine, and the tone is playful and mocking, indicating sarcasm.",1,"assistant

### extraction of cues:

* **keywords:** ""are you still enjoying your nap?"" (the question itself is neutral, but the context and tone can indicate sarcasm)
* **context:** the conversation is between ross and chandler, and chandler's previous statement was ""hi emma, it's the year 2020"" (this suggests that chandler is trying to make a joke or be ironic)
* **emotional contrasts:** the question seems to be asking about someone's enjoyment of a nap, which is a mundane and ordinary activity. the contrast between the normalcy of the activity and the unexpectedness of the question (especially considering chandler's previous statement) could indicate sarcasm.
* **cultural background:** the conversation is set in a modern american context, which is neutral for sarcasm detection.
* **rhetorical devices:** the question is a rhetorical one, as chandler is unlikely to be genuinely interested in emma's (who is not present in the conversation) nap. this could be a sign of sarcasm.

based on the input text, i will extract the following cues:

* rhetorical devices: the question ""are you still enjoying your nap?"" is a rhetorical question, as it is unlikely that emma is actually still sleeping and chandler is seeking a genuine answer. this type of question is often used to express sarcasm.
* keywords: the word ""nap"" is a key word that suggests the speaker is being sarcastic. a nap is typically a short period of sleep, and chandler's question implies that emma has been sleeping for a long time, which is unlikely.
* emotional contrasts: the tone of the question is playful and lighthearted, which contrasts with the expectation of a serious or concerned tone if chandler were genuinely asking about emma's sleep.
* common knowledge: the context of the conversation, including the characters' personalities and the fact that it's the year 2020, suggests that chandler is being sarcastic. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, and emma is not likely to be sleeping for an extended period of time.
