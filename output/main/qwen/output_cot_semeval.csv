step 1: surface sentiment:

the words used in the sentence are quite positive: 'classy', 'never trashy', 'just a little sassy'. these are generally considered to be positive statements and imply that the subject is presenting oneself or some situation as desirable.

step 2: true intention:

the apparent use of these words could be revealing the speaker's true intention of pointing out some underlying contrast or unspoken reality in appearance or behavior.",1

the tone is rather casual and neutral given the use of `@tagged_user` and what seems to be ordinary greetings (`you know that, how you doing??`).

the user poses a general question to `@bigedh456` as if genuinely interested in their well-being. the friendly, conversational style of the message doesn't suggest any particular irony or",0

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment could be deduced as an instruction or advice, likely to be taken seriously.

step 2: however, observing the hashtag ""#not"" added at the end, it serves as a signal that the intended meaning is opposite to the literal advice, suggesting that looking like a badass by having drama on social media is undesirable.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment - in this case, the keywords and phrase ""how dare"" could indicate a tone of disbelief or surprise that might sometimes carry a negative connotation or hint towards sarcasm. however, the majority of the text, particularly ""intelligent conversation about race,"" seems to possess a predominantly positive sentiment as it implies respect for the subject matter being discussed.

### detailed thought process:

step 1: the surface sentiment of this text, taken at face value, seems to encourage the implication that if a place is open all night, one should stay all night. there's a straightforward, supportive feel to the statement.

step 2: when paying attention to the language style and context, the sentence is addressed as ""@laurenbailes"" and follows speculations or questions (""i think... if...""). this, combined with the",1

looking at the sentence 'planning a vacation instead of studying.... my priorities are in line.', the keywords 'vacation', 'studying', and 'priorities are in line' give the impression of a positive and perhaps humorous sentiment. the tone of the sentence appears轻松 and self-aware.

step 2: the true intention
upon closer inspection, the phrase 'my priorities are in line' might be",0

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment is one of strong, highly positive emotions as the individual claims that the music is for the people and not for the money, reflecting a desire to create something genuine and without the selfish motive of financial gain. emotions like ""peace and love"" further suggest a sentimental or positively charged sentiment.

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral due to the keywords ""free"" and ""#freebiebookdownload"", which seem to suggest a positive intent or outcome.

step 2: analyzing the sentence structure and noting the use of hashtags others than typical hashtags providing information (""#pets""), it can be deduced that the true intention is more likely to be ironic, possibly implying that the user dislikes or finds this offer of free pets/animals books useless.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment is positive. the emojis displayed ('😊') indicate a happy or positive sentiment.

step 2: the sentence structure seems odd. the phrase ""i just love being ignored"" is used, which is usually associated with sarcasm since being ignored is generally not a desirable situation. also, the emoji '[#notㅐ العن)' seems to imply a twist on the initial positive sentiment, providing a hint for sarcasm.

step 1: the surface sentiment here is negative, because it is indicating that one star should be given to someone's criticism due to poor grammar.

upon analyzing the given text ""@theoliverstone after 1989, why did nato need to expand?"", we proceed in the following steps:

step 1: deliberate on the surface sentiment
- this appears to be a straightforward question asking for an explanation without any direct indicators of sarcasm. keywords like ""need"" and ""expand"" indicate a curious and factual inquiry. therefore, the surface sentiment seems to not contain any sarcasm or irony.

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment is positive. the text contains sentimentality, with the user wishing for their mum to be back with them for christmas and the use of the festive christmas emoji. this typically indicates a positive or hopeful sentiment.

step 2: the user's wording implies that they are wishing for something that is probably not occurring in reality, possibly due to their mum not being with them during christmas, thereby adding a twist of irony.",1

step 2: cheap sarcasm can be detected by understanding that ""putting journalism first"" extends the pride much further than it needs to. it's highly unlikely that an ad service would cut to ads during primetime for the public's good in support of journalism, invest significantly in content, and",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text involves the use of the hashtag ""#thanksobama"" after mentioning that the user just paid $2.59 for gas. depending on the political climate, this could be interpreted as a claim that gas is very cheap, suggesting a positive attitude towards the prices, even humorously playfully thanking obama (who was a us president noted for his efforts on reducing petrol prices or an assumed opposition figure).",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment is positive. keywords such as 'most welcome' and ':d' (which usually signifies happiness or laughter) combine for a positive impression being given.

step 2: the phrase 'you are most welcome!' is a cliché expression that's often used at the end of messages to indicate politeness. typically, it's genuinely delivered. however, in such a context ('loved the post'), it doesn't align",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is set by the emojis, exclamation marks, and the phrase ""can't take my eyes off you"", which is usually used to express admiration or infatuation. the outreaching hand or ""can't help but"" expresses a form of obsession or strong liking towards someone or something.

### explanation:

**step 1:** the surface sentiment
upon a superficial look at the text, it seems the tone is enthusiastic, with words like ""can't say no to that"" and phrases like ""we can do this."" the hashtags like #coyq (which stands for 'come on, you') further support a positive and encouraging tone. there are no obvious keywords or emojis that indicate sarcasm or irony in casual internet language such as 'rolling eyes",1

### explanation:

step 1: surface sentiment
the post selects the keyword ""the turkey song"" by '@dickiestickhead' and mentions an initiative, ""#makeitaclassic"", paired with hashtags such as #thanksgiving. the use of emojis and capitalization might suggest a promotional or enthusiastic tone.

step 2: true intention

step 1: analyzing the surface sentiment
the words 'just ranted on', 'hit send', and 'my ipod just died' seem to suggest that the user was about to send a rant, which indicates frustration or annoyance. the hashtags '#greatmorning' and '#not' might seem like conflicting sentiment indicators.

### explanation:

step 1: surface sentiment: the text contains keywords such as ""convinced"" and ""protect them"" which generally imply a positive sentiment, either sincerity or genuine intentions.

step 2: the sentence is written in a context where @beckie0 is presumably discussing trichotillomania, a condition associated with pulling out one's hair uncontrollably. using the keyword ""helps"" in close context to her vlogging about this topic brings a tone of sarcasm",1

### reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment is neutral but the tone of the text suggests a certain level of frustration or sarcasm due to the hashtags like #lottoclub, #bankopen, #doumenturdeposit which indicate the speaker thinks they are being penalized for doing normal activities despite being apprehended for some sort of legal mix-up or misunderstanding (#not criminal).

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment - the input text uses sarcasm indicators such as the hashtag #sarcasm and mentions of a christmas tree, @robertashton1, and a hyperlink with an ""@"" user in it. the ellipsis at the end (""..."") could also suggest some form of drama or exaggeration. all these elements contribute to the impression of a potentially sarcastic tone.

the words ""actually"" and ""wasn't"" are used initially to negate the expectations or presumptions that could have been projected. in terms of emojis, this text doesn't provide any instigating visual cues toward sarcasm.

### analysis:

step 1: surprisingly, the surface sentiment of the text does not include strong indications of either sarcasm or irony. it reads as a straightforward statement referencing a report discussing alleged non-involvement of al-qaeda in the 9/11 attacks, possibly with an indirect link to recent events (#congressional #report and #torture).

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is humorous or lighthearted, as indicated by the hashtags #sarcasm and ""funny."" the text seems to be entertaining or teasing the idea that certain tasks at work get accomplished when someone is on their off week.

step 2: the sentence ""also it is funny how things at work get done when i'm on my off week"" is phrased in a seemingly positive and somewhat enthusiastic tone",1

step 2: the true intention of the sentence can be deduced as someone asking whether the content from a user named @vincentlaforet is a recent release. given the style of asking and lack of any more context, the inner meaning doesn't heavily suggest a contrasting or humorous tone that is common in sarcasm.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment from the text indicates distress or frustration, evident through the excessive use of 😫 emojis.

step 2: the user mentions that the vine (presumably a link to a video) won't come up. when paired with the emojis and exclamation indicating distress, this could allude to the frustration of repeatedly clicking on the link but not getting any result, suggesting a technical issue with the link.

step 1: surface sentiment can be determined by keywords such as ""hyper at 1am"" and emojis such as ""ohwhale 🐋🐳"" which typically indicate playfulness or exaggeration. the use of hashtags like ""#ohwhale"" also suggests a light-hearted tone.

step 2: the phrase ""when i really should be getting rest"" directly contradicts the initial excitement conveyed by the word hyper. this indicates the text is likely",1

step 1: the surface sentiment seems positive with words like ""together we can save lives"" typically inspiring a sense of unity and altruism.

step 2: however, the true intention is to make a criticism or remark on the discrepancy between the promotional message of the american red cross and the less virtuous act of the driver smoking, which goes against the message of the van. this falls under a 'meet expectation' or inverted rhetoric -",1

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it seems there's a clear twist",1

### explanation:
step 1: surface sentiment
the words ""just entered the @bbcstrictly competition for tickets to the final!"" might seem hopeful and positive, with ""fingers crossed"" subtly suggesting a hopeful anticipation.

step 2: true intention
however, the context indicates that competition for the tickets to the strictly come dancing final might be very tough. therefore, the sentence takes a sarcastic turn: it is quite unlikely that the speaker would get the tickets",1

step 2: the phrase ""down faced dog dinner"" appears to be using culinary interpretation of a yoga pose as a play on the traditional christmas dish, a play on words that is a common rhetorical device, but potentially humorous rather than sarcastic in its context.

### explanation:

let's follow the instructions step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment - keywords like ""😭😭"" indicate sadness or discontent, so this is a straightforward clue.
step 2: truth behind words - the user mentions having a game ""monday, tuesday, friday, and saturday"". this statement in its literal sense is likely not expressing despair if one enjoys playing games, as they note that there may be days when they can play.

- sentimental phrases like ""lovehim"" indicate a strong positive",1

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is somewhat fearful or scared, as indicated by the words ""freaks me out"".

step 2: however, the sentence structure and language used, particularly starting with ""looking at the stairs & imaging that scary dark creature coming up"", suggest a more playful, exaggerated fear or a desire to express a heightened feeling of being scared, rather than conveying a real, intense fear.

### analysis:

step 1: on the surface level, the sentence indicates that the speaker has scoped out a new route for a 5k, which generally implies excitement or enthusiasm at the prospect of running. this is highlighted by emojis of laughter and the hashtag ""#not..."", which is meant to counteract the preceding statement in a humorous manner. the choice of word 'scoped out' often has a secretive, stealthy connotation, which could imply the speaker is avoiding the",1

step 1: the surface sentiment seems straightforward and serious based on the keywords mentioned. the user focuses on the statistics regarding drug-related crimes, and there's a statement about gun crimes too, butwarns that more people are in prison because of drug-related crimes, without any indication of sarcasm from the use of this information alone.

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be ironic, indicated by the phrase '*scoffs humble pie*', especially when it follows '*apologies*'. 'scoffing' here can often be a display of mocking disbelief.

step 1: the sentence contains keywords like ""missed a lot this year"", which suggest a negative sentiment and frustration over not being able to participate in activities. the sentence also has an emoji after the shoulder-related phrase, which could be intended to convey a lighter tone. additionally, there's a definitive ending for 2015 and a declaration of hope for better things in the future, which might imply that the current situation isn't going as well as desired,",1

### step 1: surface sentiment

the surface sentiment seems quite positive or neutral, as it involves phrases like ""love"" and ""peace"", which are commonly associated with positive emotions.

### step 2: true intention

the user seems to have a contrasting intention, where they are potentially mocking or criticizing the context carried by the phrases. especially, sharing a link that contradicts the theme of the hashtags might suggest a sarcastic intent. the phrase ""goes both ways",1

### explanation:

step 1: surface sentiment
judging from the words and emojis used, the surface sentiment appears to be one of self-acceptance. keywords like ""not perfect,"" ""not the most beautiful,"" and ""#women #not #perfet"" indicate a tone that seems to embrace imperfection and inclusivity.

### response:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is a mix of amusement and friendly communication, indicated by the keyword ""great!"", and the use of the happy, laughing emoji "": d"".

step 2: considering the context provided by hashtags ""#not just for girls"", the sentence appears to be commenting on a masculine interest (driving a classic car) and catching amusement in the novelty or perceived surprise of others (the exclamation marks and colons)",1
