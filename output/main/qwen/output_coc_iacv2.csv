### response:

step 1: surface sentiment appears to be informative and matter-of-fact, as the text discusses the development of infants and the behavior of three-year-olds. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony.

step 2: the true intention underlying the text is to provide insight into the cognitive and emotional development stages of young children, possibly as part of a discussion or article on child psychology or developmental stages.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment is quite serious and critical. the text complains about the faults of the judicial system and the problems with the death penalty, advocating for a perfect system. the lack of emojis also suggests a serious tone.

### step-by-step reasoning:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the surface sentiment seems to be questioning the hypocrisy of someone making an argument about gun laws in california, particularly if they themselves are uncertain about these laws. this is indicated by phrases like ""you yourself said"" and ""don't even know... yet"" which imply an element of surprise or disbelief.

**step 2: true intention**

step 2: the true intention involves identifying any implied mocking or irony in the text. by providing the link to arn.org with the claim that ""here's what i told him"",",1

step 1: the surface sentiment
the sentence appears to be a complaint with a tone of frustration and perhaps sarcasm. the frequent use of strong words like 'duped', 'christmas', and the repeated request 'name one' could indicate a hint of exaggeration or sarcasm.

step 2: true intent and rhetorical devices

### response:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems to be quite critical and analytical, driven by the use of strong words like ""much wrong,"" ""ignoring the grammar emoticonxrolleyes,"" ""redundant prohibitions,"" among others. these suggest frustration, detachment, or annoyance.

step 2: however, the true intention of the text reveals a more nuanced stance; it seems to be an argument against overly broad interpretations of",1

step 1: the surface sentiment seems neutral or negative (""so what?"" indicates mild annoyance or indifference), not explicitly positive or critical.

the text appears to express some form of criticism or disbelief directed towards the claim that gay rights and polygamy are connected. the tone seems serious and may hint at a tone of frustration or exasperation.

upon closer examination, the speaker is not genuinely concerned about the absence of an explanation connecting gay rights and polygamy. instead, the speaker is using a rhetorical question and",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems calm and objective. keywords such as ""recognizes"", ""allows"", ""suits"", and ""everyone"" suggest a neutral and inclusive tone. there are no strong emotional or exaggerated language clues.

step 2: upon deeper deduction, the sentence structure and tone actually create a dissonance between surface-level politeness and a deeper critical point. the part about challenging ""a practice which excludes certain individuals"" suggests",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of this text seems to not be sarcastic. words like ""afraid"" and ""i created you so that you would think you created me"" suggest a sincere tone that aims to convey that the speaker is amused by manipulating the listener's self-perception.

step 2: however, deeper analysis reveals that the speaker is patronizing, using a series of rhetorical devices such as dramatic irony (""i created you so that you",1

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text doesn't smack of negativity or humor, the author seems to be presenting a well-reasoned argument. english phrases like ""basic tools"", ""same pressures"" and a genuine question about the evolution of human beings don't suggest sarcasm as of this moment. so, the surface sentiment could be interpreted as being analytical.

step 2: however, the sentence structure and the use of formal language, accents on seemingly stark realities (e.g., ""thousands or millions of blacks"" and ""justifying linching""), actually create an image of holiness and righteousness when discussing such dark historical subjects. the use of commas and ""i suppose",1

step 2: however, when the sentence is examined more closely, the selection of words like ""all that new"" and ""have to admit"" suggest the opposite of the initial neutral tone, implying that the speaker might actually find the idea of a lack of knowledge impressive or surprising in a way that",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be preachy regarding religious beliefs and morals. keywords like ""hell"", ""commit suicide"", ""lying"", ""christian"", ""gay"", ""scripture"", and ""masturbate"" along with the repetition of criticisms (""where is your reference"", ""once again, reference please"") suggest a heated, perhaps officious, tone.

the text structure, phrasing, and context suggest a serious, thoughtful, and slightly technical tone. keywords such as ""favoring incorporation,"" ""privileges and immunities,"" ""reasonableness,"" and ""substantive due process"" align with a lawful or legal discourse. there are no obvious signs of sarcasm or irony, such as emojis or over-the-top humor.

upon reading the text, the use of phrases like ""the enemy"" and the context of debating evolution create an overall tone that suggests a serious discussion on the role of thinking in debates about creationism. initially, there could be a slight implication of either frustration or agreement with the statement.

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment is questioning and doubtful, with keywords like ""wasn't that your boy, clinton, that screwed the intern?"", which seems curious or uncertain about historical events. the emoticon used also indicates a negative sentiment or disbelief.

step 2: the true intention likely lies in the mockery or irony towards political figures and their relationships, which can be deduced from comparing the known actions of the individuals mentioned. this question is being",1

step 1: the surface sentiment can initially be perceived as surprising or amused, considering the context is referring to a particular stance on a subject (pommy bashing) in a light-hearted or teasing manner. the one using this sentence seems to know or suspect that the target of their question might not usually have a negative view towards a particular group or subject, which indicates a slight surprise or amusement.

step 1: based on the surface sentiment of the text, there is anger and frustration towards the concept of teaching kids about gay rights and marriage against their parents' wishes. keywords like ""against their parents wishes"" and ""don't give a rat's xxx"" indicate anger, while the repetition of ""you"" suggests hostility towards the perceived speaker or those practicing this form of teaching.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is one of commanding or requesting ability. keywords like ""can call in an airstrike bombing"" and ""all while wearing camouflage fatigues"" suggest the speaker is describing capabilities of someone in a certain role (perhaps a military personnel). there are no clear negative or jocular emojis or sentiments in the text.

step 2: the true intention of the text seems to be acknowledging the duties and skills of someone",1

step 2: analyzing the sentence more carefully, it claims that all people have a bias, which is presented as a fact. this could be perceived as a tactful way to acknowledge their own bias without admitting to it directly.

step 1: the表面上 sentiment of the text is negative as it criticizes ""those kooks"" for defending the rights of the unborn fetus, using phrases like ""how dare"" to express disapproval.

step 2: however, the true intention behind the text seems to contradict its surface sentiment. the author is mocking the idea of preventing abortions by praising the practice of forcibly removing unborn fetuses from pregnant women. the text is not genuinely supporting abortion rights",1

step 1: the surface sentiment
the text contains a rhetorical question - 'sounds like someone could be lying...hmmm who could it be?' this often suggests a heightened sense of intrigue and might make the reader wonder who could be the liar. lastly, the emoticon xic could also contribute to the sentiment by possibly adding a hint of playfulness.

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be negative, with phrases like ""failure"" and ""miserey"" suggesting dissatisfaction or disappointment.

step 1: the surface sentiment seems positive, with the speaker encouraging others to invest in their 401g and 401a plans, using a somewhat effusive tone highlighted by smiley emojis.  

step 2: upon closer inspection, the use of ""sensible folks"" might suggest a jest or exaggeration, given that investing in retirement plans is often considered sensible advice, which counterbalances the usual emphasis on sensible behavior.

### response:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems quite sarcastic. 'satan' and 'not ours' could suggest a ironic or mocking tone, considering one wouldn't usually name a religious symbol as one's 'daddy' in everyday conversation.

step 2: the true intention appears to be calling out or criticizing a particular assertion instead of being a direct, literal proclamation. the use of john 8:44 outside of doctrinal teachings often indicates a",1

### explanation:

step 1: on the surface, the sentiment of the text is enthusiastic and somewhat philosophical. keywords like ""greater than himself"" and ""look to"" suggest thoughtful contemplation or pride in human achievement.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems quite negative, with phrases like ""mangling of jesus's teachings"", ""lying about what i've said"", and ""standard stuff, nothing to compare"" that suggest disapproval or critique.

step 2: the true intention of the text can be deduced through a careful analysis of the sentence structure and choice of words. the specific use of ""entertaining"" following the mangle of jesus's teachings",1

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is one of exaggeration or absurdity. the phrase ""only has the color red in it"" is a direct contradiction to the visual description of a rainbow which contains a range of colors, suggesting the speaker is purposely distorting the description for emphasis or comedic effect.

step 2: when analyzing the true intention, the sentence is asserting that comparing something to a rainbow and then dismissing or limiting the complexity of that comparison to just",1

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be one of strong disapproval and incredulity. keywords such as ""can't believe,"" ""insane assertion,"" and an emoticon of shaking eyes all contribute to this sentiment.

step 2: on closer inspection, the text appears to be using rhetorical devices - it might be mirroring the way someone would passionately argue for an extreme point of view, while actually holding the opposite opinion. the speaker is making it seem like",1
