cultural background: refers to #starbucks, a well-known international coffee brand, which might evoke familiarity or routine for some individuals but surprise or irony for others.

to extract cues for sarcasm classification, let's analyze the input text step-by-step:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the phrase ""not gonna win"" implies a negative outcome, yet it's presented in a way that suggests the opposite of losing. this creates a contrast in emotion.

### surface emotion: negative (as indicated by #not gonna win)

### emotional words: negative (not), ironic (win)

### response:

the input text contains a link and the hashtag ""#not gonna win"", which contrasts with the actual outcome referenced by the link or the expectation it might imply. this emotional contrast is a common rhetorical device in sarcasm where the opposite of what is stated or expected is implied.

this text is an example of sarcasm, as it flips the meaning of the term ""weirdo"" which is generally used in a non-liking way, in a positive manner by using a sarcastic tone. the context indirectly compliments the subject by negating the common negative perception embedded in the term 'weirdo'. therefore, in terms of common knowledge, the sentence structure (keyword 'exactly') aligns with the typical pattern of sarcastic statements, which usually",1,"### response:

1. **surface emotion:** the words ""thanks for sharing"" can be seen as a polite response or acknowledgment, often aligned with genuinely shared feelings.

2. **cultural background:** there is no cultural background evident in the text, as it is a straightforward interaction related to sharing information about an individual.

3. **topic:** the topic",0,"### response:

the input text contains cues such as mentioning a real-life health condition in an unexpected context (""jamie grace has tourette's?""), the use of a rhetorical device in ""re:"", and an emotional word ("" tribute ""). it also includes punctuation such as period and exclamation mark to create emphasis. the topic seems to be a response about acknowledging and appreciating a young gospel singer. considering these cues, the label for this text would be:

### label: sarcastic",1,"### response: 

the input text uses the rhetorical device of irony to contrast a negative emotional state ( fearing of passing out on the job) with a very specific and exaggerated job description (""crazy 11-2 shift""). the topic is about work duty while the context involves an employment scenario where unexpected long work hours might cause physical or psychological strain. the use of hashtags like #sarcasm highlights its intention as a signal of possible sarcasm. there's no requirement for common knowledge to understand",1,"### cues:

  * **surface emotion**: the surface emotion conveyed in this sentence is evident through the phrase ""i might pass out on the job!"" which implies that the speaker either dislikes their shift or finds it too challenging. it adds a layer of seriousness and intent of complaining which is usually expected while dealing with responsibilities at work. however, the accompanying hashtag ""#sarcasm"" serves as a clear indication that the speaker’s level of concern is exaggerated for a comedic effect.

explanation:

- **punctuation** - the use of smiley face emojis (😊) right before the word ""love"" suggests a contrast with what words like ""i love"" typically mean, and hints that this is sarcastic.

the input text uses specific cues that commonly indicate sarcasm:

1. **punctuation**: the use of all capital letters in ""not"" at the end of the sentence serves as a aside, a rhetorical device in which the speaker addresses an absent character. this is often used sarcastically as it can imply that the speaker is surprised that ""the trickle down fairy will do the rest"" is not a viable solution.

the input text contains special symbols (#) and hashtags, which are commonly used on social media platforms. there is also a deliberate negation of belief (""#not"") that could suggest sarcasm. however, given the context of the text (promoting economic growth), the sarcasm might not be immediately obvious without prior knowledge of a 'trickle down fairy' being used in a mockery or exaggerated sense.

- **common knowledge**: the topic being referred to—""presentation on structurally deficient bridges""—is related to work or professional life. the phrase ""exciting"" in the context of a presentation might typically be used in a positive or enthusiastic way, but is used ironically here, suggesting that there is nothing exciting or enjoyable about attending such a presentation.

1. **cultural background**: the user mentions ""mozart,"" which refers to a famous austrian composer. this is a classic reference that could indicate a knowledge or appreciation from a western cultural background.
   
2. **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs irony and surprise, suggesting something unexpected or unusual in the context it's being presented (mentioning ""he was in mozart"" in a surprising way).

this text uses a sarcastic tone by making a contrast between the prestigious field of mozart (implied with the logical expectation that a person named yu or yoshio might be involved) and the seemingly unrelated or lower-culture context (""inoue yoshio"" being with ""shirota yu""). the sarcasm is further emphasized by the ironic inclusion of ""apparently"", creating a rhetorical tension that anticipates the punchline or the exaggeration of the truth.

cues extracted:
- emotional contrasts: the phrase 'some days are just better than others' suggests a contrast between positive and negative emotions.
- surface emotion: the surface emotion seems to be a hint of resignation or acceptance, as if acknowledging the presence of both good and bad days.
- topic: the topic discussed is about the variability of days in terms of emotional state.

cultural background refers to the social norms, values, and behaviors of a particular group or society. in this input, there is no specific cultural reference that suggests sarcasm.

emotional contrasts involve a situation where words or actions reflect different emotions from what is expected. the phrase ""some days are just better than others"" could be seen as a contrast in happiness or satisfaction from one day to the next. however, without additional context or tone, it might not necessarily indicate sarcasm",1,1

the input text uses a combination of exaggerated emojis (`😎😎😂😂`) to emphasize the statement, indicating that the statement might not be taken at face value. the language style is casual and possibly humorous.

cultural background: the reference to ""ladies"" and the inclusion of emojis like muscle icons and laughing faces suggest a context targeting a predominantly western audience, possibly gender-focused or related to online communities like social media platforms where such aesthetics and humor are common.

rhetorical devices: the use of multiple laughing emojis and the contrasting claim of ""take a look at those calves!!! 😎😎"" with ""ladies love the calves!"" employ rhetorical exaggeration for comedic effect.

1. **context**: there's no direct context given, so it's hard to pinpoint a situation that would suggest sarcasm. assumptions are based solely on the statement and the tone of the emojis.

the input text contains several cues that can be used to determine sarcasm:

1. **surface emotion**: the hashtag #not following ""loveeee"" suggests a contrast in feeling, indicating that the speaker may not actually feel the way the word 'loveeee' would imply.

### label: sarcastic",0,"### response: 

to analyze this text for sarcasm classification, let's examine the cues provided:

1. **emotional words:** the text does not contain any direct emotional words, hence no clear indication of sarcasm or not.

2. **language style:** 
   - the use of ""#"" symbol followed by ""not"" suggests a specific, flat tone suggesting denial or contrary expectation. this could potentially hint at sarcasm. people often say ""#not"" sarcastically when they are doing the opposite",1,"### response: 
the input text contains a hashtag ""#not"" which is often used in sarcastic statements to negate the following content, and there is a link ""http://t.co/1bfosiwni5"" suggesting an ironic tone. however, without a full sentence structure or context, it's hard to determine sarcasm based on punctuation alone. the text seems to imply that there is an update about clash, but by mentioning the negation ""#not"", it suggests the opposite",1,1

- **context**: the text seems to be referring to a moment of reflection or realization related to the holiday season, specifically the idea of having presents under the christmas tree.
- **special symbols**: there are no special symbols evident in this sentence.
- **language style**: the language style appears to be personal and somewhat nostalgic or reflective, possibly tinged with a hint of sarcasm through the slightly ironic attempt to ""move back in.""

#### cues:
- **context:** the context here mentions a sad realization about being past the age where one typically has many presents on christmas, which is symbolic of loneliness or a decline in one's status or lifestyle according to cultural norms.

the use of the term ""alone"" as a contrast to the situation where @theandrewe is ""in hereford"" but unable to leave suggests an emotional contrast, indicating that @theandreww might be feeling weighed down or restricted by the situation. the phrase ""but can't leave bambino alone!"" contains a seemingly contradictory request, implying that there might be an underlying miscommunication or misunderstanding in context, which is another cue for interpreting the text as sarcastic. therefore,",1,"### response:

the input text contains a mix of casual language style typical of social media posts, with an ""@"" sign indicating a mention to another user, suggesting a conversation context. it also implies a request or statement that might be more polite in seriousness (""but can't leave bambino alone"" could be interpreted as a gentle reproach), which is at odds with the typical usage of sarcasm for humorous effects.

in the given input text, several cues help us classify whether the content is sarcastic or not. firstly, the term ""what the hell"" used in a question format could be an element of rhetorical device aiming to express frustration or shock. also, the phrase ""'left alone more bouncers than played,"" suggests using exaggerated language in a contradictory context, making it difficult to gauge the true sentiment. the use of ""'got a review right"" echoes the humorous irony, known as",1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues that can help in determining whether it is sarcastic or not:

1. **context**: the text discusses a named person, shahid afridi, in a sports context. shahid afridi is a pakistani cricketer, suggesting context is related to sports or cricket.

2. **emotional words**: there is no overtly strong emotion-expressing word directly suggesting sarcasm; however, the chaotic sentence structure (""what the hell has happened",1,"### response: 

emotional contrasts: the use of phrases like ""what the hell"" creates a contrast between surprise and frustration. the phrase ""got a review right"" also highlights a contrast, indicating a small positive moment in an otherwise negative context.

emotional words: ""what the hell"", ""left alone"", ""more bouncers than played"" and ""got a review right"" are emotional words. these words carry strong feelings that point towards sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1,"label: sarcastic

### explanation:

1. **special symbols**: the use of multiple hash symbols (`#`) combined with the exclamation mark and curse word ""fucking"" form a cascade of special symbols and expletives which creates a tone that deviates from the norm, encoding emotional intensity.

2. **common knowledge**: using ""just gave up"" to describe a car dying is a common event that can cause frustration or annoyance. however, the description is presented so matter-of-f",1,"### response:

cues:
- punctuation: exclamation mark after ""fucking car"" suggests emphasis and frustration.
- surface emotion: exclamation ""not-happy"" indicates dissatisfaction.
- emotional contrasts: the use of ""fucking"" to describe a car implies a strong negative emotion that's not typically expressed towards inanimate objects in non-sarcastic contexts.
- language style: utilization of internet slang such as ""#car #died"" shows a potentially casual or colloquial",1,1

### response: 

to identify sarcasm in text, there are several cues to look for:

**language style**: the language used is often informal and may contain exaggerated or ironic expressions. in this case, phrases like ""i like"" and ""they're miles and miles behind me"" are used to convey the opposite of what is believed, suggesting a sarcastic tone.

**special symbols**: the presence of symbols such as ""|"" in the original text was likely incorrect or",1,"### response:

the keywords are ""i like"", ""people thinks"", ""2 steps ahead"", ""miles and miles behind"", and ""#sarcasm"". special symbols in the text include '|#sarcasm'. the surface emotion expressed is laughter, indicated by 'ahahahaha'. since the text states one believes they are ahead, but the truth is they are behind, this indicates a discrepancy between what the speaker believes and the reality, which is often a common element in sarcasm",1,1

this text could potentially be confusing, as it may be interpreted as overly polite or obsequious, but it is context-dependent. for instance, the double question marks after the last sentence are typically informal and can be considered part of internet slang, potentially indicating jokingness or exaggeration, which might lead some to perceive it as a form of irony. off the bat, the syntax and structure don't typically scream sarcasm or exaggerated politeness, which are common cues when identifying sarcastic",1,0

to assign a label, we first examine the cues within the text:

- **emotional contrasts**: the text uses the phrase 'tis the season for tablets!', which humorously implies that the season itself is exciting for getting tablets. however, the sentiment later seems offbeat because it implies the excitement of giving or getting tablets to everyone is part of a contest, making the phrase a bit ironic and mocking.

- **keywords**: key words that might indicate sarcasm include 'excited",1,"### response: 

this text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm:

1. **keywords**: 'tis, entered, win, tablet gift pack (sounding less challenging than winning), and #tabletsforall contest (hypocritical tone).
2. **surface emotion**: despite the text suggesting excitement or desire (""entered the contest"", ""win a tablet gift pack""), the use of 'tis the season creates a more melancholic or mocked holiday sentiment.
3. **emotional words",1,"### response: 

cues:
- emotional words: ""entered"", ""win"", ""gift pack"" imply an optimistic or hopeful tone.
- emotional contrasts: the phrase ""entered the #tabletsforall contest"" suggests a positive and hopeful attitude towards a potentially exciting outcome.
- cultural background: uses hashtags commonly found on social media platforms, such as '#tabletsforall', suggesting a familiarity with modern communication and digital trends.

- context: user seems to be very happy about the cavs winning.

the text contains a strong and positive emotion towards the cavs winning, using exclamation points and capital letters. there's also an apparent use of irony considering the use of the hashtag ""#that'swhatimeanttosay"" which is usually used when one realizes they've said the opposite of what they intended. this combination of emotional contrasts and a cultural/special symbol often used in sarcastic contexts suggests that the intent might be sarcastic.

### explanation:

1. **surface emotion**: the words ""definitely not"" suggest a negative reaction to a potential proposition, but in the context of the sentence, this is underlined by sarcasm, not genuine negation.

the input text exhibits several cues that suggest sarcasm. the use of ""@"" might indicate a tone that is mocking or ironic, especially considering the cultural context associated with internet communications. the sentence is structured in a way that presents an argument against racism, yet the user specifies that racism is indeed a systemic issue in american institutions, which often implies a critical point or concern about the actual state of institutions in america. moreover, the phrase ""black/white binary construction"" might also be a",1,"### response: 

cues:
- rhetorical devices: as @deray is indirectly making a strong statement (""definitely not..."") that contrasts with the original statement (""racism is systematic and entrenched in every american institution..also in black/white binary construction""), this potentially implies sarcasm.

to classify sarcasm in the given text, let's analyze the cues step by step:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the text starts with a surprising and urgent tone (""someone tell me""), indicating a potentially ironic or sarcastic sentiment. the use of all caps and excessive punctuation points to heightened emotion.

2. **topic**: the topic is about seeking a ""fried chicken ornament,"" hinting at a playful and potentially absurd interest, which sometimes signals sarcasm.

3. **",1,"response: 
from the input text, cues can be extracted as follows:
- topic: mention of 'fried chicken ornament' and an urgency to find it, suggesting the context is related to home decor or christmas items.
- surface emotion: the use of 'tf' (and the pseudo-abbreviation, which is a form of internet slang), 'shit', and the figurative language construction ('this shit is necessary') convey a casual and somewhat mocking tone, despite the 'urgency'.

explanation:
1. punctuation: the exclamation points after ""necessary"" and the use of ""tf"" (a non-standard, slang abbreviation) indicate a tone that is intended to convey frustration or disbelief.

the input text contains certain cues that might indicate sarcasm. firstly, from the cultural background perspective, the phrase ""where my house is stunningly beautiful"" is used to later contrast the wish of owning an ""isle far away from here"" with the anonymity of only having ""some closed ppl who appreciate me as a human"". this contrast creates an unintended ironic meaning, suggesting that the speaker might not actually want to isolate themselves from everyone else in such a perfect but remote location.

regarding",1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. **surface emotion**: the speaker appears to express a desire for solitude and appreciation. this suggests a positive, almost romantic, feeling about being secluded with people who value them. however, the overall tone can also be perceived as slightly desperate, hinting at a more complex or ironic emotion.

2. **emotional contrasts**: the use of words like ""stunningly beautiful"" and ""appreciates me",1,1

### explanation:

- **context:** the context is the situation that is described or implied by the use of words and expressions. in this case, the context is about having three exams today.
- **topic:** the topic of the text is about exams, which is a common subject in an educational setting.
- **rhetorical devices:** the user employs rhetorical devices such as the use of excessive enthusiasm (""lets gooooo!"") and the inclusion of hashtags",1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm:

1. **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""lets gooooo!"" is an exaggerated expression of enthusiasm that doesn't quite match the actual situation being described. the use of elongated pronunciation with multiple ""o's"" is likely intended to emphasize a level of excitement or eagerness which actually serves as a contrast to the implication of the next part of the statement.

this sentence utilizes irony as a rhetorical device, specifically oxymoron (""little"" vs. ""attracts""), which could set the tone for sarcasm. the context implies the author may not actually mean that they are attracted to ""little things"" as one would typically think when saying something catches their interest. though the phrase ""that's"" is distracting in its grammatical inconsistency, the overall nuance and punctuation hint at a sentiment that is contradictory or opposing common expectations.

1. **emotional words**: the phrase ""his crime"" can be interpreted as sarcastic since it implies a humorous or exaggerated, albeit negative, appraisal.

2. **special symbols**: the hashtags ""#pantsdowntiggy"", ""#moot"", and ""#irony"" add a layer of irony. often, in online communication, hashtags are used to tag sentiments or situations in a way that indicates ironic tone.

3.",1,"### response: 

the input text uses hashtags as special symbols ('#pantsdowntiggy', '#moot', '#irony') and employs language style cues such as direct addressing in '@aftergrogblog'. additionally, it includes the use of rhetorical devices, specifically ironic statements suggesting that 'pixelation #moot or #irony', which imply that pixelation may not be a serious issue ('#moot') and that the situation is perhaps ironic.

the input text uses the rhetorical device of irony by suggesting a ""right thirst"" which is typically a humorous way to express being very thirsty. the surface emotion is likely humor or amusement rather than literal thirst. the language style is casual and could be seen as slightly exaggerated for effect, typical in social media posts. the emotional words include ""right thirst"" which implies excess or overindulgence. emotional contrasts are present, suggesting a state far beyond regular thirst.

the cues extracted from the input text are:
1. emotional contrasts: the repetition of ""coin !"" suggests an exaggerated enthusiasm or a parody of enthusiasm, which is often associated with sarcasm.

the cues extracted from the input text for sarcasm classification are:

- **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""that bump off the apron looked like it hurt"" followed by a direct question, ""was that padding u landed on,"" creates a rhetorical switch typical of sarcasm. the ""..."" at the end of the sentence also suggests an unfinished or unexpected sentiment, pointing to irony.

- **rhetorical devices:** the user, @joshuasinghaiw, mentions that 'the bump off the apron looked like it hurt,' suggesting an opposite reality of what happened. they then ask if it was padding that they landed on. this underscores a rhetorical device that uses the opposite of the expected truth to either emphasize an aspect of the reality or to elicit an emotional response.

the input text uses the hashtag '#sarcasm' explicitly, which is a keyword indicating possible sarcasm. the language style is informal and playful, using 'u' instead of 'you'. the rhetorical device 'padding u landed on' could be seen as a form of exaggeration for讽刺 effect. there is a cultural background of internet slang and use of social media handles.
