the speaker is expressing concern about the survival of a fetus outside the womb, even with mechanical assistance. the topic is medical ethics and the reality of fetal survival outside the womb. the sentence is not punctuated abnormally, and there are no keywords that immediately indicate sarcasm. no common knowledge is displayed that would suggest the speaker is joking.

the text uses a tone that is solemn and concerned about the implications of technology and survival, which could imply that the speaker believes in the importance of considering the consequences of using such technology. however, the content of the text discusses a grim reality in medicine about fetal lung maturity and the importance of considering the survival probability of a newborn, rather than the ethics or outcome of the procedure itself. therefore, the sarcasm detector could interpret this text by noting the absence of any humorous or ironic",1,1

2. **keywords:** the phrase ""put a bullet",1,"to provide a thorough response, let's analyze the input sentence step by step and classify it based on the instructions provided.

### step 1: language style
1. the sentence is written in formal/informal language but could be considered a mix with some elements of vulgar language (""bastards"").

### explanation:

1. **keywords**: ""really believe in god"" should carry little to no belief for someone so skeptical. it stands in contrast to the hypothesis that ""he has shown us no compelling evidence of his existance"". this strong expectation with the opposite provided hypothesis indicates irony.

### label: sarcastic

### cues:
- special symbols: n/a
- rhetorical devices: rhetorical question (""and i dont really believe in god because he has shown us no compelling evidence of his existance."")
- surface emotion: humor or irony (saying they don't believe in something but mocking the concept of ""compelling evidence"" as a form of proof)
- context: religious belief or faith
- topic: religion",1,"### response: 

the use of ""no compelling evidence"" in the context of discussing god's existence could be seen as a rhetorical device, potentially indicating sarcasm. the juxtaposition of the belief in god and the lack of evidence might suggest a mocking or ironic tone. although the statement itself could be serious, the unique phrasing might hint at its intended ironic meaning.

the input text makes use of a rhetorical device, specifically the appeal to absurdity (comparing a square circle to the existence of gods with specific properties). it also relies on common knowledge, as the audience is assumed to understand that a square circle cannot exist. the text displays a surface emotion of sarcasm and irony as it employs unexpected turns and logical absurdity to convey its point. the context is philosophical, dealing with the argument against the existence of gods. the cultural background is",1,"### response: 

to classify the input text, let's break it down and analyze the cues:

- **context:** the input is discussing arguments, ""against gods,"" dealing with incompatible traits, such as a square circle; this suggests a philosophical or religious context where debate is common, between opposing viewpoints (arguing for and against the existence of gods).

- **surface emotion:** the language is neutral, and there is no overt emotional expression. the speaker acknowledges simple negatives made by others and compares",1,1

the writer is using a formal and somewhat pedantic writing style, which includes an extensive and detailed explanation of their thoughts on the topic. they are also using a conscious effort to keep things short and sweet and avoid overwhelming the reader with information. emotional contrasts are evident in their use of sarcasm when they express that ""toe isn't all that random"", giving the impression that they are contradicting a popular belief in an ironic manner. the topic revolved around evolutionary theory and sexual selection",1,label: sarcastic,1,1

1. **emotional contrasts:** context in the text contains contrasting emotions/tones: observing that despite not needing to know motivation, intelligence tests still possess predictive power, which can be seen as a positive traits, but followed by the suggestion that intelligence tests are 'perhaps better predictors...' which can imply a subtle comparison with 'interviews, personality inventories, aptitude tests' suggesting, indirectly, that intelligence tests may possess an advantage.

2. **keywords:**",1,"### response: 

this passage seems to contain elements of persuasion and argumentation, which could be interpreted as sarcasm given the overall tone of condescension followed by a suggestion that intelligence tests are the best predictors for success. the speaker spends time discussing the potential value of motivations in predicting intelligence, only to undermine the importance of motivations by stating that intelligence tests are better predictors.

the text uses formal language and provides a detailed explanation without any obvious special symbols. the keywords ""not necessary"", ""accurate predictions"", ""extend predictive power"", and ""better predictors"" show that the text might be pretending to present a serious viewpoint while actually agreeing with a common misconception or overemphasizing the value of intelligence testing. the cultural background of discussing intelligence and its testing is common in academic and professional settings. the emotional contrasts are subtle, as the text appears to be",1,1

this statement uses a literal interpretation of the brady law in a context where one would expect a more severe and direct impact on criminal activity, particularly regarding firearms. the language style and tone are relatively neutral and straightforward, using a simple sentence structure without complex rhetorical devices. the topic deals with gun control, a subject that often sparks strong, emotionally charged discussions but would usually be presented with an opinion or stance, rather than being raised in a matter-of-fact, almost humorous tone. key",1,"### response: 

the use of the ""/sarcasm"" tag at the end of the sentence and the tone of the statement, which appears to be absurd given the well-known fact that the brady law (which requires universal background checks on gun buyers) does not have a significant deterrent effect on criminals, suggests a strong contrast between the stated sentiment and the typical expectation. additionally, the inclusion of this specific tag (""/sarcasm"") explicitly signals that the statement is intended as a humorous comment on",1,"### response:

this sentence uses formal language, sophisticated vocabulary (e.g., ""proof"", ""rmns"", ""development of hands and feet""), and includes an emotional contrast (""i don't expect""). however, considering the context, it's likely being sarcastic by expecting the recipient not to understand a given complex concept.

this text exhibits a subtle sarcasm in its style by presenting arguments in a seemingly logical and rational manner to highlight the irrationality and lack of evidence in religious faith. the language style includes the use of ironic contrasting statements and ambiguous symbols ('good science' vs 'that vast majority of religion'). the emotional contrast arises from presenting science, typically associated with rationality, as a contrasting value to faith, often perceived as irrational. the presence of 'this' to indicate sarcasm, though",1,"### response:

considerations for labeling:

1. **rhetorical devices:** the use of repetition (""i am not intitled to my opinions?""), a rhetorical question, to emphasize the disagreement.
2. **language style:** the mix of formal and informal language (""intitled"" included), followed by a humorous non sequitur (""because it seems that others also suffer from pot and kettleism"").
3. **cultural background:** an apparent understanding and usage of the proverb ""pot calling the kettle",1,"to classify whether the input text is sarcastic or not, i will examine the cues provided:

1. **language style**: the phrasing ""so i am not intitled to my opinions?"" uses a formal sentence format, but it includes a common grammatical error (""intitled"" instead of ""entitled"") which might be a deliberate literary device.

2. **emotional words**: the words ""ironic,"" ""suffer,"" and ""don't realize"" are used. ""ironic",1,"### response: 

given the use of words like ""ironic"", ""pot and kettleism"", the sentence structure with contrasts (""so i am not intitled to my opinions?"" vs ""your statement is so ironic""), and the presence of punctuation to enhance the tone (especially the repetition of ""so""), the text likely uses sarcasm to make a point.

emotional contrasts: the text has a sarcastic undertone, clearly mocking the implied answer from the recipient.

in this text, the cues for sarcasm classification include the context and structure of the sentence rather than explicit cues like emoticons or clear emotional word usage. the sentence uses a rhetorical question structure to imply a rather insulting connotation (""you have no understanding""), suggesting a tone opposite to what the words literally convey. this context and structure are typical of sarcastic communication.

**language style**: the language style used in this sentence could be seen as condescending or mocking. it accommodates a logical, direct tone combined with a somewhat ironic sensibility, where the speaker is discussing the logical flaws in certain views being presented.

**emotional words**: the phrase ""poor wording"" implies criticism, and ""try to lead one to some conclusion about"" could be read as sarcastically implying that the other views are improperly guiding",1,1

the input text contains several cues that might suggest sarcasm or not. generally, sarcasm involves using words with meanings opposite to their literal definitions with the intent of conveying mockery, irony, or disdain.

1. **context:** there seems to be no direct context provided that might strongly suggest a specific tone for this passage, which could either be factual or light-hearted.

2. **keywords:** words like ""sorry"" and ""you can send it to me, pm, or email",1,"### response: 

this text doesn't lean heavily into sarcasm or irony. the writer is sincerely apologizing for being unable to locate information and offers to make amends.

### label: not sarcastic",0,"### response: 

this request seems a bit odd, considering the user should just post the link themselves if they have access. also, the excessive use of abbreviations (""b"", ""pm"") might suggest a casual tone familiar among friends or acquaintances, but without emotional contrasts or especial symbols, it's hard to nail it down as sarcasm.

**surface emotion:** neutral

**emotional words:** there are no overtly emotional words in this sentence.

**emotional contrasts:** the contrast lies in the discrepancy between agreeing to a statement and the acknowledgment of there being more to it. the sarcasm is subtle, as the agreement is followed by hinting that it might not be a truly full agreement",1,"### response:

the input text has a formal tone, with direct agreement that makes it seem sincere. it lacks parentheses, emojis, or other common punctuation marks used in a sarcastic tone. the context and topic are neutral with no signs of irony or exaggerated commentary, and it deals with a straightforward statement. given that there is no indication of cultural background that would hint at sarcasm and no reference to common knowledge that would require a sarcastic approach, the text does not exhibit cues of sarcasm.",1,"### response:

this input text contains multiple cues that suggest the presence of sarcasm. firstly, there is an emotional contrast, where the speaker starts by referring to ""equal protection"" and how it ""says"" something must be done, implying a rather objective view. however, the same ""real point"" they mention subsequently mocks and derides this very notion by exaggerating the consequences - like ""ruining marriage in this country"", ""making this country more secular"", etc. - a stark contrast",1,"label: sarcastic

cues:
- rhetorical devices: the use of ""and we have to stop that"" at the end, highlighting the intensity and absurdity of the preceding argument.
- context: the argument's perplexing stance on gay marriage, suggesting multiple perspectives within the text that contradict each other.
- cultural background: the reference to maintaining traditional values and the potential impact on the country's secular nature may reflect a cultural concern about the roles of marriage and sexuality.
- emotional",1,"### response:

as an ai, i analyze the input text for cues indicative of sarcasm, and in this case:

- **punctuation** is utilized extensively to convey emotion, particularly at the end of sentences, suggesting exaggerated emotions that might not align with typical expressions of passion in non-sarcastic contexts.
- **cultural background** might refer to a specific viewpoint on gay marriage, which is often a politicized issue, however, sarcasm in this context is not directly tied to this",1,1

to analyze the input text, we will identify the cues such as topic, rhetorical devices, emotional words, special symbols, and common knowledge:

- **topic**: the text is about the environmental concern regarding the consumption and production of paper, specifically discussing the risk to world forests and the increasing use of recycled paper.
  
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""not really"" at the beginning could be used to assert a contrary expectation or to introduce a fictional scenario, hinting",1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues that indicate a non-sarcastic tone. 

- **surface emotion:** there is no overtly emotional language; the tone is matter-of-fact.
- **emotional contrasts:** the text contrasts the general perception that forests are being threatened for paper production, with the reality that the paper industry is increasingly using recycled paper. this contrasting information sets up expectations for what the text will present, which aligns with the non-sarcast",1,1

this question, while seemingly straightforward in its wording, is posed in a manner that suggests a playful inversion or exaggeration typical in sarcastic questions. anyone familiar with biological concepts or scientific discussions of genetics would understand that cells are indeed controlled by their genes. but by asking a question that assumes the removal of genes, when this biological fact is actually grounded in reality, the intent is likely to slightly absurd or humorous, pointing out the formality and literalness of scientific language.

### c",1,"### response: 

keywords: ""controlled by their genes"", ""environment"", ""cell"", ""genes were removed""

common knowledge: cells are indeed controlled by their genes and the environmental factors.

context: the text tries to predict a consequence or outcome in a scientific context by discussing the relationship between cells, their genes, and the environment.

emotional contrasts: absence of an emotional tone, rather a tone of scientific inquiry.

surface emotion: inquiry or curiosity

to classify the input text, we can analyze several cues as follows:

1. **cultural background**: the text doesn't directly reference any specific cultural reference or context that is commonly associated with sarcasm. sarcasm often relies on culturally specific catchphrases, idioms, or nuances, which might not be present here.

2. **rhetorical devices**: the sentence ""the pot should not have rights"" is a straightforward statement that carries a social political undertone.",1,"### response:

**cues:**

1. **language style:** the text uses a somewhat formal tone while still managing to be sarcastic with the inclusion of emoticons :). using terms like ""pot"" and ""acid"" in a casual context is also key.

the input text contains several cues that may lead to the classification of it as sarcastic:

1. **emotional words**: ""most"" and ""just poor logic"" are used in an accusatory manner, suggesting a negative emotional tone that is often employed in sarcastic statements.

3. **keywords**: the key phrases here are ""i.e. misrepresentation, strawman arguments, flat out lies,",1,"### response: 

the comment is likely attempting to criticize someone for using dishonest tactics or faulty logic in their arguments. the specificity provided (""misrepresentation,"" ""strawman arguments,"" ""flat out lies,"" etc.) gives a detailed tone of disapproval. punctuation might include exclamation marks or emphasis on certain words through italics or bold if delivered digitally, but it's not provided in the text.

1. **rhetorical devices**: the text includes direct criticism (""most of your comments follow some form of dishonesty"") and judgmental language (""plain lies""). the implied comparison to ""strawman arguments,"" ""pretending not to understand,"" and ""poor logic"" suggests a comparative argumentative strategy, which can indicate sarcasm - as these terms are usually used to critique a faulty form of argumentation rather than to describe oneself.

in this text, the writer uses dry, informative language which can minimize the emotional impact of such a tragic subject matter. the use of 'most likely' and 'last i looked' succinctly suggests a level of ambiguity, inherently inviting a level of uncertainty or potential inability to find a conclusive answer - a trait often found in sarcastic discourse.

1. **rhetorical devices:** the text employs several rhetorical devices, chief among them is the use of ironic contrasting expressions (""i believe this is wrong"" versus ""that's fine"" in relation to discrimination), which indicate sarcasm. the use of rhetorical questions (""do i agree with it? no. but does it have to do with our debate? no."") adds more layers to the sarcastic intent.

1. **emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""just as a church may outlaw"" allows to compare two opposing entities (private company and church) to express a point of critique from the opposite perspective, maintaining irony.

### explanation:

1. **topic**: the discussion revolves around a sensitive social issue - gay rights and gay marriage. deliberately addressing a controversial and emotive topic sets an emotional base for possible sarcasm.

2. **emotional contrasts**: the text portrays similar sentiments towards a topic in contrasting tones without empathizing with the viewpoint being critiqued. for example, the text states ""of course everyone has some basis for their views. not even denying that",1,"### label: sarcastic

the text appears to be using sarcasm. it is formed by the use of rhetorical questions and possibly irony. the text mentions the ""toe"" being defined as changes in alleles, suggesting it may be referring to ""theory of everything"" in a humorous way. the text seemingly exaggerates the confusion and misuse of terminology around biology and science, which could imply mockery.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm. firstly, the special symbols and punctuation use appears deliberate and exaggerated, such as the repetition of ""why do we invoke darwin?"" which creates an ironic tone. 

secondly, there are emotional contrasts and irony present. the author sarcastically questions whether the discovery of clindamycin would have been possible without evolution, a topic that is unrelated to the existence of the term 'toe'. this shows an overt disagreement with the",1,"### label: sarcastic

the cues extracted from the input text for sarcasm classification are:

this text presents a style that is overly formal and polite, similar to that of bureaucracy or a paid advertisement. this might suggest irony or sarcasm, as it is making a request for something that is very unlikely to be provided, given that the statement ""this is evidence of creation"" is quite broad and seemingly without context where one would typically not require evidence for creation. sarcasm is a common way to express disapproval or ridicule through overly formal and polite language.

based on the cues extracted from the input text, the topic appears to be discussing evidence related to the concept of creation. the context seems to be engaging the reader, expecting an explanation and a reference. the language style is formal and polite, using a question mark and a colon-separated exclamation mark to express curiosity and encourage engagement. keywords include ""evidence,"" ""creation,"" ""explanation,"" and ""reference."" the emotional words used here are primarily functional, with ""please""",1,"### response: 

this sentence uses sarcastic tone by presenting a direct question in an incredulous way (""how?""), requesting evidence, and thanking the responder, followed by an overuse of punctuation which are often used in sarcastic expressions. this, plus the juxtaposition of the word ""creation"" in a seemingly serious context, combined with the overall disbelief and mocking tone, suggests the speaker is not actually asking for a logical explanation but rather making a sarcastic comment.

the input text makes a claim about the pronunciation of a name, suggesting ""yeshua"" as the accurate one and then contrasts this with the lack of acceptance among scholars. it uses a factual statement followed by an ironic twist (the lack of acceptance). the text does not utilize cultural background, common knowledge beyond the basic fact about the name, or explicit rhetorical devices.

to classify the given text, let's extract the cues:

1. **common knowledge:** the text openly compares two scenarios (staying safe vs risking life) with potential outcomes and personal preferences. this isn't an ordinary comparison; it involves ethical and practical decision-making, expected to elicit consideration from a reasonable adult audience.
2. **surface emotion:** the text employs sarcasm to express feeling better about losing the laptop than risking one’s life. this is masked by the",1,"### response: 

the input text employs a style that contrasts with the common expectations of the topic, using a logical and delicate phrasing to express a serious concern about personal safety. the emotional contrast is evident in the choice between risking one's life for possessions and valuing safety more. keywords like ""better to lose my laptop than my life"" indicate the relative importance the speaker places on safety. therefore, the label assigned should be:

this statement appears to present a logical argument for a moral and legal principle, questioning the allowance to withhold sustenance from a negligibly dependent individual based on the caregiver's rights.

- emotional words: none explicitly stated, but the tone might be somewhat interrogative or inquire about the morality, suggesting a subtle sense of doubt or puzzlement.

- surface emotion: reflective, questioning, or perhaps a bit empathetic.

- topic: post-birth sustenance",1,"### response:

the input text is using rhetorical questions and comparing the fetus to a newborn child to emphasize the argument about rights. the language style is formal with a hint of persuasion. the surface emotion seems to be serious and argumentative, advocating for the protection of the fetus's rights. there are no special symbols, but the context revolves around a legal and moral debate on rights.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### response: 

the input text uses a rhetorical question and makes a comparison to mother's milk, indicating a contrast in the treatment of a fetus and a newborn. there is also a sense of strong disapproval and argumentative language, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. punctuation, such as the series of periods before the rhetorical question, emphasizes this tone. the language style is more formal and infused with legal terminology, adding to the sarcastic undertone.

the provided text contains several cues that could indicate sarcasm:

1. **common knowledge**: the text seems to be referring to a fact that might be well-known or typical, such as planned parenthood (pp) providing more abortion and emergency contraception services than other services. this kind of statement could potentially be sarcastic if the intent is to criticize or mock the predominance of those services.

1. **surface emotion:** the presence of three 'p' symbols (ppp) at the end of the sentence creates a sarcastic tone, implying a mocking or ironic intent.

based on the cues provided:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the text presents a sarcastic tone when discussing beliefs about dinosaurs and man living at the same time, contrasting with the seemingly supportive, naive tone for the possibility of a future road trip.

2. **punctuation**: excessive comma usage (two commas) following the question about shared information might indicate a joking or sarcastic tone, as it complicates the sentence structure to create a clunky, exaggerated effect.

1. **common knowledge:** the principle of biogenesis is a fact from biology which asserts that all living things are produced from other living things, i.e., life can only originate from life. it's a concept used to argue against the idea that a fetus is not a child since it's produced by a human (which is a living entity).

to determine the label for this input text, let's analyze the cues:

1. **common knowledge**: the text discusses a moral argument regarding abortion in a manner that aligns with general knowledge on the topic, using logic and principles related to the development of a fetus.

the emotional contrast is between the pro-life stance and the hypocrisy of labeling it as such, especially in the context of rape. emotional words include ""hipocritical"" and ""must survive"". the topic is abortion and its moral implications, specifically the conditions under which it may be justified. the surface emotion is one of frustration or strong disapproval. there's a clear cultural background involved, especially in the arguments made based on biology and moral principles such as the principle of biogenesis.",1,1

1. **emotional contrasts**: the contrast in emotions can be considered through the intensity of the language used. in this case, the text might sarcastically imply that the format of the discussion is preferable to the actual discussion that is happening by mentioning a ""formal type debate judged by a third party,"" which implies a more rigorous process might be better received.

2. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion might be viewed as slightly more",1,"to assign an appropriate label to this text using the provided cues, let's dissect it:

1. **language style**: there is a subtle contrast between ""yes but"" and the following text, which indicates that the speaker is acknowledging an opposing view but introducing an additional point. this contrast suggests an ironic or sarcastic tone. however, the use of ""welcome to the forum."" is a neutral ledgifting line often used at forums or discussion platforms that aims to sustain an amicable atmosphere.

this text contains an emotional contrast between the formal proposal and the current informal discussion, which might be perceived as ironic or sarcastic. the context suggests that the speaker might be disappointed or annoyed that the debate has not progressed to a more structured format, as initially proposed. therefore, there are elements suggestive of sarcasm.

the input text ""just to point out, the class that id is being taught in is a comparative religion class."" could potentially be categorized as ""sarcastic"". here's the breakdown of the cues:

- **language style:** the language style could imply sarcasm due to the ""just to point out"" phrase which often precedes an obvious or expected point, and which can be used sarcastically to highlight the insidiousness of the preceding statement.

- **emotional",1,"### response: 

the speaker's use of a straightforward, factual tone in mentioning that the class is about comparative religion suggests a lack of irony or concealed mockery. this type of statement might be expected in an objective, informative context. 

### cues:
- cultural background: the comment is made in an academic context, which typically would not involve sarcasm unless clear indicators are present.
- surface emotion: the sentence is neutral with a straightforward informational delivery.
- common knowledge: the subject is comparative",1,"### response: 

this statement seems to be straightforward and devoid of any exaggerated expression, hyperbole, or irony that is typical in sarcasm. it directly provides information about the class nature without any indication of mockery or unintended humor. therefore, the rhetorical devices mentioned (common in sarcasm detection) are not evident.

### cues extracted:

- **common knowledge:** the reference to the class being a comparative religion class is grounded in facts that most people would know or understand.

the presence of sarcasm is largely conveyed through the use of exclamation points and elongated words like ""almost,"" ""every,"" and ""your."" arguments that are exaggerated (the idea of ignoring discussions of family while asserting society's foundation relies on families) serve as further indicators of sarcasm. the language style is confrontational and mocking in tone, especially when addressing ""jyoshu"" by speaking in a manner of disbelief and ridicule.

### cues:
- **punctuation**: excessive use of punctuation, especially question marks (""""), creates a sarcastic tone and emphasizes the absurdity of the argument.

the input text contains a conversation between two individuals discussing the topic of abortion. the context implies a discussion around the complexity and personal circumstances behind such decisions.

*punctuation*: several punctuation cues help structure the text:
            - commas separate items in a list: ""each woman who has an abortion""; also, carry pause before the phrase ""could",1,"### response: 

the input text uses rhetorical questions (""you didn't have my experiences"") and emphasizes the uncertainty around every woman's circumstances (""coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences"") to create an emotional contrast. the language style is rhetorical and accusatory, adding sarcasm. the punctuation, particularly the sarcasm-raisng question marks, also points to sarcasm. however, the surface emotion seems to be concern or empathy which is typically associated with non-sarcastic text.

the input text contains multiple cues:

1. **emotional words**: the words ""yes"" and ""but"" can be considered emotional in this context, as they subtly convey a sense of sarcasm. the juxtaposition of ""yes"" followed by ""but"" establishes a contrast that highlights the opposition to closing the borders, building tension and implying a sarcastic tone.

2. **rhetorical devices**: there is disagreement or opposition within the text (""yes",1,"### response:

cues:
- **context**: the context involves discussions about government actions (batfe, presumably referring to the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives in the us) and immigration policies, suggesting a political or social topic.
- **emotional contrasts**: the second statement, ""yes but some people don't want to close the borders. they prefer no border controls."", contrasts with a potential expectation for agreement or direct discourse on the matter by instead introducing a counterpoint view",1,### label: not sarcastic,0,1

### explanation of cues:

1. **special symbols**: the presence of emoticons (in this case, ""x cry"") is a strong hint of sarcasm. emoticons are often used to convey sarcasm or to playfully mock the subject being discussed.

to determine whether the text is sarcastic or not, let's analyze the cues:

1. **emotional contrasts:** the text starts by addressing hypothetical ""you people"" who presumably annoy the speaker with personal insults, creating a contrast between the open discourse and the targeted subject's reaction.

2. **surface emotion:** the speaker appears to express surprise or incredulity, as suggested by the emoticonxcry, while simultaneously arguing that abortion at eight months is equivalent to killing a viable",1,"### label: sarcastic

- **context**: the text presents a dialogue-like narrative, with the speaker specifying to 'you people' about applying a personal insult, suggesting a confrontational tone. however, this is counterbalanced by the speaker's self-disclosure about being born prematurely, which generally ups the emotional intensity of the opposing stance.

- **keywords**: the keywords in this text are ""whine"", ""personal insults"", ""i believe"", ""fully developed"", """,1,1

the surface emotion in the input text is surprise or confusion, as the speaker seems genuinely puzzled by the question about the negative impact on the inquirer. the topic is personal relationships and commitment. the context is a conversation where the speaker emphasizes their long-term exclusive relationship, likely trying to reason that this indicates stability and potential morality in relationships. the common knowledge includes understanding societal expectations and norms around long-term commitment in relationships. the rhetorical devices used are highlighting their personal experience (rhetorical",1,"### response: 

given the context of the question, the speaker is making a statement that initially appears to be in support of long-term monogamous relationships. the use of a question mark and the context of the discussion (assuming it's in response to possibly a negative reaction to such relationships) create a subtle contrast that might be interpreted as sarcasm. however, without additional context, it's challenging to confidently identify sarcasm. the statement itself doesn't contain overt sarcasm cues such as exaggerated expressions",1,"### response:

### cues:

- **punctuation:** the text uses punctuation to convey frustration and sarcasm, such as forceful sentences ending with ""!"" which could be sarcastically addressing someone or something with assertion and conviction; and ""that child does not have a choice"" uses a rhetorical question to make a point.
- **common knowledge:** this relates to societal views on issues like pregnancy, choice, and respect for human life, which are commonly debated. the use of",1,"### response: 

### label: sarcastic",1,"### response:

this text uses rhetoric likely intended to provoke emotional reactions, such as mentioning a pregnant woman and then using the term ""murder."" it contrasts its perspective with the phrase ""your view of choice is your belief,"" which indicates a stance on personal beliefs versus imposed views. therefore, it likely employs sarcasm.

to classify this text as either sarcastic or not sarcastic, let's break down the cues based on the provided instruction:

1. **language style:** the language used is formal and legalistic, with the phrase ""you do have rights"" being part of a potential legislative statement (or a discussion about symbolism existing in a legal, political context). the delivery is largely neutral, which might suggest the speaker is holding back criticism.

2. **special symbols:** there are no unusual",0,"certainly, to complete your request, we need to analyze the input text to classify whether it carries a sarcastic tone or not. here's how the cues you specified can help us:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the language here appears to switch between a direct informative tone (""remember: you do have rights"") and a somewhat rhetorical tone regarding the country's founding beliefs. this contrast might indicate sarcasm, as the author may be suggesting that, despite the obvious connection between the country's founding",1,1

the statement seems to present statistical data in a matter-of-fact tone, which could sometimes imply sarcasm, given the stark contrast between the high number of denials and the claimed decrease in violent crime and murder rate. the absence of emotive language in the text is also notable in both versions (not sarcastic vs sarcastic).

### explanation:
1. **emotional contrasts**: the text juxtaposes positive descriptions (""unusual and distressing"") and a serious health issue (""disability"") with a humorous observation about aqueous abortions (""probably why saline abortions are no longer used"").

2. **topic**: the topic is centered around aqueous abortions (a form of abortion involving the use of fluids) and their alleged cessation due to a speculated correlation with a disability.

3. **punctuation**: the use",1,"### response: 

the input text uses irony and emotional contrasts as rhetorical devices. the cultural background doesn't seem to influence the language used, but the topic is about medical procedures, which might require consideration of societal views on abortion. the language about ""distressing story"" and ""unfortunate"" seemingly emphasizes sympathy, which in this context seems to be a critique or disbelief rather than genuine feeling. considering these cues, the sentence is sarcastic in its approach.

### explanation:

in this input text, the sarcastic nature is primarily conveyed through the use of rhetorical devices and emotional contrasts. the speaker uses the bible to discuss seemingly empathetic points, while implying a counterintuitive perspective on how it was used in history. the text highlights how religious texts could be used to justify ""the enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks"" and ""treating blacks as mere property.""

common knowledge suggests this was often the case with",1,"### response: 

the input text employs heavy emotional language, such as ""justifying enslavement,"" ""mere property,"" and ""lynching,"" which are loaded with strong condemnation and indicate a critical tone. special symbols like slash (/) are used for a more deliberate emphasis on the contradiction or the intricacies of justifications. keywords like ""religious folk,"" ""justifying,"" ""slavery,"" and ""lynching"" are historically charged terms that suggest a discourse on controversial historical events with moral objections",1,"### response: 

the input text discusses historical misuse of the bible to justify cruel actions against a marginalized group. it specifically mentions enslavement, treating individuals as property, and lynchings. the text's presentation is straightforward and fact-based, despite its serious and tragic subject matter, which typically lacks explicit humorous emphasis which is a key element in sarcasm. the sentence structure and language used are appropriate for conveying detailed information and opinion rather than to add humor or irony.

### explanation:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the text starts with the phrase ""well for what it's worth,"" which is a commonly used expression to suggest that what follows might not be particularly valuable or useful. by contradicting it with the hypothetical situation of police departments using various firearms for serving warrants, the author creates a juxtaposition between what could be dangerous or risky (for individuals being served warrants and their neighbors) and what is considered the opposite, possibly",1,"### label: sarcastic

### cues:
- cultural background: mention of using military-grade weapons for self-defense in a domestic context could be seen as outside the norm and potentially used for sarcasm in certain situations.
- emotional words: ""hope that helped"" can be seen as a sarcastic comment because it implies the writer has no genuine hope that their advice would be helpful in any practical sense.
- keywords: ""ar-15 carbines,"" ""mp-5 9m",1,"### label: sarcastic

### explanation:

1. **common knowledge**: the statement includes factual information about police preferences for certain firearms, which is common knowledge for context.

2. **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions (""and the ak may be a bit much..."") is employed to assert that the ak would be a ridiculous choice for home use.

### explanation:

emotional words: no explicit emotion words jump out at the outset but, given the sarcastic nature of the answer and the rhetorical device used, emotions are implied.

language style:  the language style employs a logical argumentative approach which might indicate a sarcastic twist in the answer, bringing out the irony or the raymond carver effect.

context:  the setup for sarcasm is created by contrasting an apparent right for the woman to have an abortion due to",1,"in order to determine the label, let's analyze the provided text according to the given criteria: emotional contrasts, topic, common knowledge, rhetorical devices, and language style.

1. **emotional contrasts**: the tone is neutral, logical, and argumentative throughout the text.

### cues:
1. **surface emotion:** the question marks and the sarcasm-tinged tone created by the final sentence (""you have merely made a statement unsupported by any reasons."") suggest a mocking or ironic, rather than serious, attitude.

to determine the label for this input text, let's analyze the cues provided:

1. **cultural background:** the text is discussing religious texts, specifically the bible, which suggests a cultural background involving religious beliefs or knowledge about the bible and other fantastical or religious texts.

2. **emotional contrasts:** the tone of the question seems pointed and perhaps questioning, seeking more information, and expressing doubt about the reliability of holding the bible as ""definitely, without fail, the word",1,"to determine whether the input text is sarcastic or not, let's analyze the cues mentioned:

1. **punctuation**: the question appears to be a direct query, where the final punctuation is a period, which might be unusual in a sarcastic statement where one might expect an exclamation point or a question mark.
2. **rhetorical devices**: the text contains a rhetorical question (""what standards of proof do you hold the bible to?""), which is often used to express disapproval or",1,"### response:

cues found in the input text:

### explanation:
- **surface emotion**: the passage doesn't specifically express an overt emotion. however, sarcasm often doesn't rely on emotive language. it seems the high-level tone could be seen as skeptical or annoyed at the absurd claim that intelligence can be attributed to bacteria, corn plants, trees, jellyfish, and single-celled organisms.
- **topic**: the topic revolves around the discussion of intelligence, particularly whether it necessarily applies to all living organisms",1,"### response:

### cues:
- **punctuation**: the text uses deliberately elongated words (""eam""), creating a sarcastic tone, and ends with a colon for a list.

the input text uses questions and repetition (""no."") as rhetorical devices, and there is a sarcastic undertone in questioning the necessity of marriage for actions that are not typically associated with the need for marriage, like giving birth. the emotion could be perceived as somewhat mocking or ironic. however, there are no overtly specific punctuation cues or special symbols that typically mark sarcasm.

the input text makes use of common knowledge, such as the absence of laws stating one must be married before giving birth, to convey a serious question. however, the context and tone of the question, especially the use of 'but' after an apparently provocative statement, suggest a conversational tone that might be unexpected if the speaker truly believed the preceding statement was true. this could indicate sarcasm.

this text is informal and uses back-to-back negative responses (""no."") which is a common indicator of sarcasm. the context suggests a lack of sincerity or seriousness about the question being asked. additionally, question marks and uppercase letters might suggest a dramatic tone or possibly genuine astonishment. however, the sarcastic tone is strengthened by the repetition of ""no"" - a device often used for emphasis in humorous commentary.

to assign a correct label, first, let's extract the required cues:

1. **special symbols:** there are no special symbols like `@`, `$`, `%`, etc., in the sentence.

the cues extracted from the input text to classify whether it is sarcastic or not include:

1. **rhetorical devices**: the use of an apparent request (""you make it seem..."") in a context that implies the opposite. the speaker seems to imply that the act of reading their posts is not a favor at all.

2. **punctuation**: the inclusion of commas is somewhat unusual in this sentence. normally, commas are used to separate clauses in a sentence. here",1,"### response: 

the cues extracted from the input text include:

1. **language style**: the input text uses an ironic tone, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the word ""favors"" is used in a slightly mocking sense.

to classify the given input text as 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic', let's break down the text and identify the various cues:

the input text exhibits several cues typically associated with sarcasm:

1. **rhetorical devices**: the text employs the rhetorical question, ""hmmm, a mere human-mother cannot make decisions concerning her own body,"" which draws attention to the absurdity of the situation that will later be addressed through sarcasm. the sarcastic implication here is that humans, especially mothers, understand their own bodies better than anyone else.

the input text exhibits several cues that indicate sarcasm. key aspects include:

- **rhetorical devices:**
  - **implication of contradictions:** the speaker contradicts themselves in various ways, like starting by labeling all knowledge as ignorance and then questioning their initial statement.

the cues extracted from the input text are: surface emotion - confusion and sarcasm; context - philosophical debate; cultural background - not applicable since the text does not explicitly refer to any specific cultural context; rhetorical devices - rhetorical question, repetition (""ignorance"") and ironic claim (""calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate""); emotional contrasts - the speaker appears to actually be surprised by the non-simplified answer, but sarcastically implies that simplifying everything may be the",1,1

### cues:

1. **punctuation**: the use of multiple exclamation marks and periods in ""well, if history were binding"" and ""i don't know which part of the constitution has a ""preserve history"" clause"" conveys a tone that's satirical or overly emphatic, suggesting sarcasm.

2. **common knowledge**: the mention of ""slavery"" and ""abortion being illegal"" as historical facts creates a basis for the sarcastic comparison",1,"### response: 
in this text, the use of ellipsis and the sarcastic question ""i don't know which part of the constitution has a 'preserve history' clause"" suggest irony. the speaker is likely aware that the u.s. constitution doesn't contain a ""preserve history"" clause, despite falsely stating otherwise to make a point.

such statement seems to be addressing the audience with an implied contrast between the vulgar understanding and the possibly more refined opinion the speaker holds. the phrase 'pretty obvious' is used in a way that implies that the thing in question should indeed be obvious, possibly in a way that some are failing to recognize, retrospect, or even ignore. the 'hope' implicit in the phrase 'up to you' serves to indicate a certain passivity or neutrality from the speaker regarding the possibility of the",1,0

the input text contains certain cues that might indicate sarcasm. ""potential spouse"" could imply a humorous or ironic tone, suggesting that the proposition might not be taken literally. ""after you meet the prerequisite of being the proper gender for them"" adds to the sarcastic or mocking undertone.

### cues:
- **emotional words:** prerequisite, proper gender (sarcasm can involve playfully negative or exaggerated emotions).
- **context:** the text suggests a relationship scenario",1,"based on the input text, we can analyze the cues as follows:

**surface emotion:** the text itself does not express any overt emotion. however, its logical flow and usage of contrasting words (""your potential spouse...after you meet the prerequisite of being the proper gender for them"") suggest a deviation from a straightforward statement, which often indicates sarcasm.

**context:** the context involves a discussion about a person's characteristics that might attract a potential spouse. the dialogue touches on gender and expectations in relationships",1,"### response: 

the cues extracted from the input text are as follows:
- emotional words: none explicitly mentioned in this sentence.

### explanation:

1. **common knowledge**: the phrase ""you are into pommy bashing now?"" brings to mind the topic of british stereotyping, often involving negative biases. although the term ""pommy"" is a common term in the uk to refer to brits, using this term often invokes a contrast where some people might associate it with negative connotations or simplify the identity of individuals in the uk.

2. **keywords**: the words ""skeptic",1,"surface emotion: the text seems to express surprise or shock (""into pommy bashing now?""), and possibly a bit of irritation or frustration.

special symbols: the text contains emoticon 'emoticon' and rolled eyes 'xrolleyes' which are often used to convey sarcasm or negativity in written communications.

emotional contrasts: there is a contrast between the seemingly polite question ""anybody you don't like?"" and the implied annoyance or mockery in the response, indicated by the emoticon",1,1

this sentence appears to highlight the potential subjectivity and biased nature of interpreting evidence in the context of creationism, addressing the possible manipulation of facts or data. the use of the phrase ""bias determines"" implies that the proponents of a particular viewpoint (in this case, creationism) might not assess or prioritize evidence in a neutral manner, which could be seen as a satirical remark for those who find such blindness or dishonesty humorous.

the context here suggests a conversation or interaction between people that implies one person is making a slip of the tongue that reveals their thoughts.

the topic seems to be related to human behavioral or psychological aspects when the statement is made in the context of a freudian slip, which refers to the unconscious expression of an unconscious thought.

keywords that are noticeable are 'freudian slip', which indicates a subconscious slip in speech or writing, and 'smoking', which is an informal way of saying",1,"### response: 

the input text uses a rhetorical device (irony) to imply that the speaker is aware of the person's incorrect choice of words, which could be interpreted as a slip-up or error, suggesting that the person might be under the influence of something (having smoked something). this is a common cultural reference that might be understood in the context of smoking herbs or using language to provide another meaning to a statement. the style of the text seems casual and abrupt with a hint of humor.",1,1

### explanation:
1. **emotional words:** the text is filled with laughing and exaggerated ""ha"" repetitions, suggesting an attempt at humor or exaggeration, which are common signs of sarcasm.

2. **context:** the speaker seems to be mocking themselves, indicating they would usually be ""getting the jokes"" but in this instance, they're not. this context can be associated with the common feeling of telling a joke that falls flat, often used in sarcast",1,"### response:

the input text is characterized by a high frequency of capital letters and excessive use of ""hahaha"" which indicates strong emotional expression or emphasis. the context suggests a conversation about telling a joke, and there is irony in suggesting ""i should keep my jokes to myself,"" overlooking the fact that the person is still laughing and has shared the joke with their sister. therefore, i classify this text as **sarcastic**.

the text employs a rhetorical question, positing an interesting angle to provoke thought on the historical context provided. however, the intended irony lies submerged beneath the literal suggestion, carrying an unintended tone of dissatisfaction or disappointment with the stark difference in timeline between the sumerians and the hebrews that is being pointed out. the keywords submerged in potential sarcasm include ""interesting"" which might be used ironically despite its literal meaning. the labeling of keywords as emotional may seem off, as the primary",1,"### response: 

this statement uses the historical context of the sumerians as a backdrop to implicitly suggest a deeper, possibly ironic, meaning. it implies that if the sumerians and their culture were somehow relevant to a hebrew historical context - which was known to be far later - it would be fascinating, hinting at a hidden or unexpected connection that is not present.

### cues:
- **keywords:** ""considering"", ""sumerians"", ""long before"", ""hebrew historical record",1,"### response: 

the input text contains a contrast in terms of timing (""long before"") which might indicate sarcasm. additionally, there is an implicit expectation for a positive statement, which is negated with the phrase ""that would be interesting"". this contrast can often be a cue for sarcasm. the use of a comma for a list (sumerians existed) and seemingly normal phrasing also contribute to the impression that the statement is perhaps intended to be humorous.

the input text contains a few cues that lean towards sarcasm classification:

1. **punctuation**: the statement is punctuated normally, with periods ending each phrase. there's no punctuation that stands out as an indication of sarcasm on its own, but in context, the juxtaposition of tone against what appears to be a factual statement can suggest sarcasm.

### response: 

this text contains a number of cues that indicate sarcasm. first, the keyword ""love,"" which usually signifies a positive emotion, is employed sarcastically to convey a negative sentiment. the phrase ""ignorance lends itself to incredible mistakes,"" refers to the speaker's own behavior, but the way the phrase is executed hints that the speaker is actually calling out the listener's mistakes, sarcastically implying that they knowingly ignore facts.

""excepting""",1,"### context:
the context is a conversation or post where an individual is critiquing another's misunderstanding, particularly in regards to atheism and science. there's a playful attitude in addressing the 'magic sky man' trope often attributed to atheists.

### rhetorical devices:
- ** irony:** the statement suggests love towards ignorance, which is sarcastic.
- ** hyperbole:** ""you've been nothing but wrong"" exaggerates the perceived systematic failure of the responder.

### explanation:

1. **emotional words**: ""terminal disease"", ""die"", ""slowly"", ""make me go through that"", ""not a soul mate"", ""<_>"".  
   these words carry strong emotions and imply a negative situation, which is a typical indicator of sarcasm.

2. **context**: the sentence mentions having a child with a terminal disease and watching them probably die, describing a grim situation. the phrase ""soul mate"" is then used",1,"### response: 
the cues to determine sarcasm in the given text can be extracted as follows:

1. **common knowledge**: the statement ""my 'soul mate.'"" implies that soul mates are generally associated with positive qualities like unconditional love and support, which is known to be a common belief in romantic relationships.
2. **punctuation**: the use of ellipsis ""_"" before ""yeah,"" can indicate a pause or a tone of doubt or irony. also, the upward and downward arrows """,1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues that point towards sarcasm. 

- **topic**: the topic revolves around a life-altering, emotional situation - having a child with a terminal disease. usually, such situations do not lend themselves to sarcasm, but the tone of the text suggests otherwise.

- **cultural background**: the cultural background isn't significantly apparent in the text as it deals with a universally relatable situation of child-care and respect for personal choices over ""soul mates",1,1

1. **surface emotion**: the language used is informal and peppered with slangs (e.g., ""comrade"", ""good idea to"", ""nonsense"", ""jumping up and down"") and internet abbreviations, suggesting a casual or potentially sarcastic tone. the use of emoticons ('xbanghead' and 'xkill') further adds to the informal and casual vibe.

2. **topic**: the topic is politically inclined",1,"'sarcastic'

### explanation:

1. **punctuation**: the text uses emoticons (e.g., `xbanghead`, `xkill`) after strongly worded statements, hinting at sarcasm to convey emotions. there are also extended pauses or rhetorical questions (`anywho comrade`), which often indicate sarcasm.

2. **surface emotion**: there is a juxtaposition between the emoticon `xbanghead`, which typically represents anger or shock, and the seemingly absurd line",1,### label: sarcastic,1,1

the input text uses several cues that can point towards sarcasm:

1. emotional contrasts: the phrase ""aww"" often implies a warmer negative or contrasting sentiment, which is being used to create a humorous misdirection.
2. common knowledge: referring to someone as a ""damn limey"" and using terms like ""board nanny"" which are derogatory and associated with british stereotypes.
3. cultural background: terms like ""old chap"" and ""famous limey quote",1,"cultural background: the use of phrases like ""noggin"", ""damn limey board nanny"", and ""old chap"" are british slang, indicating a cultural background.

punctuation: emoticon ""xxx-umed"" is used, which adds sarcasm by mimicking the act of assuming or thinking incorrectly.

1. **cultural background**: the phrase ""because this man said it"" could be interpreted as a reference to cultural norms where authority figures are disproportionately listened to. however, without additional context, it's hard to pinpoint a specific cultural background. in this modern setting, this phrase may not carry as heavy cultural-specific implications.

2. **emotional words**: the text is tone-deaf and impersonal, not",1,"### response: 

cues extracted:
- special symbols: none
- topic: argumentative language (""because"", ""it must be true"", ""appeal to authority"")
- cultural background: the sarcasm is subtle and not overtly reliant on cultural references that might be specific to one cultural group
- punctuation: question mark at the end, which is part of the irony (""because this man said it, it must be true?"")
- language style: the language style is formal and argument",1,"### response: 

the input text contains multiple cues typically associated with sarcasm. firstly, it employs a rhetorical device - an appeal to authority, by using the phrase ""because this man said it, it must be true"". this is used to imply that just because someone is an authority figure, their statements are assumed to be true, which is a common form of sarcasm when the speaker means to say the opposite. 

the use of the term ""must"" intensifies the sarcastic tone,",1,1

the input text uses informal language style with the use of internet slang (""last thursdayism"") and includes a question mark, which can indicate a casual tone. it also includes a double negative (""truly know""), a common device in sarcasm. the topic is a hypothetical scenario about not being able to know something, which might be another aspect of sarcasm, as it doesn't take a direct opposing viewpoint, which is a key characteristic of sarcasm.

### label: sarcast",1,"### response: 

since the input text contains a reference to a fictional or possibly irregular ""last thursdayism,"" which is not part of common knowledge, and includes a rhetorical question marked by an emotional contrast (""if you mean this...""), it seems to be intended as a playful or ironic comment. the inclusion of ""truly know"" with the implication of uncertainty also aligns with the style of sarcasm.

### label: 
sarcastic",1,"### response: 

punctuation: the sentence ends with a period followed by a comma, which might indicate a casual or conversational tone that could be inverted for sarcastic effect. the construct to emphasize ""last thursdayism"" with the incredulous phrase ""truly know"" also plays with punctuation (capital letters), suggesting potential sarcasm.

emotional contrasts: the sentence uses a contrast in emotion where the speaker is pretending to joke about the notion of not knowing something, which could be relied upon as",1,1

the individual seems conflicted between what is expected (allies should be friendly) and what is observed (an opponent is friendlier than an ally). the use of 'sad' could potentially be ironic, hinting that the speaker is amused or dismayed by the situation rather than genuinely sad.

the text employs a sarcastic tone towards the notion of differing opinions on war and personal values. the surface emotion can be interpreted as mockery or disdain for a simplistic viewpoint that categorizes the discussion into 'patriotic' and 'anti-life'. cultural background seems to be deeply intertwined with american values and political discourse, with references to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness', phrases taken from the us declaration of independence.

the provided input text contains a few cues that might help classify it as sarcastic or not. let's break down these cues:

### surface emotion:
- the speaker's tone could be perceived as mild disappointment or exasperation with the reference to the child-like or simplistic ""they started it"" response, and the religious reference (jesus turning the other cheek) might be seen as sarcasm-laden because of the context.

### keywords:
- ""ever popular 3rd grade",1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues that can help classify it as sarcastic. firstly, the reference to the ""ever popular 3rd grade 'they started it' response"" implies a commentary on the simplicity or immaturity of such statements perhaps using a more sophisticated or adult perspective. this could indicate a juxtaposition of intellectual or emotional maturity with the naivety or inadequacy of the response it references, conveying a form of derision or mocking irony. 

secondly,",1,"### response: 

the use of quotes around ""they started it"" and the reference to jesus suggest a mocking tone. the reference to ""3rd grade"" implies an underlying derision. additionally, the entire sentence has a questioning and ironic undertone which is common in sarcasm. keywords like ""ever popular"" and ""didn't jesus say"" also indicate an emotional contrast where what is being claimed is actually the opposite of what is meant. the context and usage of\\. mark also adds to",1,1

- **surface emotion**: the sentence suggests a tone of disappointment or frustration, as it implies that the person being addressed presumably lacks a basic reading skill.

the topic of the text is sexuality, specifically referencing homosexuality. the cultural background implies a somewhat antagonistic or challenging one, perhaps from a heteronormative or religious perspective.

the text employs several rhetorical devices such as sarcasm, irony, and rhetorical questions. the surface emotion displayed in the text is frustration or annoyance. emotional words used are ""pompous"", ""still get it wrong"", and ""retarted"". the cultural background seems to center around discussions about the age of the universe versus the age of the earth. common knowledge in this text revolves around scientific facts about the age of the universe and the age of the earth. 

### label",1,"### response: 

this text uses a tone of irony and humor by describing someone's argumentative input as ""pompous"", ""wrong"", hypothetical claims that ""would just be retarded"", and urging the person to ""check your facts"", while acknowledging the complexity of the topic being discussed. this tone is likely intended to imply the writer's belief that the point being made is not valid, all in a playful and mannered way, which typically characterizes sarcasm.

in the context of this sentence, sarcasm seems to be intended, as the phrasing and tone suggest the opinion is not genuine, but rather a critique in a possibly condescending or mocking manner.

### cues:

- **context:** a statement about a person's writing ability containing a veiled warning or criticism.
- **emotional contrasts:** the use of the word ""gibberish"" implies mocking, while ""try to be more careful"" suggests a desire",1,"### response: not sarcastic

### reasoning:
the text provided doesn't contain any cues that distinguish it as sarcasm. phrases like ""be more careful in the future"" and ""read like gibberish"" suggest frustration or lack of understanding, rather than the intended in-joke or deliberate misinterpretation usually found in sarcastic remarks. the ""fail to complete the thought"" could mean the person on the receiving end has not finished a post or comment properly. the ""try",0,"### punctuation: 
the text ends with '.', indicating a statement rather than a question or an exclamation, which are often used in sarcastic statements. 

### context:
the context appears to be a statement directed to someone who failed to complete a thought, suggesting frustration or disappointment.

the language style is direct, confrontational, and implies criticism, which is not a typical feature of sarcasm.

### cues:

1. **rhetorical devices**: the use of parallelism (""legend in your own lunchtime, but archie has you roundly eclipsed"") and exaggeration (""in the credibility stakes"")- these rhetorical flourish are often used to express irony, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.
   
2. **surface emotion**: the phrase ""inconv""e""nient."" at the end with intentional misspelling (""inconvienient"")",1,"### response: 

the input text uses a formal language style, employing more sophisticated vocabulary and tone. the topic is likely about comparing two entities, perhaps individuals, possibly in a context of their credibility or influence ('legend in your own lunchtime', 'roundly eclipsed', 'credibility stakes'). keywords include 'legend', 'eclipsed', 'credibility', 'mistaken', 'grasshoppers', 'crickets', 'noisily', and 'irritatingly'.",1,"### response: 

the cues from the input text suggest the following:

- **language style:** the text uses formal and somewhat mocking language, hinting at sarcasm, with the use of words like ""legend,"" ""eclipsed,"" ""credibility stakes,"" and a subtle sequel misuse (""inconv""e""nient."") - details that point to formal politeness combined with irony.

in this text, several cues can be extracted to determine that it is sarcastic:

cultural background: this text exists in a socio-cultural context where science and religion have been major trending topics, given how much rigor is applied to scientific theory and the multiple tangling of religious (& spiritual) and societal systems throughout cultures.

special symbols: there are no special or obvious symbolic constructions to indicate sarcasm in this particular text. however, sarcasm is typically implied through word choice",1,"### response: 

this text employs several cues that suggest sarcasm:
- **punctuation**: the sarcastic tone is enhanced by the use of bold text and aggressive language, such as ""cast doubt"" and ""viable alternative"". such forceful language is uncommon in non-sarcastic, direct statements.
- **common knowledge**: the sentence ""teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically",1,"### response: 

the input text uses condescending language (""perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically"") and makes a comparison between science and ""magic"", which is a hyperbolic and potentially humorous way of describing something defy scientific explanation. the text also implies a level of humor or irony by suggesting there is an attempt to undermine ""well-established scientific theory"" and present ""magic"" as an alternative, despite the common understanding that this is not feasible.

### cues:
- **cultural background:** the mention of ""institution"" may suggest a context where ""institution"" is used metaphorically to refer to a restrictive place, possibly relating to a mental institution or a very controlled environment. the phrase ""gansao"" could indicate a cultural reference, likely filipino slang for an overactive, energetic, or mischievous term (like ""naughty"" or ""naughty boy/girl"").

cues:
- punctuation: period at the end of the sentence.
- emotional words: none explicitly mentioned, but ""insisting"" could imply emphasis or forcefulness which is often a cue for sarcasm.

this sentence uses profanity ('xxxxx') and employs a rhetorical question to emphasize the point. the tone is confrontational, and the use of the double negative (""again"") might be perceived as ironic, suggesting that the speaker is complaining about a repetitive behavior. however, without additional context, it's hard to determine sarcasm. common knowledge suggests that people might use sarcasm when they're annoyed by something repeated unnecessarily.
