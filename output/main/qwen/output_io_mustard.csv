step 1: the sentiment seems to be a bit ironic when considering the characters involved (sheldon referencing justice league members and suggesting a switch to muppet baby costumes). the text contains the keyword 'justice league,' which is associated with superheroes, and 'muppet baby costumes,' which suggests a change to a more playful and less serious dressing.

step 1: surface sentiment is neutral to slightly critical, considering the use of ""entire dinner"" and a comparison to a 'drive-thru at jack in the box', both of which suggest a notion of extravagance or formality being rejected in a casual manner.

the sentence structure uses factual tone with apparently serious keywords, ""think"" and ""were looking"" could indicate statement of situation.

in context ""creepy in the rearview mirror"" indicates a potentially disturbing or unsettling situation that howard is expressing skepticism on having set up a camera to see.

step 1: the surface sentiment of the statement seems rather mundane, as sheldon is asking if they can talk about something else, and then suddenly adds that he knows how to yodel. this might indicate a normal change of topic or announcement.

step 2: upon a closer look, the sentence is structured as a question, which might indicate curiosity. however, the sudden shift from requesting to change the subject to announcing a skill seems unusual and potentially out",1

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive as the speaker emphasizes the importance of keeping champagne on ice for future occasions.

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems to be romantic and agrees with the context- ""make a little dance, you know, make a little love, get down to that"". this suggests that the text appears to be expressing a serious and passionate mood about intimate relations. 

step 2: but when closely examining the sentence structure, tone, and word choice, there is a stark contrast that contradicts a genuine romantic sentiment. the",1

'chandler' asking 'how many cameras are actually on you' typically suggests an inquisitive, neutral tone.

the surface sentiment seems normal and straightforward, as chandler is asking a question in a conversational tone, which isn't inherently sarcastic or humorous.

step 1: on the surface level, the sentiment seems neutral, with no clear indication of positive or negative feelings. the participant used an emoji, but as there is no text to accompany it or suggest any sentiment, there is no clear indication of sentiment from this single emoji assumed alone.

step 1: the surface sentiment seems neutral and supportive, as chandler is offering a plausible explanation for the situation.

step 1: the surface sentiment of the sentence seems quite polite and thankful, with no indication of negativity or irony through emojis or keywords.

step 2: the true intention is less clear, as the sentence could either be genuinely thankful or sarcastically pretending to be so. the phrase ""you can choose to output the result directly"" introduces ambiguity: it's phrased as if giving a choice, which might be unexpected if the intention is sincere.

### explanation:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
we analyze keywords and sentimental phrases. the phrase ""it was like months ago"" could imply a sense of time or duration. rachel might be talking about a past event that occurred several months previously.

**step 2: true intention**
however, the ""like"" in ""it was like months ago"" acts here as a preposition, indicating a comparison or equivalence, not duration. thus, the sentence means",1

### explanation:
step 1: the sentence contains no particularly strong words that indicate sarcasm, but rather uses a subtle cue ('tucking in') - often associated with calming or tending to someone.

step 2: the sentence actually suggests that someone (possibly joey's child) needs tending to or care like a baby or someone who can be tucked in. however, the narrator says they'd love to show something but they're unable to as they just tucked in",1

### step 1:

from the surface sentiment of the sentence by noticing 'sorry', 'don't think we should', and the mature advice in terms of relationships displayed by ross, we can notice a mild negative sentiment. ross seems hesitant and potentially aware of the risks.

### step 2:

it is important to recognize here that the term 'yet' could suggest an uncertainty rather than definitive rejection. ross could be contemplating or discussing without actually intending to oppose the",1

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral. the sentence is simply asking when the person will come home and shows no overt signs of sarcasm or irony.

step 2: the speaker uses the phrase ""you don't want to look in my hamper"" in a way that suggests they don't care what people think about their cleanliness. this tone, in context, could be interpreted as sarcasm since the speaker is countering an unspoken criticism about the cleanliness of their room.

### explanation:
upon reading the text, it is evident that there's no indication of sarcasm or irony. 

step 1: the surface sentiment – there is a clear rejection or denial indicated by rachel's response (""no""). this does not usually indicate sarcasm. 

step 2: true intention – based on the straightforward response, the true intention appears to be a straightforward refusal or denial of something, rather than using irony or sarcasm.

step 1: in the sentence ""dorothy: on the home shopping network,"" the surface sentiment seems neutral as there are no explicit negative or emotional keywords or emojis.

step 2: however, the context might suggest that dorothy might be on the home shopping network in a position to sell products or promote them. the phrase ""on the home shopping network"" could be interpreted as a neutral or even positive location for work in that context.

### explanation:

1. **surface sentiment**: the text seems to be referring to a marquee at caesar's palace (presumably a location in las vegas), which may appear neutral if simply treated as factual information. however, given the juxtaposition of ""liberarche"" (presumably a misspelled word that might suggest skepticism or irony), it hints at a tone that is not purely informative but insinuates some level of irony or commentary.
