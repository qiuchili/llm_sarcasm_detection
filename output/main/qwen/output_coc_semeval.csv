### reasoning process:

step 1: the surface sentiment is determined by keywords and tone, such as ""@callisto1947 can u help?"" seems to be a request for assistance or a plea. the phrase ""get paid for posting stuff like this"" could be considered a hint of sarcasm if the intent is not to actually be paid for such an action.

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems to be positive, as the user states that ""corny jokes are my absolute favorite"". the use of excessive enthusiasm often hints at sarcasm.

step 2: upon closer inspection, the sentence might be intended rhetorically, implying that under usual circumstances, the user might not consider corny jokes their favorite. the juxtaposition between the strong positive statement and the potential actual sentiment could indicate irony.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems to be complaining or frustrated, with phrases like ""people complain about my background pic"" and ""all i feel is like"". nevertheless, the emojis and hashtags like '#sarcasm' are key indicators that the sentiment might be sarcastic.

### explanation:

step 2: however, considering the context of the account and hashtag (@sr_duncan being a tactical communications expert), along with the use of the @ tag suggesting a conversational element, the true intention is likely one of irony, given the request asking ""darn, my sock joke needs fixing?"" is in",1

step 1: the surface sentiment is quite negative, indicated by the keyword ""no sugar during christmas time?"" and the sad crying emoji. people usually consume a lot of sugar during christmas time due to the various sweet foods and drinks, making this statement look like an expression of negative feeling.

step 2: considering the specific phrase ""no sugar during christmas time?"" and the context of christmas, the sentence seems to be applying a hypocrisy or irony rather than a genuine negative feeling",1

justification:
step 1: the surface sentiment here is anger and concern over lack of sympathy for ""our"" people killed in terror attacks. the phrase ""#irony"" at the end hints at a deeper interpretation.

step 2: the true intention of the sentence is to highlight the irony and hypocrisy in the situation, criticizing those who do not show sympathy for the deaths, seemingly making a statement about the double standards or misplaced priorities some seem to hold.

step 1: surface sentiment analysis:
the keywords in the sentence include ""my mum to be back with us"" and the emoji "".gif"", which typically appear during celebrations such as christmas. these clues suggest that the user might be excited or longing for their mother to return for christmas.

upon a closer look, the context and tone take an interesting turn when we notice that this is posted by ""@riofer",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment

the input is a series of bulleted points, which typically imply a list format. the first point floats the idea that the reference person has 'white skin' or 'racist dna'. considering the context and the use of ""@yourperson"" and ""#"" symbols, it seems the speaker is directed at one of these accounts. the use of a lengthy sentence, followed by a mention of the recipient’s profession as a",1

step 1: the surface sentiment seems casually positive, with words like 'happy', 'morning', and symbols like '#'. however, this is somewhat neutral due to the coincidence of upbeat words in a typical greeting or announcement.

step 2: upon closer inspection, the true intention in the context of this seemingly cheerful message seems markedly opposite. the user is essentially begging not to be disturbed (""do not wake up""), using joyous greeting terms (""good morning"",",1

2. **true intention**: however, the phrase ""we must be twins"" is often used as an exaggeration or an idiom to say that the speaker and the recipient share a lot, but it can also be used in a sarcastic way to imply that while",1

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""being a light sleeper is the best"" contains no explicit linguistic indicators or expressions that denote sarcasm. ""best"" in this context is used in its positive literal sense and not in a negative, ironic manner.

### reasoning:

let's go through the 3-step process:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment?  
the surface sentiment seems neutral; the text is simply asking someone to email or dm them referring to a previous conversation or issue. there might be a bit of frustration about not getting a reply, but this is fairly common in the tone when referencing a lack of response to a previous message or request, not indicative of sarcasm in itself.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment could be interpreted as negative or neutral, with the emoji clearly suggesting sadness, coupled with the context of 'reunited with my pump'.

### explanation:

step 1: surface sentiment - the keywords in the sentence point towards a negative sentiment, as the user is referring to working while sick and stating ""it didn't suck at all."" the use of 'not worth it' also suggests a negative outcome.

step 2: true intention - despite the negative outcome (working while sick), the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" indicates that the actual sentiment is contrary to what is literally being said.

        ### explanation:

        ### step 1: surface sentiment identification
        the words used here contain strong disapproval, such as 'liberated' being used rhetorically in a negative way, seeming mock enthusiasm with phrases like 'thank you, western liberators'. the absence of emojis also indirectly suggests an ironic or sarcastic tone.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is quite plainly negative. words such as ""rubbish,"" ""not good enough,"" and ""gutted"" clearly suggest dissatisfaction or disappointment. the emoji #gutted further reinforces this notion of emotional despair.

step 2: instead of emotionally expressing that they are disappointed with the situation, the author uses words that indicate the opposite sentiment - ""easiest"" and ""won only 1 cl",1

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral as there are no overtly emotional indicators or emojis.

after carefully analyzing the input text, it's clear that the surface sentiment is one of longing and yearning for connection with people who are not eager to connect. this sentiment is conveyed by the hashtags ""#""irony"" and ""why oh why?"" and potentially by the use of an ellipsis at the end, implying that no one fulfills this desire.

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems to be positive and enthusiastic, as indicated by phrases like ""got the world on a string"" and ""#whatamidoing"". phrases like ""cool applications"" also align with a positive sentiment.

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be negative due to words like ""slow,"" ""losing brain cells."" the presence of hashtags like #irony further indicates playfulness or humor.

### explanation:

step 1: on the surface, the text appears enthusiastic and supportive. keywords such as ""favorites,"" ""should go all out"" and phrases like ""one of my favorites"" indicate a positive sentiment.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment
the word 'lazying' usually has a negative connotation as it implies someone who is not being productive. this paired within the hashtag '#wintertimes', which typically acknowledges a seasonal experience evoking feelings of settling in and coziness. overall, given these keywords, one would perceive this as a slightly negative sentiment expressing a desire (or circumstance) to lounge around in a hoody during winter.

step 2: however, when carefully examining the text, there are indications that the true intention is the opposite of the surface sentiment. the user mentions functioning on ""literally 4 hours of sleep,"" which suggests they are exhausted. the hashtags ""#not #collegeiskillingme",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is condescending and mocking. phrases like ""#irony"" and ""little man (hacker) won"" imply that the speaker believes the opposite of what is being stated. for example, criticizing those who claim ""anti-state"" when in reality stating that ""the state won"" can be read as a mocking tone.

step 1: the表面 sentiment appears to be questioning or inquiring, where the person is asking if someone has visualized the variations in color and flavors of twitter streams, comparing it to a lip gloss test.

step 2: upon closer inspection, the sentence seems to be using the rhetorical device of hyperbole (comparing twitter streams to a lip gloss test) to convey the frustration or annoyance the speaker feels towards the monitoring of social media content in a very exaggerated manner",1

step 1: surface sentiment analysis gives us a picture of the words used and the emojis which indicate something to the contrary. 'blue skies', 'warm air', and 'royal accommodation' are usually associated with a positive sentiment, often describing a luxurious, desirable or favored state. however, there's no actual emoji to indicate any anger, sarcasm or irony but it typically isn't necessary as sarcasm can be conveyed through written text.",1

### reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment - on the surface, the text expresses a sense of unwillingness or complaint. the noticable keyword ""not!"" signals the speaker's discord with the situation, with particular preferences for time (3 pm to 8 pm) and commitment with a son.

step 2: true intention - when carefully examining the text, it appears as though the speaker is engaging in hyperbole, or exaggeration, for comedic",1

step 2: the true intention of the sentence is to express annoyance or frustration at being lied to, which is the opposite of what the phrases before 'not' would suggest.

step 1: surface sentiment of the text does not exhibit strong emotions like surprise, excitement, or anger, which are typical of sarcastic language.

step 2: the true intention seems to be suggesting something contrary to the surface message. the user talks about retaining someone at maximum, but later implies the negligence could be beneficial in some way, possibly doubting the decision made.

step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be proud or confident, as indicated by the phrase ""on my playlist naw"" accompanied by capital letters, which could be interpreted as confidence ('yay! i added this song to my playlist!').

step 2: however, given the context and style of delivery, it's clear there's likely sarcasm. mentioning ""forest hills drive"" as a song to add to a playlist might imply a lack of original",1

step 1: in this text, there seems to be a negative sentiment expressed, particularly by the keyword ""irony"" and the phrase ""to live in peace."" the hashtag ""#yclnationalcongress"" suggests it could be a political context, where ideas are intertwined with personal or group benefits.

step 2: the phrase ""people are not fighting for ideas, they fight for material benefits."" appears to use irony as it contrasts with the idea that people",1

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems positive, with keywords like ""devoted"" and praise for being a ""boss in beating corruption"". there are also hashtags like #irony and #soclosetilden suggesting a touch of humor.

step 2: upon careful reading, the true intention breaks down the apparent positivity. the narrator is expressing frustration over losing an election despite their efforts against corruption, using irony (""#irony"") to highlight the unexpected outcome",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be negative and probably concerned with criticism towards schools. the keyword ""gays"" and usage of ""#sarcasm"" suggest a playful or possibly mocking tone.

step 2: considering the context, the sentence is making a bold claim that ""kids don't need schools"" and implying schools merely convert them to ""gay atheists"". this usage of bold and exaggerated claims combined with the hashtag ""#sarcasm""",1

step 2: upon careful reading, the phrase ""shitty drivers are always fun"" seems to be a hyperbolic statement. the user is exaggerating the negative sentiment of having bad drivers on the road to likely emphasize the annoyance or frustration.

step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, while the surface sentiment is negative, the",1

step 1: the surface sentiment seems neutral since the text does not explicitly indicate any strong emotion or tone. the keywords 'finish fourth' and hashtags like '#irony', '#arsenal', '#afc' might indicate a context related to football, but reveal nothing about the sentiment.

step 2: upon closer examination, the text can be interpreted as a statement related to arsenal football club's finishing position in a competition, suggesting they could achieve fourth place. however,",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive. the speaker seems enthusiastic about things going slowly. keywords like ""also"" and ""especially"" suggest a sense of agreement and experiencing the situation simultaneously, indicating a friendly, enthusiastic tone.

step 2: however, the true intention behind the statement is contradictory. generally, when it comes to waiting for something, people would like things to go quickly rather than slowly, indicating frustration or annoyance with the situation.",1

step 2: however, considering the context, the user is talking about loving moments when their partner is doing the cleaning—usually seen as a chore. the use of 'love it' in this context and 'on a cleaning spree' are somewhat contradictory when viewed through a positive light, suggesting irony.

the sentiment appears to be quite positive with the inclusion of '#not' at the end which is meant to indicate irony or counter-effect. the use of words like 'shaking/quaking in his boots' also implies surprise possibly in a positive light.

step 1: surface sentiment appears negative, as indicated by strong negative keywords and phrases such as ""i love doing this"" when contrasted with the phrase ""my favorite thing"" and ""bitch ass"". there are no emojis provided in the text, otherwise, they could help support the sentiment.

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is neutral. keywords 'speaker', 'talk's over', and hashtag '#sarcasm' provided by the user indicate the context, but do not inherently suggest sentiment.

step 2: upon reading the sentence closely, the phrase ""it's so the speaker remembers their talk's over. otherwise how would they know?"" appears to question the necessity of an indicator for when a speech ends, suggesting the speaker might",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems negative. phrases like ""yuk .. so naff"" indicate that the speaker is not enthused about something.

step 2: the use of the hashtag ""#not"" at the end of the sentence could be an indicator sarcasm. it suggests that the speaker is pretending to not mean what their words otherwise strongly imply. the sentence, ""@andygreencre8iv @_barryisland_ pulled by",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment can be initially interpreted as negative, due to the mention of soreness and the forthcoming work being seen as 'fun'. keywords and sentiments (""sore"", ""fun"") connotate dissatisfaction or displeasure.

step 2: the phrase ""work tomorrow is gonna be fun.."" is presented in a tone that uses sarcasm, subtly exaggerating the notion that work might be enjoyable after experiencing soreness. the hashtag ""#",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be negative. this is indicated by the use of keywords such as ""lost a fiver"" (losing money), and the phrase ""cheers forrest"" (apparently sarcastic).

step 2: the sentence is structured to appear as if it is earnestly lamenting a financial loss. the use of the phrase ""thanks forrest"" in a seemingly serious context might hint at sarcasm, as forrest is",1

step 1: the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, and emojis in the sentence is nostalgic and positive. the use of hashtags ""#goodtimes"" and the mentioning of ""buffet / steve miller concert"" and mud sliding down a hill create a tone that suggests a reminiscence of the past with a sense of enjoyment and warmth.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems quite urgent and possibly frustrated or impatient, based on the use of 'please' and the request related to exiting dance early. emoticons could further indicate this.

step 2: upon closer examination, the text employs a begging tone (""please snow""), which is seemingly unrealistic and possibly a rhetorical device to exaggerate a request. the juxtaposition of ""let us get out of dance early"" doesn't make logical sense",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of this text can be interpreted as inspirational and motivational, as indicated by the 'monday morning inspiration' and hashtag #sarcasm removing any doubt about this initial thought.

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment is negative, with words like ""annoying"" that imply displeasure with one's mother.
step 2: however, the tone of the text becomes overtly positive when the author adds, ""i know you're gonna read this since you creep my account"" and ""s/o to my mom,"" which suggests a form of playful annoyance or spite towards someone who has been secretly reading their text.

step 1: **surface sentiment**
the keywords in this sentence are ""no doubt"", ""main stream media"", ""obama"", ""holder"", ""deblasio et al"", ""blood of those cops on their hands"". the tone and language used here do not indicate sarcasm at first glance. the speaker seems to be stating a fact without any hints of irony or humor.

### step-by-step justification:

step 1: the surface sentiment

the phrase ""it's always the little things that's attracts me"" contains unusual grammar with a repeated ""s"" in ""little things"" which might be a typo or perhaps a tongue twister. however, the word 'attracts' is used in an unusual context without a subject typically preceding or following it, which could be seen as a stylistic choice suggesting a deviation from standard grammar. depending",1

### step-by-step response:

step 1: surface sentiment - the words used (""#not familiar"", ""#then"", ""lol"") give a mixed sentiment. it could potentially be taken as a slight rebuff, though ""lol"" is typically used to express laughter or amusement.
step 2: true intention analysis - contextual clues like the assumed identities (""@manutdholder @hunts9"") suggest part of a conversation amongst football club supporters. """,1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment is quite positive. keywords such as ""think about disney world just about every day,"" ""miss it,"" and ""my happy place"" indicate a strong affection and nostalgia.

step 2: however, when analyzing the tone and context, the phrase ""just about every day"" might be exception or exaggeration, often used in sarcastic or humorous context to emphasize something ironic or contrary. the use of hashtags like #missit",1

### step 2: 

upon closer inspection, the language style and rhetorical devices indicate that the true intention is the opposite of what the surface sentiment suggests. the speaker is mocking and sarcastically thanking ""@askplaystation""",1

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral. the text consists of just a straightforward date and time mention, and a greeting, without any strong emotion or irony-indicating keywords or phrases.

step 1: the surface sentiment looks straightforward and non-complimentary considering words used are ""determined"" and ""block"". a unique but associated term, ""#"" or ""notices"" introduces an additional layer of sarcasm syntax, often employed in humorous sarcasm online.

the surface sentiment can be seen as one of mocking or ridicule from the use of the hashtag #lol and the apparent irony and skepticism regarding the declaration about santa and the sky fairy.

step 1: the surface sentiment might be seen as a complaint or frustration since the speaker is pointing out that girls do not answer their phones when they are trying to call them for reasons they perceive as ironic (thinking it's an early call).

step 2: a closer reading reveals that the speaker is actually making a humorous joke. the phrase ""i'm calling them in early"" is contradictory to the main point of the sentence. what the speaker is really trying to say",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative due to the author mentioning irony and questioning the number of gods, which could imply a mocking tone.

step 2: the true intention seems to be an ironic or mocking statement. the keywords and hashtags suggest that the author is not genuinely surprised by the qb's tattoos but is instead pointing out the absurdity of someone with multiple god names tattooed on their body.
