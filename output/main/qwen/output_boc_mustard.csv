- **keywords**: keywords that clue into sarcasm in this sentence include ""so?""—which is used as a rhetorical question expecting an already obvious or absurd answer—and the expectation that the answer meant",1,"### instruction:
the task is to analyze the input text and classify if it's sarcastic or not. the classification should be based on cues from speech style, cultural context, punctuation, rhetorical devices, and surface emotion, and should be placed in one of two categories: 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic'.

1. **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""terrific"" to introduce a serious concern about penny not wanting leonard to go to the north pole is a stark opposition in tone and expectation, creating a rhetorical device of irony.

2. **emotional contrasts:** while leonard seems to express disappointment",1,"### response: 

this statement can be seen as sarcastic because the speaker, leonard, is using ridicule or irony to express his disinterest or dislike in going to the north pole, especially after sheldon's comments about comfort and leadership.

**language style**: the language used by the characters is somewhat casual and familiar, especially the use of contractions (""ain't"", ""don't""), which is typical of informal conversation.

raj's tone seems defensive and possibly apologetic, when he mentions being 'behind on his wiki-reading' and confesses to a 'john grisham kick', this could be seen as an attempt to lighten the heavy or potentially mocking tone that howard might have used earlier. so in terms of 'surface emotion', one can detect a hint of 'defensiveness/attempted轻松ness'.

### explanations:
#### surface emotion:
the text seems to imply mild sarcasm and teasing at leonard's work. ""third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels"" is often used to describe something not particularly impressive. the juxtaposition of sheldon’s acknowledgment that leonard’s work is ""amazing"" with the seemingly dismissive and trivial analogy suggests that he is intimating that leonard's work isn't truly exceptional.

### cues extracted:

- **language style**: the speaker uses casual and blunt language, which might imply sarcasm when used in a setting where others are discussing unusual animal genitals and distances themselves from such topics.
- **context**: the previous exchange involves colleagues discussing unconventional animal anatomy, a subject leonard appears to have had strong opinions about, especially if related to unusual or controversial aspects.
- **cultural background**: the conversational style among the group sounds",1,"### response: 

considering the exchange, leonard's statement comes after discussing unusual animal genitals and howard's question about giant rat's ass. leonard is trying to pivot the conversation. the cues extracted are:
- **rhetorical devices:** leonard's use of ""can we please..."" implies an excuse to change the subject, potentially in a more polite manner, albeit with clear nonchalance.
- **context:** the context is a conversation between friends who've recently discussed a seemingly irrelevant or unusual topic.",1,"### response: 

in this text, the speaker expresses disinterest in a particular topic and suggests shifting the conversation to something more pertinent. words like ""please"", ""something vaguely related"", and the sentiment of drifting off the unusual subject suggest a more neutral tone. however, without the context of preceding statements, one might infer sarcasm through the style or tone of delivery in a conversation, which isn't explicitly shown in this excerpt.

the input text carries a tone that is somewhat formal and serious, with a slight hint of awkwardness. the cultural background might refer to a common scenario in a workplace setting or a police procedural context. the linguistic cues suggest a straightforward and literal interpretation without strong emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices. normal common knowledge indicates the conversation might be between security personnel and another individual, possibly searching for credentials or verifying identities. 

### label: not sarcastic",0,"### response: 

since the speaker in the input text does not use any rhetorical devices or cultural references that would commonly be employed in sarcasm, and there is no emotional contrast presented which is typical in comedic sarcasm, the text seems to be straightforward and literal in its questioning. there are no keywords or common knowledge that would lend itself to sarcasm in this conversation context. 

### label: 

not sarcastic",0,"### context:
the context is a conversation between two individuals calling each other. the first individual introduces themselves as a special agent from the fbi by showing an id, and the second person responds by showing a justice league membership card, implying a play on superheroes despite the current situation being between two presumably human characters. the exchange continues with the second individual denying knowledge of batman. the context indicates someone attempting to establish their authority or expertise in a hypothetical situation, possibly spoofing authority figures or a legal setting.

### explanation:

1. **punctuation:** the use of quotations ("" "") around multiple different words and phrases adds a tone of exaggeration and self-awareness, a common facet of sarcastic expressions.
2. **emotional contrasts:** the speaker refers to ""the miller's tale"" as the ""dirtiest story"" and presents it as such with a straight face, which makes the sentiment ironic considering the listener knows the speaker is actually implying the opposite.",1,"### response: 

the input text uses a familiar and casual language style, employs a slightly humorous tone, includes the keyword ""dirty story"", and references ""the miller's tale"" by chaucer, a famously explicit and controversial story. the topic revolves around literature, particularly medieval literature, and the context is a conversation between two individuals discussing literature in a light-hearted manner.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### label: sarcastic

### cues extraction:

1. **punctuation**: the use of a period ('.') at the end of a sentence but not in accordance with standard english grammar often used to emphasize sarcasm. in the given text, the speaker mentions ""chaucer is the dirtiest story i know"" and then follows it with a playful joke about chaucer's works being hidden in ""sock drawers"" given the clothing styles of the 14th century.

### cues:

- keywords: ""science dudes"", ""talk science"", ""rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver""
- common knowledge: the phrase ""science dudes"" and mentioning ""rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver"" could suggest a comedic exaggeration related to stereotypical interests that howard might have.

- cultural background: not mentioned. notably american, given the usual american speech vernacular.
- topic: the topic revolves around science and passing a comment on it.
- emotional contrasts: the dialogue takes a shift where howard teases about the science topics, with penny's agreement sounding less enthusiastic towards the later topics.
- surface emotion: the emotion seems convoluted; it's playful and at the same time somewhat satirical. howard's tone can be read as mischievous",1,"### response: 

howard's statement is laden with exaggeration and irony, particularly noticeable through the use of informal language (""our friend the beaver""), and the emphasis on a mundane topic. his choice of words like ""want to talk science"" and suggestion of discussing ""rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver"" highlight a humorous contrast with the level of scientific complexity implied earlier in the conversation. this, combined with the casual, humorous tone, indicates sarcastic intent.

### cues extracted:
- **language style**: excessive use of exclamation points and informal language.
  
- **emotional contrasts**: utilization of ""oh, my god"" to express mild surprise or knowledge recognition. the tone seems exaggerated.
  
- **special symbols**: excessive punctuation marks to induce emphasis.

the input text uses a sudden change in tone and emotional contrast, potentially to emphasize humor. the language style here is somewhat exaggerated and comes across as overly enthusiastic, which could be a sign of sarcasm. the keyword ""oh, my god"" could be enhanced or exaggerated for comedic effect, particularly when coupled with ""i know you from"", which might imply familiarity which is not portrayed in a genuine or reflective manner.

1. **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions (""oh, how could i be so stu..."") can be seen as a device to highlight the absurdity or the speaker's disbelief, which is common in sarcastic statements.
2. **keywords**: words like ""ruse"", which is used here in a context suggesting the speaker is being deceived, and the befuddled ""stu..."" are potential markers of sarcasm",1,"### label: sarcastic

### extraction:

- **cultural background:** american, seemingly from a humorous context possibly within a television show or a similar setting.
- **rhetorical devices:** use of formal language and humor with a twist, the keyword ""ruse"" suggests deception. the immediate switch from formal to exaggerated, sarcastic tones after saying ""no,"" and the use of longer words like ""stu..."" and ""bubbeleh"" for comedic effect.
- **topic:**",1,"### context:
the context provided includes a conversation between characters named sheldon, bernadette, howard, and potentially others (referenced as 'bubbeleh'). they are engaging in a scenario that typically involves halloween traditions, likely including the activity of 'trick or treating'. the dialogue includes casual interactions laced with humor and interest in the topic at hand.

### explanation:
the given text reflects several cues that point towards sarcasm. the surface emotion appears detached and ironically positive. the speaker sarcastically acknowledges stuart's interest in amy by stating ""oh, of course he is."" this implies a disbelieving acknowledgment of a seemingly quirky or mundane reason for interest. 

another key cue is emotional contrasts, where the speaker contrasts the perceived novelty or strange nature of ""severing the webbing between her own toes"" with",1,"### cues identification:
- **emotional contrasts:** the intended sarcastic tone is conveyed through contrasting the casual, friendly vibe of descriptive speech (""you could have fun with that"") with sarcastic commentary (""stuart's kind of interested in amy"").
- **cultural background:** the situation places the characters, known to have academic backgrounds and intellectual dialogue, in a casual social setting (""you could have fun with that""), which can be familiar to those following the context of the characters' humor and",1,"### response: 

sheldon's statement about amy severing the webbing between her own toes at 14 seems peculiar and out of context. the use of ""oh, of course he is"" suggests a tone that might be mocking or exaggerated, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. additionally, mentioning a personal detail about someone's childhood might not typically be shared in a casual conversation, indicating a peculiar or unusual surface emotion. there are no immediately recognizable special symbols in this statement",1,1

well, the use of slangs, repetition (""cwaigswist""), and oxymorons (""high-wes"") along with the tone and context of personal and potentially offensive subject matter could indicate sarcasm. there seems to be an emotional contrast where the speaker's language and intended meaning appear to be opposite to their literal meaning. this context could suggest that the speaker is not actually pleased or happy.

### cues extracted:

* **common knowledge**: the casual conversation about potential job opportunities for home care indicates a realistic statement. however, in context, home care for 'the old and fat' is a figurative term thrust into an inappropriate conversation, which adds a layer of teasing or sarcasm",1,"### response: 

howard's statement implies that there are high-demand and interesting job opportunities in taking care of elderly and overweight individuals. the use of the word ""exciting"" indicates a positive outlook on the opportunities, whereas the phrase ""old and fat"" might be seen as feeding into stereotypes, which could carry a hint of sarcasm if the context suggests that this is not the typical positive spin one would expect on job prospects. it's also plausible that the tone is intentionally light-hearted or humorous,",1,1

### explanation:

in this response, there are two primary clues that point towards the classification of this text as sarcastic:

1. **keywords and emotions**: ""being 75"" is presented directly after mentioning amy being in charge of pricing, creating an emotional and unexpected contrast. it implies that amy, due to her proficiency in garage sales, should be around 75 instead of younger, suggesting a humorous and unexpected twist or irony.

### cues:

- **emotional contrasts:** the statement uses sarcasm to contrast amy's claim of having experience going to garage sales (""been going to garage sales my whole life"") with her absurd request to be ""in charge of pricing"" and her silly misunderstanding that 75 refers to her age, implying she is 75 years old, instead of suggesting she will price everything at $0.75.

**context:**  
a conversation between penny and leonard regarding leonard's mother's flight arrival. penny expresses curiosity about the exact time, while leonard shows a casual or detached response.

**emotional words:**  
""want to know for sure"" - penny's expression of curiosity or concern, showing her need for specific information.

**surface emotion:**  
penny's underlying emotion could be seen as concern or curiosity, while leonard's response seems indifferent or perhaps humorous.

### explanation:

**emotional contrasts:** penny’s direct and straightforward inquiries about leonard's mother's flight arrival time contrast with his off-hand and casual response, which implies he doesn't care about the exact arrival time. his response is out of character for how we might expect him to behave when someone he cares about is coming home, creating an emotional contrast.

* **rhetorical devices**: ""as soon as she flies into california airspace, i'll feel a disturbance in the force"" is a rhetorical device, a statement designed to evoke a reaction but which doesn't have a literal meaning. here, the phrase ""a disturbance in the force"" is taken from the star wars universe (jedi lore), but leonard's mother is not flying into california airspace. the implication is one of earnestness, even",1,1

first, let's extract the cues from the input text:

1. **surface emotion:** the sentence (""but younger than some buildings!"") is delivered in a matter-of-fact way, suggesting a neutral or indirect tone which is a common cue for sarcasm.

2. **cultural background:** the context isn't culturally specific, but the sarcasm likely involves a subtle comparison of age, comparing richard to buildings, which could imply an awareness of architectural longevity.

3. **",1,"### response: 

the input text ""chandler: but younger than some buildings!"" can be analyzed through various cues:

1. **keywords**: ""younger,"" ""buildings,"" which are unusual comparisons in a statement about age, hinting at sarcasm. in this context, ""younger"" is compared negatively, as it refers to age, while ""buildings"" are generally perceived as prolonged in existence and can symbolize history. therefore, this statement likely suggests a degree of disrespect",1,1

### explanation:

1. **topic**: the conversation revolves around a comical incident that was overheard at a party. the focus is on someone being intimate with another person on the speaker's balcony, which creates a mix between the mundane and intimate with the dramatic nature of the situation, hinting at a degree of sarcasm to de-emphasize the seriousness of the situation.

chandler exaggerates the situation, using ironically contrasting his previous conversation with monica about putting lights on their balcony with the current event of rachel kissing someone on their balcony. the use of ""seriously?"" in a sarcastic, not serious tone also hints at sarcasm. ""that's so funny"" could be seen as a sarcastic exaggeration, as the situation is actually quite serious.

chandler's statement is placing a humorous, exaggerated expectation on ross, suggesting a playful and nonsensical action with the phrase ""steal third"", which is not applicable in normal conversation unless referring to baseball. this is contrasted with the serious tone and direct address (using a person's name), creating an emotional and situational contrast. the lack of punctuation before ""and i'll go like this"" also implies a disjointed or unexpected action, commonly associated with sarcasm.",1,"### response:

language style: the sentence is in a casual, conversational style similar to that of a dialogue between friends. however, it becomes unexpected when chandler mentions wanting ross to steal third base, an action that would typically lead to him being out. this suggests a twist in the expected narrative, common in sarcastic discourse.

it seems like chandler is asking a seemingly random and non-scientific question about the boiling point of the human brain, which is not a real thing. it could be considered a playful and seemingly illogical inquiry, suggesting an attempt at humor or sarcasm.

### cues extracted:
- **language style**: playful, direct, and somewhat insulting at the same time.
- **topic**: questions about the physical properties of a human brain.
- **common knowledge**: the question",1,"### response: 

the speaker is asking an intentionally absurd question and referring to something as ""strange things"" which creates an emotional contrast with the expectation of a straightforward answer. the context involves a playful, teasing tone often associated with sarcasm. the keyword ""strange things"" and the tone of teasing suggest a lighter, ironic intent. the reference to something extraordinary (boiling point of brain) might be intended to be absurd and is a common rhetorical device in sarcastic language.

chandler's statement 'yes you can. you're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.' seems to be contradicting the previous conversation where monica asked if chandler could 'just go back a phase', implying a possible time-related paradox or misunderstanding. his response could be seen as sarcastic by implying the impossibility of time travel in a seemingly straightforward or obvious way, contradicting monica's assumption that time travel is conceivable.

chandler is using a rhetorical device by stating ""yes you can"" in a negative context, which might imply that they are indeed not able to go back in time. the use of double negative (""you're thinking about time, you can't go back in time."") creates a contradictory tone that is commonly associated with sarcasm. the phrase ""you're thinking about time, you can't go back in time."" also implies a common knowledge about the impossibility of time travel",1,"cultural background: the conversation is between two people, likely friends or family members, speaking in a casual and familiar tone. this suggests a context with a shared cultural background.

### cues:

1. **emotional contrasts:** the text mentions ""a lonely grey couch,"" which implies isolation. yet, the phrase ""o look"" and ""and then the kingdom was his"" creates a strong contrast by bringing a sudden change to an unexpected climax, suggesting a happier outcome than what was expected or presented. this emotional shift is a common marker of sarcasm.

### explanation:

#### rhetorical devices:
- the rhetorical question ""o look"" in quotation marks, which is typically used to express strong emotion or amazement, is added in a casual tone (""and then the kingdom was his""), which is ironic given the context.

- **keywords:** ""smokes"" and ""alone"" - the context suggests the ""alone"" might indicate a hint of paranoia",1,1

common knowledge (monkeys having rear ends), emotional contrasts (surprise or annoyance vs. laughing at the unconventional statement), punctuation (exclamation mark indicating strong emotion), cultural background (referring to ""ross"", a character from a popular show, indicative of a common cultural reference), rhetorical devices (the strange but humorous statement used to make a point or create a contrast in tone).

### label: sarcastic",1,"### response: 

this sentence uses ""ross"" in a non-literal way, referring to a significant object/person on the monkey's anatomy (in this case, the monkey having a resemblance to ross, possibly in fashion or style). it also employs casual, humorous language风格 which could be a cue for sarcasm. however, without broader contextual information or understanding the full context of the conversation, it's challenging to definitively label this as sarcasm or not. typically sarcastic language might include irony",1,"in order to assign a label whether the input text is sarcastic or not, we need to analyze the cues from the context and the input text.

- **punctuation**: excessive use of commas after every word, which in this context is not typical and emphasizes the elongated sound and feeling of parting words.
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""i doooo"" instead of ""i do"" implies either a slow delivery, self-doubt, sarcasm, or exaggeration, depending on the tone.

rachel's use of informal language, peculiar rephrasing (""dubbies""), and the detail that follows about clarification on marijuana cigarettes vs. ""dubbies"" suggests that she might be using language that is slightly exaggerated. however, without clear emotional contrasts or sarcasm indicators like a straight-faced statement in contrast to expected reaction, this might not be clear sarcasm but casual language.

ross is using exaggeration (""naked, greasy strangers"") and adding a specific situation (""when i want to kick back with a puzzle, beer! cold beer"") that contradicts his initial statement about wanting to come and go whenever he wants. additionally, he's emphasizing the unpleasant conditions of potential visitors by using the word ""greasy"" which is an emotional word and can add sarcasm to his statement.

phoebe's reaction (""i just don't know what",1,"### response:

ross's statement contrasts with the usual expectations of hospitality as he is expressing a negative sentiment towards the idea of other people being in his apartment, specifically when he desires to relax and enjoy personal leisure time. this emotional contrast, combined with his use of casual language and emphasis on avoiding nude, greasy individuals, creates a humorous situation. given the context and the tone, the input text can be labeled as sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### response:

ross's line uses ""the big deal"" with irony, as he does not genuinely care about people being naked and greasy. instead, he is hiding his true desire not to have people around when he wants to relax. contrasting emotions like annoyance and sarcasm are present, as he pretends to emphasize the problem while actually dismissing it.

the cues for sarcasm classification classifier in this situation are:

1. **rhetorical devices:** the use of mocking patterns through the characters' back-and-forth dialogue and the use of exclamations intentionally make the scene feel humorous and sarcastic.

ross is attempting to ratchet up the dramatic tension by casually suggesting they break into a seemingly empty property and propose an evasive explanation later, hinting at a situation fraught with risk or law-breaking. his unusual tone, consideration of a perilous act, and delivery (""when you get in there"") which seems more menacing than helpful all contribute to a potential sarcasm. joe's straightforward response (""really? no one's home?"") invites skepticism to the proposition thus confirming an overt hint",1,"### response:

### reasoning:

1. **language style**: the core statements are straightforward (""all right, okay, well"") but followed by an unexpected twist (""apparently not""). this style of incongruent language is often associated with sarcasm as it implies the speaker's negative attitude or disbelief under the guise of neutrality or agreement.

2. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""apparently not"" is heavily employed, starting with a mild, neutral ""apparently",1,"### response:

- ""unbearable living situation""

topic:

emotional words:

grounded in a scenario where a character, phoebe, weighs in on a friend's interest regarding drumming, there's a sense of initial concern about possible negative outcomes- most notably, believing it could lead to an ""unbearable living situation."" this setup creates a discrepancy as expectations versus reality contrast.

based on the context, the cues provided are:

1. **topic**: the topic is interpersonal communication, specifically related to apologies and attempted clarification in a situation involving physical contact.

2. **punctuation**: the input uses a combination of punctuation - specifically commas and an exclamation point, which can indicate a mix of anxiety, urgency, and possibly frustration.

3. **context**: the context suggests a scenario where someone, presumably rachel, has accidentally touched something or someone else and is",1,"### response: 

rachel's use of trivial, almost comically exaggerated reactions (""oh god i'm sorry! oh god, i'm sorry!""), while also attempting to correct herself (""i mean""), along with the lack of a clear, direct sarcasm indicator like a rhetorical question or hyperbole, might suggest a tone of playfulness or humor. however, without clear sarcasm indicators it's hard to diagnose with certainty. 

### label: not sarcastic",0,"### response: 

rachel's use of ""oh god i'm sorry"" in a seemingly inappropriate context and the unexpected shift in tone create a sense of emotional contrast, suggesting sarcasm. the repetition of ""i'm sorry"" in a response that is not related to the actual event of an apology further highlights this contrast, a common rhetorical device in sarcasm. additionally, the use of an exclamation point emphasizes this tone.

in the given input, there seems to be no special symbols, emotional words, keywords that could directly indicate sarcasm. however, a typical recognition of sarcasm in conversation context may involve words like 'so', 'but', or 'almost' used in a context where the actual intention is the opposite ('completely', 'thankfully', 'maybe', etc.). in this case:

### explanation:

**cues for sarcasm:**

1. **keywords:** the presence of ""but then, i decided to take it to the next step"" can imply sarcasm since it suggests that starting to build a small place for mail was not the end of joey's plans, but it inherently mocks or belittles those initial intentions.
         
2. **language style:** the tone shifts unexpectedly from the seemingly simple act of building a place for mail",1,"### response: 

""it's impressive to see you taking the initiative to build not just a simple mailbox, but an entire post office. your dedication to organizing our mailbox needs is commendable.""

the cues from the input text for sarcasm classification are:

- **emotional contrasts:** ""fulfilling their christmas"" - the word 'fulfilling' contrasts the usual tone of fulfilling something negative, suggesting criticism rather than appreciation.

- **keywords:** ""look now, phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling",1,"### response:

based on the provided input text and following the instructions, let's analyze the given cues:

- **topic**: it's a conversation between joey and phoebe in a context that involves discussing christmas, possibly expressing sentiments or actions related to christmas traditions or christmas spirit.

the cues extracted from the input text are:

1. **emotional contrasts**: the speaker (dorothy) philosophically contrasts the act of finding something with hiding it again immediately, which is unexpected and contradictory if not intended to be viewed as humorous.

2. **language style**: the use of a specific tone that implies some playful frustration or sarcasm is evident through the inclusion of ""but now"" and the repetition of ""you can find her"", adding an ironic twist",1,"for the given input text, here are the classifications and justifications:

### cues extracted: 

1. **emotional words:** none as the text seems neutral and direct. however, ""hidden"" might indicate a bit of intrigue or surprise, but it's hard to pinpoint strong emotion.
2. **keywords:** 'you', 'found', 'her', 'half hour ago', 'hidden', 'again', 'find her' - these are functional protocols in the sentence rather than standing",1,"### cues extraction:
1. **common knowledge**: the text does not contain any surprising fact or deep context that directly leads to a situation that requires sarcasm for it to make sense. normal listeners would not feel the need for sarcasm, as it contains a straightforward statement.
2. **keywords**: 'oh yes', 'hidden her again', 'you can find her' - this tone and vocabulary outline a playful, maybe teasing nature rather than genuine information or sincere surprise. it could indicate that",1,1

### label: sarcastic

### explanation:

- **punctuation**: in a sarcastic tone, one might use exaggerated punctuation to emphasize the irony or humor in the statement. in the given text, ""i don't know rose, maybe marry poppins has an italian cousin"" uses the semi-colon after ""rose,"" which could be used to underscore the absurdity of the following question or to introduce a completely different topic with heavy punctuation.
  
- **keywords**: key",1,"### response: 

 dorothy: i don't know rose, maybe marry poppins has an italian cousin.

### label: sarcastic

### cues:

1. **common knowledge**: the mention of ""marry poppins"" immediately sets up an expectation of a classic, well-known character. the fact that the speaker suggests marry poppins might have an italian cousin seems absurd, challenging our common understanding of the character.

2. **rhetorical devices**: the use",1,"### keywords:
- ""italian cousin""
- ""marry poppins""

### language style:
- the use of a specific (""italian cousin"") and well-known character (""marry poppins"") to suggest something unusual or funny.
- the speaker's uncertainty expressed with ""i don't know rose,"" adding a note of mock dilemma.

### special symbols:
- no special symbols used in the text.

a conversation between two characters named dorothy and blanche. dorothy has previously asked if she can borrow rose's golf club for an appointment early in the morning.

### cues extracted:

1. **topic**: the topic is personal interaction or banter between dorothy and blanche, likely situated in a light-hearted and familiar environment. the context of borrowing a golf club adds an element of surprise and humor as it may not be common to borrow golf clubs for a date.

2. **",1,"### label: sarcastic

### explanation:
keywords: ""venus fly trap"" (suggests an ironic or exaggerated response when she mentions ""with a man"").

cultural background: the scenario involves a humorous play on gender roles and expectations, which might vary based on cultural norms. 

context: the context showcases dorothy making a seemingly inappropriate or unconventional choice for a date (playing golf with a ""man"") which she then playfully implies is not the case through her final line.

emotional",1,"### response: 

dorothy's statement ""no blanche, with a venus fly trap"" suggests an ironic twist on her initial claim of playing golf with a man, making it clear she's referring to something else, a venus fly trap, hence it's a playful and ironic statement.

- **surface emotion:** dorothy's tone might be teasing or joking.
- **common knowledge:** it's not common knowledge that one would have a date with a garden",1,1

dorothy's response seems like she is giving a directive to rose, which could potentially be seen as sarcastic if her tone implies the opposite. the phrase ""go to the corner and open a stand"" could be interpreted as an ironic request in the context, suggesting that rose should leave the area, counters usual advice for someone setting something down.

keywords: ""no"", ""go to the corner"", ""open a stand""

common knowledge: in a typical conversation, ""go to the corner"" could be a suggestion to move or arrange something.

### cues:
- rhetorical device: the use of ""you mean at a funeral?"" seems like an attempt to probe or clarify, which dorothy might quip in response to a misunderstanding, depending on her actual intention.
- cultural background: the mention of ""funeral"" and ""pie eating contest"" introduces a contrast that is unlikely in a funeral setting, reflecting a cultural understanding of typical settings where a eulogy might be delivered",1,"### response: 

dorothy's use of the word ""nervous"" in a goofy tone when discussing an eulogy provides a comedic contrast, and the exaggerated language could be interpreted as sarcastic. the line ""at a pie eating contest"" adds to the absurdity. therefore, the punctuation and the absurdity of the situation, along with the sarcastic tone, suggest that dorothy is being sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### response:

dorothy's statement about a pie eating contest implies a context that is unconventional for an eulogy, contrasting expectations for a somber occasion. the normalcy of the situation, combined with her emphasis on the contrast (using ""at a pie eating contest"" instead of ""at a funeral""), provides a cue that might hint at sarcasm.

### common knowledge: 
- this phrase can be interpreted based on shared knowledge, implying the object dorothy prefers in common with rose is a cappucino maker. this might be assumed as sarcasm if it implies that they have no common interests except for making coffee.

### emotional contrasts: 
- no explicit emotional contrast in the provided dialogue.

### context: 
dorothy and rose are having a conversation, hinting at a shared secret or understanding that involves intimate details of their relationship or situation. the question ""what's under the sheets?"" suggests that the secret or shared knowledge pertains to something hidden or private.

### topic: 
intimate details or private",1,"### response: 

it seems like there are no clear cues for sarcasm in this dialogue. dorothy mentions the cappuccino maker, which is a straightforward and literal statement, rather than an ironic remark. sarcasm often implies the opposite of what's being said, and in context, the statement about the cappuccino maker seems to be taken at face value.

the moderator's response is filled with strong positive sentiment indicators, using superlatives ""really really"" to emphasize excitement. this is a clear attempt at sarcasm - pretending to express high enthusiasm when in reality it can be seen as mocking or ironic. the phrase ""looking forward to hear"" is an unusual and awkward construction, implying that the person speaking does not have such expectations but is forced to say those words. cultural background and punctuation in this context are neutral but could support sarcasm",1,0

cues:

1. punctuation: the use of exclamation marks at the end of the sentence and the capitalization of ""soviet scientists"" and ""rogue third-world nations"" are indicators of exaggeration typically used in sarcasm.
2. surface emotion: the sarcastic tone is indicated by chandler correcting and mocking the referred ""out of work"" status of the soviet scientist rasputin, using a formal and surreal setup.
3. emotional words",1,"### response: 

the input text contains several cues indicative of sarcasm:

1. **language style**: the text has a formal and somewhat alienating tone, which might be used as irony to highlight a character's personality, notably chandler's quiriness. also, the specific word choice often seen in more formal or high-brow contexts (""soviet scientists"", ""rogue third-world nations"", ""hi rasputin!"") might be slightly exaggerated in a sarcastic manner.

2. **r",1,"### label: sarcastic

### cues:
- **punctuation:** the dialogue tag ""hi rasputin!"" instead of naming a real person (""vladimir"") might be seen as a deliberate use of punctuation to enhance a humorous effect.
- **common knowledge:** mentioning ""soviet scientists"" using the proper past tense ""out of work"" contrasts with the expectation that ""rasputin"" should be recognized as tsar nicholas ii's 'near saint' close friend",1,1

from the given context and input, there are certain cues that help classify the response as sarcastic.

1. **rhetorical devices**: the use of a rhetorical question (""the british are coming?"") is a cue that could indicate sarcasm. rhetorical questions are often used in a sarcastic manner to emphasize a point or convey disbelief.

2. **topic**: the allusion to ""the british are coming"" refers to a historical event from the american revolution, which",1,"### response: 

chandler's response, ""the british are coming?"", is a rhetorical device that directly references a famous quote from the movie ""patton."" it is likely used in a sarcastic or humorous way, suggesting that a scenario whose severity or situation is unexpected is happening. given the context and topical references, sarcasm is a likely intent.

### cues extraction:

1. **rhetorical devices**: ""the british are coming?"" is a rhetorical question, which is often used",1,"### response:

the input text contains keywords like ""british"" and ""coming,"" and the punctuation used is a question. however, without more context, it's difficult to conclude whether this is sarcasm or not. typically, in a sentence form of sarcasm, you would expect a more complex contradiction or twist on the initial question, such as saying ""the sun is rising!"" in response to ""what's happening outside?""
