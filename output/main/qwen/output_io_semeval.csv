step 1: the surface sentiment of the input is negative. key phrases such as ""people who tell people with anxiety to 'just stop worrying about it'"" and ""#not #educateyourself"" suggest annoyance or dissatisfaction.

step 2: the user is using sarcasm and appears to be mocking those people who criticize others with anxiety by suggesting that such actions might be problematic (""#not #educateyourself""). this can be seen through the rhetorical",1

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is positive. the phrase ""most important thing"" and exclaimation mark indicate emphasis on something positive. the inclusion of a link further suggests a recommendation or excitement for the content.

step 2: the true intention appears to be critical or ironic, as presenting something as the 'most important thing' in a sarcastic context often implies the opposite is true. the language choice and context of presenting",1

### explanation:

step 1:
the surface sentiment seems neutral. there are no specific keywords or phrases that indicate strong positivity or negativity, and no emojis are present.

step 2:
upon closer inspection, it appears that the user is providing a choice between two types of fish - trout and northern pike. however, the line appears to be followed by a list of usernames suggesting a joke. the use of the ""@"" symbol before each username typically denotes mentions on social media platforms",1

### explanation:

**step 1**: the surface sentiment appears positive, with phrases like ""a blast"" and the use of an exclamation point following the mention of hanging out. the emoji (http://t.co/ikgz8u9fos) might suggest a celebratory or positive situation. 

**step 2**: upon closer examination, the url (partially visible, http://t.co/) might indicate a playful jab or a reference to something prickly",1

### response:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive, as indicated by the phrases ""#good #morning"", ""#instadaily"", ""#snapchat"", ""#selfie"". there are no direct emojis, but the use of hashtags in a social media context typically contributes to a positive vibe. 

step 2: upon deeper examination, one may notice sarcastic language and irony in the sentence. the user is tagging someone as if they are very active on",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems to indicate a negative emotion due to the context of spending the majority of the day in and out of the doctor. this could also be perceived as words like ""awesome"" being used in a sarcastic way, especially with the hashtag #sarcasm clearly signaling an ironic tone.

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive. the use of the keyword ""strong tweet"" and the encouragement (""particularly horatio's involvement in the matters"") with emojis denoting support and continuation indicate a cooperative and appreciative tone.

step 2: upon closer examination, the sentence structure and tone seem to be designed to contrast expectations, given that involving ""horatio"" in ""the matters"" could imply unwanted or awkward associations. this is reinforced by the",1

step 2: when reading the text carefully, it includes ironic hashtags like ""#onpoli #topoli #cdnpoli"", which are typically used to discuss political topics on twitter. however, the statement at the beginning ""access to housing is not a fundamental human right, according to",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text involves keywords like ""oh dear"" and ""some people"" which reflect a slightly concerned or disgusted sentiment. additionally, the emoji 😳 could suggest intrigue, possibly reflecting surprise from the annoyance or confusion of others not understanding irony. 

step 2: examining the usage of ""#irony"", together with the wording ""don't get"", determines the true intention of the sentence. this implies that ""getting""",1

the statement is about an nfl player who did a ""hands up, don't shoot"" pose being arrested. emoticons (@po_st) are used to link to a source. overall, the tone seems serious yet possibly critical given the reference to the 'hands up, don't shoot' pose, which has been associated with the ferguson protests in the us.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment here appears neutral, as the word ""packed"" simply describes the gym's state of being full of people.

step 2: considering the typical tone of using ""never seen the gym so packed"" in an everyday context describes a situation as unusually tightly crowded, the real intention could be to express surprise or shock at the high level of activity or simply use it in a straight way without sarcasm.

### explanation:

### step 1:

the surface sentiment of this text leans towards frustration or dread. phrases such as ""throwing up"", ""not"", ""#not"", ""hate this"", ""sick"", and ""wanna go to school"" all suggest a negative and uneasy state. this sentiment is further emphasized by the hashtag ""#sick"".

### step 2:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems relatively positive or neutral because ""i actually think he needs to use the youngsters in this reincarnation"" might indicate a supportive or constructive intent.

step 2: the context, the hashtag #irony, and the author's username @gazzadowns, suggest that there is likely a reversal of expectations or a hint that not everything is as it seems. this language style typically points to sarcasm.

### explanatory analysis:

step 1: from a surface perspective, the sentiment in the given text seems to be negative or sarcastic, as indicated by hashtags like #not, #ew, and #saywhat which usually denote a contradicted or sarcastic tone. it could also be interpreted that the person is saying they find sunday boring and not fun.

step 2: however, despite this initial interpretation, the use of #saywhat at the end indicates",1

### steps:

1. **surface sentiment analysis:** the surface sentiment of the text is negative or somewhat melancholic. keywords like ""still gonna get me santa's gifts"" and the hashtag ""#irony"" could indicate a hint of sarcasm or irony. the phrase ""but i really don't know what to ask for"" also carries a slightly ironic tone as it contrasts with the expectation set by the first part.

step 2: analyzing the sentence structure and language style, there do not appear to be any rhetorical devices, seemingly straightforward and non-ironic language is used.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (positive) and true intention (expressing genuine excitement for the next semester), there seems to be no discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm.

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems positive, indicated by the keyword ""amazing"" and the smiling emoji 😊.

step 2: the true intention is deduced by analyzing the sentence more carefully. the phrase ""officially surrounded myself with"" can imply that the speaker has already reached a certain level of contentment or satisfaction with their social circle, which is unlikely to be expressed in a sarcastic tone when accompanied by an explicit positive sentiment.

the presence of emojis such as the one resembling a closed mouth and raised eye (gif 'bitches be like'), mirthful emojis related to appointments, 'more please' for orthodontist appointments, these points to a cheerful tone. there is also the stark contrast between the strong request for more appointments and the seemingly mocking hashtag phrase 'not' followed by 'crazy'.

### reason:

step 1: surface sentiment
the keywords ""lol"" and ""needs a hoover"" suggest a casual, somewhat humorous tone. additionally, the emojis used further hint at a lighthearted or humorous message.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is given by the statement 'you can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable, or you think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%'. this seems neutral and informative in tone.

step 2: when examining carefully, the sentence structure suggests that the speaker is considering the two options themselves. the colon introduces two possibilities that are then followed by",1

### step-by-step reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment

the surface sentiment of the text is conveyed by the words ""sad moment"", ""realize you're past the point"", ""move back in"". these words suggest a sense of nostalgia or regret, indicating that the text is likely to carry a serious tone.

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be positive, with the user stating they recycled a few beer bottles and expressing enthusiasm with the recycling symbols and emojis. the use of the phrase ""a few"" could suggest a casual or playful tone.

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be concerned or apologetic, with the user indicating lance stephenson is unable to travel with the team due to his inability to run fully. this suggests a sense of responsibility and maybe even regret or无奈 about his situation.

step 2: upon contemplating the text carefully, it becomes apparent the user might be using sarcasm. the hashtag ""#not"" is followed by ""traveling #with #team,""",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment
upon examining the text, key words such as ""gotta love"", ""improvised version"", ""minor key"", and ""#not"" suggest a more positive feel. the use of hashtags such as ""#not"" are often used in internet jargon to negate something. individually, these elements may not carry sarcasm, but when combined, something might contradict the apparent sentiment.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is negative. the person is unfortunately stuck with their child for an extended period and perhaps unexpectedly, as indicated by ""gives me"" and ""#not!"".

step 2: the writer might be genuinely upset or annoyed about spending extra time with their son from 3 pm to 8 pm, especially if they had planned their day differently. this scenario appears more serious than the action it is paired with (""",1

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be ironic. the phrase 'chu*** samajhte hai' refers to someone assuming or believing something, with 'chu***' possibly used as a derogatory term. therefore, the use of this phrase seems to imply a misunderstanding or ignorance of a more complex idea.

step 2: upon closer inspection, it is clear that the user is using irony to point out the inconsistency of someone (pres",1

the surface sentiment of the text is one of religious devotion, enthusiasm, and perhaps emotional intensity, as indicated by words like 'bestiestest' (likely meant to exaggerate the level of affection), '*teary-eyed*' (an emoji suggesting emotional response), and phrases ""the king is coming!"" and ""my god's not dead, he's surely alive!"" which suggest a strong belief in god's existence and possibly resurrection. emojis include",1

### reasoning:

the sentence appears to be about someone expressing discomfort due to a lack of heat in their apartment, which is explicitly mentioned at the start with the phrase ""love waking up to no heat in my apartment"". the hashtags #not and #socold suggest that this is fact or the reality being communicated rather than a feeling of enjoyment.

step 1: surface sentiment - the surface sentiment of the text is generally negative or perhaps sarcastic. keywords like ""something-for-nothing culture"" and ""$"" hint at a mocking or ironic tone.

the surface sentiment appears neutral and seems like a complaint or suggestion about the ministry of health (moh) assuming everyone should wash hands with water. the use of hashtags such as #irony also indicates that this might be a comment meant to express sarcasm.

### reasoning:

step 1: the **surface sentiment** can be identified with keywords such as ""finished the year strong"", ""happy new year"", ""hoping for better"". these indications seem to convey a positive tone, suggesting a healthy activity (bike workout) and hopeful wishes for an improvement in 2015.

step 2: to truly understand the **true intention**, it's important to carefully check the language style used. reading between the lines",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment in this situation comes off as negative, as phrases like ""thrown at them"", ""those who do the crimes"" suggest a harsh and unjust tone.

step 2: when examining the true intention through careful scrutiny of the language usage, the sentence appears to be sarcastically using the rhetoric of irony and justice in a nonsensical, arguably justifiable, but humorous way. the hashtags #irony and #not",1

### explanation:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be quite serious with words like ""just use my boyfriend"". there's no indication of any kind of humor or irony here.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of this text is a bit of frustration or annoyance. the author feels that people are talking about snow as if it is an unusual or important event, whereas the author mentions that the only ""snow"" that matters to them, and is a real inconvenience, is accumulating on their cars. entertainment emojis could also hint to a light-hearted view of the situation, that might in fact be sarcastic.

step 2: by carefully checking the language style, we can see it is using sarcasm. the hashtag #not is also a strong indicator as it is typically used to negate comments. the sentence deliberately contradicts the negative sentiment with a seemingly positive hashtag, suggesting that the speaker does not actually enjoy going to bed alone.

step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be a mix of irony and emotion. the words ""kid who tried stealing tools"" and ""mad"" indicate an angry tone, while the hashtag ""#irony"" hints at a discrepancy between the literal understanding of the words and a more tacit meaning.

step 2: closer examination of the sentence reveals that it could be interpreted as a playful, sarcastic remark on situations typically perceived as ironic. the situation described appears over",1

### explanation:

step 1: on the surface, the sentiment appears to be slightly negative, as the person in question 'lost a fiver'. this term is colloquial slang, often used for money, implying a small amount here. compliments like 'thanks' or 'cheers' are somewhat forced to fit the sarcastic tone.

step 2: however, the sarcasm comes into play when we consider the context and the structure of the sentence.",1

step 1: the surface sentiment seems positive. phrases like ""so glad"" and the happy expression emoji (😉) indicate an optimistic emotion.

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is jovial and nostalgic, with the use of hashtags #goodtimes and the reminiscing about ""mud sliding down that hill"" at concerts, which suggests a sense of fondness for past events.

step 2: the phrase ""i seem to remember (sort of)"" further indicates that the author is not being entirely serious about the mud sliding down the hill. additionally, the context involving concert references could",1

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text appears to be a request or plea for something to happen, indicated by the words ""please"" and ""let us get out of dance early"".

step 2: upon closer examination, this sentence is actually suggesting that it is currently snowing, which often entails getting stuck indoors, and so the speaker is genuinely asking or wishing to be excused from the dance early out of necessity, not preference.

### explanation:

step 1: on the surface, the message seems to express confusion and disappointment over finding evidence of a stripper in the house but no actual stripper being present. the use of emojis such as '😊' and '💔' suggests confusion or frustration.

the word '@hollymanthei' seems to be directed at a person, which might imply a hint of sarcasm if taken in context. the phrase ""no one really says that"" could suggest that the previous mention or statement was unexpected or exaggerated for the purpose of comedy. however, without more context, it's hard to draw definitive conclusions.

step 1: the surface sentiment seems positive. the user expresses happiness about leaving behind malls and materialism in the us, which are often associated with negative connotations in the context of a superficial or consumerist culture. 

step 2: the true intention of the statement could be sarcasm if the user is actually not feeling happy about having to deal with malls and materialism in prague (prg), where they are currently located. the use of the hashtag ""#iron",1

### reasoning:

step 1: looking at the surface level, the primary keyword ""not"" might suggest a contradictory or exaggerated sentiment, which is often used in sarcasm.

step 2: the text seems to highlight and celebrate an ""ugly christmas sweater,"" which usually isn't the intended purpose. if the user genuinely loved the sweater, they wouldn’t describe it as ""ugly."" this indicates the true intention might be to mock or critique the sweater, suggesting",1

reasoning:
step 1: the surface sentiment of the text appears to be humble and possibly reflective. the user mentions not being perfect and choosing between #women #not #perfet, indicating they are aware of their ordinary status among women.

step 2: however, the context is significantly enhanced by the attribution to mary j. blige, a well-known and successful artist who shares her thoughts. her culture could imbue this with a catchphrase-play in her song",1

### step-by-step reasoning:

step 1: **surface sentiment**
   - the user mentions ""@coreybking thanks for the spoiler"" using a hashtag ""#not"", which intuitively suggests they are not thankful for the spoiler. this phrase employs irony, as usually people appreciate thanks, and they are thankful positively. the presence of ""#not"" also casts a direct opposite shade to the sentiment, reinforcing a potential sarcasm.

step 2: **true intention",1

step 2: by carefully checking the sentence structure and style, it appears as though the speaker might be mocking or criticizing a situation where congress has made a move they presumably do not like. mention",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems negative, with words like ""highly inflamed stomach"" and the addition of ""#not"" at the end which is often used to indicate ironic negation.

step 2: considering the sentence structure and the context, it appears the speaker is saying they likes dealing with a highly inflamed stomach, which is likely contrary to the usual perception of stomach inflammation as being painful or uncomfortable. using a hashtag afterwards",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment of the text seems cheerful and enthusiastic, as indicated by the keywords ""munching cheese"" and ""#stiltonoverload"". this suggests a tone of excitement and joy.

step 2: however, the context of the phrase ""#stiltonoverload"" reveals additional information. stilton is a type of blue cheese, typically consumed around christmas time (as indicated by ""#christmas""). while the text appears to indicate excitement",1

### explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be negative, which is indicated by the phrase ""trying to kill their opponents"". the tone is serious, signaling potentially aggressive intentions.

step 2: however, the context provided by hashtag #mcfc (manchester city football club - known for their competitive spirit and efforts often mentioned in a positive light), introduces a layer of ambiguity. the saying ""trying to kill their opponents"" is usually a figurative or exaggerated way",1

### explanation:
step 1: the surface sentiment here seems to be ironic. the inclusion of the hashtag #irony following the phrase ""dog in the manger"" indicates that there is a twist or a joke in the statement which implies sarcasm.

step 2: after careful examination, it is deduced that the true intention is likely to be sarcastic. the phrase ""no 'dog in the manger'"" implies that someone intentionally left the dog out, as",1
