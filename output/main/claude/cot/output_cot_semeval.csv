1. context: the tweet appears to be addressing someone (@callisto1947) and mentioning tsu (likely the social uplift, a social media platform).

2. content analysis:
   - ""more conservatives needed on #tsu"": this suggests a call for political engagement on a platform.
   - ""get paid 4 posting stuff like this"": this implies that people can earn money for posting content.

3. tone and style:
   - the message is direct and promotional.
   - there's no obvious irony or contradiction in the statement.
   - the use of shorthand (like ""u"" for ""you"" and ""4"" for ""for"") is common in tweets and doesn't indicate sarcasm.

"Just walked in to #Starbucks and asked for a ""tall blonde"" Hahahaha #irony",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. context: the text mentions walking into starbucks and ordering a drink.

2. language used:
   - ""tall blonde"" is in quotes, suggesting a double meaning.
   - ""hahahaha"" indicates laughter or amusement.
   - the hashtag #irony is used at the end.

3. double meaning analysis:
   - in starbucks terminology, ""tall"" refers to a size, and ""blonde"" refers to a type of roast.
   - outside of starbucks, ""tall blonde"" could describe a person's physical appearance.

4. the author's reaction:
   - the ""hahahaha"" suggests they find humor in the situation.
   - they specifically point out the irony with the #irony hashtag.

5. interpretation:
   - the author is amused by the fact that ordering a coffee sounds like they're describing a person.
   - they're deliberately drawing attention to this humorous double meaning.

6. use of #irony:
   - while the situation is more of a play on words than true irony, the author perceives it as ironic or is using the term loosely.

7. sarcasm assessment:
   - the text doesn't show contempt or mock criticism typical of sarcasm.
   - instead, it highlights a humorous observation about language.

conclusion: while the text is humorous and plays with language, it doesn't fit the traditional definition of sarcasm. the author seems genuinely amused rather than using sarcasm to convey criticism or contempt.

#NOT GONNA WIN http://t.co/Mc9ebqjAqj,0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. context analysis:
   - the text is very short and appears to be a social media post, likely from twitter due to the ""http://t.co"" link format.
   - it's a statement followed by a link, which could be leading to an image, article, or video.

2. phrase examination:
   - ""not gonna win"" is written in all caps, which often indicates emphasis or strong emotion.
   - this phrase is typically used to express a negative prediction or pessimistic outlook.

3. tone consideration:
   - the use of all caps could suggest frustration, anger, or intense disagreement with something.
   - however, without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is genuine frustration or exaggerated for effect.

4. potential sarcasm indicators:
   - sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means.
   - in this case, if the linked content shows something that is clearly winning or successful, the statement ""not gonna win"" could be sarcastic.
   - however, without seeing the linked content, we can't confirm this.

5. lack of clear sarcasm markers:
   - there are no obvious linguistic cues for sarcasm such as ""oh, sure,"" ""yeah, right,"" or other common sarcastic phrases.
   - the statement is direct and doesn't have the typical ironic or mocking tone often associated with sarcasm.

6. final consideration:
   - given the limited information and the absence of clear sarcastic indicators, it's more likely that this statement is meant to be taken at face value.
   - the emphatic nature suggests genuine belief in the statement rather than irony.

conclusion:
based on this analysis, while there's a small possibility of sarcasm depending on the unseen linked content, the more probable interpretation is that this statement is not sarcastic.

2. tone: the tone seems direct and critical, not particularly playful or ironic.

3. language:
   - ""he is exactly that sort of person"" - this is a straightforward statement, implying agreement with a previous characterization.
   - ""weirdo!"" - this is a direct, negative label applied to the person being discussed.

4. sarcasm indicators:
   - there are no obvious contradictions or exaggerations that might indicate sarcasm.
   - the exclamation point in ""weirdo!"" emphasizes the speaker's sentiment but doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.
   - the statement is brief and to the point, which is less common in sarcastic comments that often involve more elaborate setups.

5. overall impression: the comment appears to be a genuine expression of disapproval or criticism towards the person being discussed. there are no clear markers of sarcasm or irony.

So much #sarcasm at work mate 10/10 #boring 100% #dead mate full on #shit absolutely #sleeping mate can't handle the #sarcasm,1,"let's think through this step by step:

1. initial impression: the text is filled with hashtags and exaggerated statements, which are often indicators of sarcasm.

2. hashtag analysis:
   - #sarcasm appears twice, explicitly stating the intention of sarcasm
   - #boring, #dead, #shit, #sleeping are negative descriptors
   - these negative hashtags contrast with the seemingly positive ""10/10"" rating

3. language and tone:
   - the use of ""mate"" multiple times gives a casual, conversational tone
   - the phrases ""full on"" and ""can't handle"" intensify the sentiment

4. contradiction:
   - saying ""so much #sarcasm at work"" followed by positive ratings (""10/10"") creates a contradiction
   - this contradiction is a classic sarcastic technique

5. overstatement:
   - the text uses extreme language like ""100% #dead"" and ""absolutely #sleeping""
   - such hyperbole is often used in sarcastic expressions

6. context:
   - the text appears to be describing a work situation, likely expressing dissatisfaction through sarcasm

7. explicit sarcasm markers:
   - the repeated use of #sarcasm is a direct indicator that the speaker is being sarcastic

conclusion: based on the explicit use of #sarcasm, the contradictory statements, exaggerated language, and overall tone, this text is clearly intended to be sarcastic.

Corny jokes are my absolute favorite,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context:
   - the statement is about corny jokes, which are typically considered cheesy or unfunny by most people.

2. language:
   - the phrase ""absolute favorite"" is an emphatic expression of strong preference.

3. typical reactions to corny jokes:
   - most people don't genuinely love corny jokes; they often groan or roll their eyes at them.

4. potential for irony:
   - saying corny jokes are one's ""absolute favorite"" could be seen as contradictory to common opinion.

5. tone consideration:
   - without additional context (like tone of voice or facial expressions), it's challenging to determine if this is sincere or sarcastic.

6. probability of sarcasm:
   - given that corny jokes are generally not highly regarded, there's a higher likelihood that this statement is sarcastic rather than sincere.

7. final interpretation:
   - the statement is likely meant to be humorous by sarcastically claiming to love something generally considered annoying or unfunny.

### label: sarcastic

the chain of thought leads to the conclusion that this statement is most likely sarcastic, as it's more probable that someone would sarcastically claim to love corny jokes than genuinely consider them their absolute favorite.",1
"People complain about my backround pic and all I feel is like ""hey don't blame me, Albert E might have spoken those words"" #sarcasm #life",1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. content analysis:
   - the text mentions people complaining about the author's background picture.
   - the author's response is presented in quotes, suggesting it's not their actual thought but a hypothetical one.
   - the response attributes a quote to albert einstein (referred to as ""albert e"").

2. tone and context:
   - the overall tone is defensive and dismissive of the complaints.
   - the author is implying that they're not responsible for the content of their background picture.
   - the attribution to einstein is likely not genuine, as it's presented casually and without certainty.

3. hashtags:
   - the text includes ""#sarcasm"" explicitly, which is a clear indicator of the author's intent.
   - the ""#life"" hashtag doesn't contribute to determining sarcasm but suggests a casual, observational tone.

4. sarcastic elements:
   - the casual attribution of a quote to einstein without verification is likely meant to be humorous.
   - the defensive stance of ""don't blame me"" for something the author clearly chose (their background picture) is contradictory and likely meant to be ironic.

5. overall interpretation:
   - the author is using sarcasm to deflect criticism about their background picture.
   - they're jokingly suggesting that einstein might have said whatever is in the picture, which is clearly not meant to be taken seriously.

conclusion:

### label: not sarcastic

"if Christian expects Fifa to sleep in my bed with me tonight, he's wrong 👿",0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the statement mentions christian, fifa, and sleeping arrangements.

2. tone: the use of the devil emoji (👿) at the end suggests frustration or disagreement.

3. content analysis:
   - fifa is not a person, but an international football organization.
   - it's absurd to suggest that an organization could sleep in someone's bed.
   - the statement implies that christian has an unrealistic expectation.

4. implication: the speaker is using fifa as a stand-in for something else, likely a pet or object that christian wants in the bed.

5. linguistic device: the statement uses absurdity (personifying fifa) to make a point about christian's expectations.

6. intent: the speaker is not literally talking about fifa sleeping in the bed, but using this absurd idea to express disagreement with christian's actual expectation.

   - absurd scenario (fifa sleeping in a bed)
   - exaggeration for effect
   - implied criticism of christian's expectation

conclusion: given the absurd scenario presented, the exaggeration, and the implied criticism, this statement is clearly using sarcasm to make a point.

1. context: the text is commenting on people who give simplistic advice to those with anxiety.

2. content:
   - the phrase ""just stop worrying about it"" is presented as advice given to people with anxiety.
   - this advice is overly simplistic and shows a lack of understanding about anxiety disorders.

3. tone:

   - ""#educateyourself"" implies that the people giving this advice need to learn more about anxiety.

5. sarcasm indicators:

   - the hashtags reinforce the sarcastic intent by explicitly contradicting and criticizing the statement.

6. overall message:

Most important thing I've learned in school http://t.co/TvfJMGBlBh,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, we need to consider the context. this appears to be a tweet, given the ""http://t.co"" link at the end.

2. the text itself is incomplete. it's stating ""most important thing i've learned in school"" followed by a link. this suggests that the actual content or punchline is in the linked image or webpage.

3. without seeing the linked content, it's difficult to determine if this is sarcastic or not. however, the setup of the tweet suggests there might be something unexpected or humorous to follow.

4. the phrase ""most important thing i've learned in school"" is often used in a hyperbolic or ironic way, especially on social media, to introduce something trivial or humorous rather than genuinely important academic knowledge.

5. given the format and the common use of such phrases on social media platforms, there's a good chance this is setting up for a sarcastic or humorous reveal in the linked content.

6. however, without seeing the linked content, we can't be absolutely certain. the linked content could genuinely be something important learned in school.

7. despite this uncertainty, based on the typical patterns of social media humor and the way the tweet is structured, it's more likely to be sarcastic than not.

### label: sarcastic

while we can't be 100% certain without seeing the linked content, the structure and context of the tweet strongly suggest it's likely to be sarcastic. the setup implies that the ""most important thing"" learned in school is probably not what one would typically expect, which is a common format for sarcastic humor.",1

1. initial impression: the text appears to be sarcastic due to its exaggerated tone and use of hashtags.

2. language analysis:
   - the phrase ""i love"" is often used sarcastically to express the opposite.
   - the excessive exclamation marks (!!!!!!) suggest an over-the-top enthusiasm, which is often a sign of sarcasm.
   - ""der"" is likely a misspelling of ""they're,"" which could be intentional to mock enthusiasm.
   - the use of ""most favourite"" is grammatically incorrect, which could be intentional for sarcastic effect.

3. context clues:
   - ""context and large ensemble fridays"" doesn't seem like a common or particularly enjoyable thing, making it likely to be sarcastic.

4. explicit indicators:
   - the hashtag #sarcasm is a direct indicator that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.
   - the hashtag #getthefuckout further reinforces the sarcastic tone, expressing frustration or dismissal.

5. overall tone:
   the combination of exaggerated language, intentional errors, and explicit sarcasm indicators strongly suggests that the statement is not meant to be taken literally.

2. tone: the opening ""oh boy..."" could be interpreted in multiple ways. it might express excitement, but it could also be sarcastic depending on the context.

5. lack of sarcastic indicators: there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, obvious irony, or contradictory statements.

1. context: the tweet seems to be part of a conversation or debate about crime statistics in chicago.

2. tone: the opening word ""liar"" in all caps suggests a strong, confrontational tone.

3. content: the author is asserting that they have never denied a specific statistic (532 murders in chicago in 2012).

4. contradiction: there's an implied contradiction between being called a liar and claiming to have never denied a fact.

5. exaggeration: the use of ""liar"" for potentially disagreeing about or discussing crime statistics seems disproportionate.

6. intention: the author appears to be pushing back against an accusation, but doing so in a way that seems overly dramatic or exaggerated.

7. subtext: the implication is that the author is being falsely accused of denying facts, and they're responding with deliberate overemphasis.

8. social media context: the multiple @mentions suggest this is part of a larger twitter conversation, where sarcasm is often employed.

given these observations, particularly the exaggerated tone, the implied contradiction, and the dramatic pushback against an apparent accusation, this tweet appears to be using sarcasm to make a point.

   - the tweet is discussing the concept of irony in relation to cryptocurrency (bitcoin) and generational gaps.

2. key elements:

   - describes an unlikely scenario: a 77-year-old rapper going viral

6. the use of a hashtag explicitly labeling the statement as sarcasm is a clear indicator that the speaker intends this to be understood as sarcastic.

7. the explicit labeling removes any ambiguity about the speaker's intent.

3. rhetorical questions: both sentences are rhetorical questions, which are commonly used in sarcastic statements to emphasize a point.

4. exaggeration: the idea that hipsters might need to be ""told"" about irony, or that they would rely on history books from used bookstores for this information, is an exaggeration used for comedic effect.

5. hashtags: the use of hashtags like #hipsters and #brooklyn seems to be done in a mocking way, further supporting the sarcastic tone.

6. implied criticism: the tweet implies criticism of hipsters' understanding of irony and their supposed ignorance of recent history, which is delivered through sarcasm rather than direct statement.

7. contradiction: the tweet sarcastically suggests that irony was only a ""thing"" during the clinton years, which contradicts the fact that irony has been a longstanding concept in language and culture.

given these observations, particularly the mocking tone, use of rhetorical questions, and implied criticism delivered through exaggeration, we can conclude that this tweet is indeed sarcastic.

"@LaurenBailes I think the general rule is, if it's open all night, pull an all-nighter.",0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the tweet is responding to someone named @laurenbailes and seems to be giving advice.

2. content: the advice given is about pulling an all-nighter if a place is open all night.

3. tone: the tone appears to be casual and somewhat humorous.

4. logic: the ""general rule"" proposed doesn't make much sense as a genuine piece of advice. staying up all night just because a place is open 24 hours is not typically considered wise or healthy behavior.

5. implied meaning: the suggestion to pull an all-nighter for such a trivial reason is likely meant to be taken as a joke rather than serious advice.

6. cultural context: all-nighters are often associated with college students or young people, and there's often humor around the questionable decision-making that leads to them.

7. sarcasm indicators: while not overtly sarcastic, the statement presents an absurd ""rule"" in a matter-of-fact way, which is a common sarcastic technique.

conclusion: given the absurdity of the ""rule"" presented as general advice, and the casual, humorous tone, this statement is likely meant to be taken sarcastically rather than as genuine advice.

3. hashtags:

4. contradiction:
   the exclamation marks and capitalization contrast with the negative sentiment, creating a mismatch between the apparent excitement and the actual frustration.

   the tweet is expressing irritation about a song being played again, but does so in an exaggerated, dramatic way that doesn't match genuine enthusiasm.

6. intent:
   the writer is likely trying to convey their annoyance in a humorous, exaggerated manner, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

   - the author is deliberately pointing out the contradictory nature of hipster culture becoming popular.

6. sarcasm indicators:

@BunnyDhillon17 exactly and we are fighting like animals,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: this appears to be a response to another user (@bunnydhillon17) on a social media platform.

2. language: the phrase ""exactly"" suggests agreement with a previous statement.

3. content: the statement ""we are fighting like animals"" is the key part to analyze.

4. literal meaning: if taken literally, this would mean people are actually physically fighting in a bestial manner.

5. figurative meaning: in most contexts, this phrase is used metaphorically to describe intense disagreement or conflict, not literal animal-like fighting.

6. tone: the combination of ""exactly"" (agreement) with a negative observation creates a contrast that often indicates sarcasm.

7. intent: the speaker seems to be highlighting the absurdity or irony of a situation where people who should be united are instead in conflict.

8. sarcasm indicators: 
   - exaggeration (""like animals"")
   - contrast between agreement and negative observation
   - implied criticism of human behavior

9. conclusion: given the exaggeration and the implied criticism of human behavior by comparing it to animals, this statement is most likely meant to be sarcastic.

http://t.co/PfJ92w4CwZ #TeenAnalCasting #Top Top 50 Christian Songs For 2012,0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. content analysis:
   - the text contains a url and two hashtags.
   - the first hashtag ""#teenanalcasting"" is highly inappropriate and shocking, especially in the context of what follows.
   - the second part mentions ""top 50 christian songs for 2012"".

2. contextual incongruity:
   - there's a stark contrast between the first hashtag, which suggests pornographic content, and the reference to christian songs.
   - this juxtaposition is deliberately jarring and offensive.

3. intent consideration:
   - the combination of these vastly different and conflicting themes is likely intentional.
   - it appears to be crafted to shock, offend, or mock religious sensibilities.

4. sarcasm indicators:
   - the extreme mismatch between the hashtags and the content about christian songs is a classic sarcastic technique.
   - it's using shock value and inappropriate content to make a point or joke at the expense of religious music.

5. overall tone:
   - the tone is provocative and mocking, not sincere or informative.

conclusion:
given the deliberate juxtaposition of extremely inappropriate content with religious music, the shocking nature of the contrast, and the likely intent to provoke or mock, this text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm.

given these points, especially the contrast between expectation and reality, the mocking tone, and the implied humor at someone else's expense, this tweet appears to be using sarcasm.

2. tone: the overall tone seems frustrated and negative.

3. language use:
   - ""perfect way to start"" - this phrase is typically used sarcastically when describing a bad start to a day.
   - the hashtags #not, #annoyed, and #pissed further emphasize the negative emotions.

4. contradiction: saying it's a ""perfect way"" to start the day while clearly being upset about the situation is a classic sarcastic technique.

5. the hashtag ""#not"" is a common indicator of sarcasm, used to negate the seemingly positive statement that came before it.

3. language use:

   - expectation: virgin media said the fault would be fixed by 4pm.
   - reality: a technician arrived at 4pm to start fixing the fault.

3. tone: the tweet starts with ""love the way,"" which in this context doesn't seem genuinely positive.

2. the message seems to be promoting a positive, altruistic view of music creation.

3. key phrases to consider:
   - ""for the people and not for the money""
   - ""peace and love""
   - ""#kinglife""

4. on the surface, these phrases appear sincere and aligned with idealistic views often expressed by artists.

5. however, we need to consider if there might be any contradictions or hints of sarcasm:
   - the hashtag ""#kinglife"" could potentially be seen as boastful, which might contradict the humble message.
   - the link included might lead to content that contradicts the stated message, but we can't verify this.

6. the overall tone doesn't have typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, obvious contradictions, or mocking language.

7. without more context about the author or the linked content, it's difficult to detect any clear sarcastic intent.

8. the message aligns with common sentiments expressed genuinely by musicians and artists.

given these considerations, while there's a small possibility of sarcasm, there isn't enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic.

1. context: the statement is about ""holiday rituals for true africans.""

7. intent: the author is using this sarcastic structure to emphasize their frustration or displeasure with the long wait at the er.

conclusion: based on the contradictory use of ""#yay"" in a negative context, followed by ""#not"" to negate it, this text is clearly using sarcasm to express frustration.

Painting all cops with a broad brush because of the actions of a few is the same logic racists use. #Irony,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the tweet is commenting on generalizing all police officers based on the actions of a few.

2. content analysis:
   - the tweet draws a parallel between judging all cops based on some bad actors and the logic used by racists.
   - this comparison is intended to highlight the flawed reasoning in both cases.

3. language use:
   - the tone is matter-of-fact rather than overtly sarcastic.
   - however, the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the author is aware of some ironic element.

4. implied meaning:
   - the author is likely pointing out that those who criticize all police officers are using the same flawed logic they often accuse racists of using.
   - this creates a situational irony, where the critics are inadvertently mimicking the behavior they condemn.

5. use of hashtag:
   - the ""#irony"" hashtag is crucial here. it explicitly signals that the author is aware of and pointing out the ironic nature of the situation.

6. sarcasm vs. irony:
   - while the tweet points out irony, it doesn't necessarily use sarcasm to do so.
   - sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what is meant, often with a mocking tone.
   - this tweet is more straightforward in its criticism, using irony as a tool rather than sarcasm.

conclusion: although the tweet points out irony, it doesn't employ sarcasm in its delivery. the statement is meant to be taken at face value to highlight the ironic parallel, rather than saying one thing and meaning another (which would be sarcastic).

Don't know if I can handle this crazy 11-2 shift. It's so long I might pass out on the job! #sarcasm,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. content analysis:
   - the text describes a work shift from 11 to 2, which is actually only 3 hours long.
   - the author claims this shift is ""crazy"" and ""so long.""
   - they suggest they might ""pass out on the job"" due to its length.

2. contextual inconsistency:
   - a 3-hour shift is generally considered short, not long or crazy.
   - it's unlikely someone would pass out from exhaustion during such a short shift.

3. tone:
   - the exaggerated language (""crazy,"" ""might pass out"") doesn't match the reality of a short shift.
   - this mismatch between the language and the situation is a common indicator of sarcasm.

4. explicit indicator:
   - the text ends with ""#sarcasm,"" which is a clear signal that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

5. intent:
   - the author seems to be making fun of people who complain about short work shifts or easy workdays.

   - on its own, this could be interpreted as sincere or sarcastic.
   - the use of ""love"" with a negative experience (being ignored) suggests sarcasm.
   - the smiling emoji (😊) after a negative statement often indicates sarcasm.

   - the use of emojis to convey conflicting emotions (😊 vs 😒) adds to the sarcastic tone.

4. social media conventions:
   - the use of hashtags and emojis is typical in social media posts.
   - ""#not"" is a well-known way to indicate sarcasm in online communication.

5. overall message:
   - the speaker is clearly expressing frustration about being ignored, not genuine love for the experience.

   - the text appears to be a tweet or social media post.
   - it contains a hashtag ""#not"" which is often used to indicate sarcasm.
   - there are two urls included, which might lead to images or additional information.

2. context consideration:
   - the phrase ""produce mobile apps"" is straightforward and doesn't seem inherently sarcastic.
   - however, the ""#not"" immediately following it changes the interpretation.

3. understanding ""#not"":
   - in internet slang, adding ""#not"" at the end of a statement is a common way to indicate that the preceding statement should be interpreted as sarcastic or untrue.

4. lack of other sarcastic indicators:
   - besides the ""#not"", there are no other obvious sarcastic cues in the text.
   - the rest of the content seems to be just links, which don't provide additional context for sarcasm.

1. context: the tweet is responding to news about dale scott, a major league baseball umpire, coming out as gay.

2. reference: the tweet mentions michael sam and jason collins, who were both professional athletes who came out as gay and received significant media attention.

3. comparison: the tweet states that dale scott's coming out is ""about as relevant as michael sam and jason collins.""

4. tone: the use of ""about as relevant as"" suggests a dismissive or belittling attitude towards the news.

1. context: the statement is about answering a question correctly on a game show.

2. game show specifics:
   - it mentions ""final jeopardy,"" which is the last round of the popular quiz show jeopardy!
   - it specifically refers to ""kids jeopardy,"" a version of the show for children.

3. effect on the speaker:
   - the speaker claims it ""boosts my self-esteem.""

4. implications:
   - the speaker is likely an adult, as they're comparing themselves to children.
   - getting a question right on a kids' version of a game show shouldn't typically be a significant achievement for an adult.

5. humor and irony:
   - there's an implied self-deprecating humor in an adult feeling accomplished for knowing answers meant for children.
   - the statement pokes fun at the speaker's own intelligence or knowledge level.

6. tone:
   - the tone is not straightforward or serious; it's playful and self-mocking.

7. sarcasm indicators:
   - the incongruity between being an adult and feeling accomplished about a children's game show.
   - the exaggeration of the effect on self-esteem for such a minor ""achievement.""

conclusion:
given the self-deprecating humor, the incongruity between the subject (an adult) and the source of pride (kids' game show), and the exaggerated effect on self-esteem, this statement is clearly meant to be humorous and not taken at face value.

"If we win against Poland and Scotland, does that put us 65th in the world rankings. @YouBoysInGreen @FAIreland #Sarcasm",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

4. the crucial element:
   - the tweet ends with ""#sarcasm"".
   - this hashtag is a clear indicator that the author intends the tweet to be read as sarcastic.

5. understanding the sarcasm:
   - the author is likely criticizing the ranking system or their team's performance.
   - they're suggesting that even significant wins wouldn't improve their ranking much, which is absurd and therefore sarcastic.

6. the explicit label:
   - the use of ""#sarcasm"" removes any doubt about the author's intention.

7. genuine inquiry: the question appears to be seeking a genuine explanation or opinion on nato's post-cold war expansion.

You are taking your responsibilities so seriously today that i... More for Leo http://t.co/HJ6TebH4o6,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the structure and content of the text:
   - it starts with ""you are taking your responsibilities so seriously today that i...""
   - this is followed by ""more for leo"" and a url

2. consider the first part of the sentence:
   - ""you are taking your responsibilities so seriously today"" sounds like a compliment on the surface.

3. however, the sentence is cut off with ""that i..."" which suggests there's more to it.
   - this abrupt ending creates suspense and implies there might be an unexpected twist.

4. the inclusion of ""more for leo"" and a url suggests this is likely a horoscope or astrological prediction.

5. horoscopes often use vague, positive-sounding language that can be interpreted in multiple ways.

WATCH: #Megatron from #Transformers Rant About Social Media http://t.co/M9F1MWufXH #Irony,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the content of the tweet:
   - it's promoting a video link
   - it mentions ""#megatron from #transformers""
   - it says megatron is ranting about social media
   - it includes the hashtag ""#irony""

2. consider the context:
   - megatron is a fictional character, a giant robot from the transformers franchise
   - robots, especially fictional ones, don't typically use or have opinions on social media

3. look at the use of hashtags:
   - the use of ""#irony"" is particularly telling
   - irony often overlaps with sarcasm

4. think about the incongruity:
   - the idea of a fictional robot character ranting about a very human, modern concept (social media) is inherently absurd
   - this absurdity is likely intentional for humorous effect

5. consider the overall tone:
   - the tweet seems to be presenting something ridiculous as if it were serious news (indicated by ""watch:"")
   - this is a common sarcastic technique

6. conclusion:
   - the combination of the absurd scenario, the use of ""#irony"", and the presentation style strongly suggest this is not meant to be taken literally
   - the tweet is using sarcasm to comment on or make light of social media culture

given this analysis, the most appropriate classification is:

   - ""psn start working again?"": another rhetorical question, implying the service has been down for some time.

5. sarcasm indicators:
   - the use of rhetorical questions instead of direct statements.
   - the phrase ""in good faith"" emphasizes the perceived unfairness of the situation.

   - this ties back to the opening statement, creating a circular logic.

5. the overall tone seems playful and self-aware.
   - the speaker appears to be amused by the situation they've created.

6. there's an element of irony in claiming to unintentionally do something that achieves a stated goal.

considering these points, the statement appears to be using gentle sarcasm. the speaker is likely aware that their actions will cause confusion, and they're presenting it in a humorous, slightly self-deprecating way. the claim of unintentionality contrasts with the stated enjoyment of making people wonder, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

2. tone: the use of ""embarrassing"" and the hashtag ""#wtf"" (what the f***) indicate strong negative emotions.

3. exaggeration: the phrase ""one of the most embarrassing losses ever"" is an extreme statement. in sports, losses happen frequently, and calling one ""the most embarrassing ever"" is likely an overstatement.

4. hashtag: ""#wtf"" is often used to express genuine frustration or disbelief, but it can also be used sarcastically to emphasize a point.

5. social media context: this appears to be a tweet or similar social media post. sports fans often use hyperbole and dramatic language when discussing their team's performance.

7. emotional investment: sports fans often express genuine disappointment and frustration after losses, especially if they perceive the loss as particularly bad.

3. jay cutler reference: jay cutler is a former nfl quarterback known for attracting criticism and being a scapegoat for team issues.

6. intention: the comment seems designed to mock the tendency to blame cutler for everything, rather than seriously attributing fault to him.

7. absurdity: without more context, blaming cutler (who is retired) for a current issue is likely meant to be humorous or absurd.

given these points, particularly the use of a common sarcastic trope and the absurdity of blaming a retired player for a current issue, this comment appears to be intentionally exaggerated for humorous effect.

Testing water temperatures #excitingtimes #Not,1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. context: the text appears to be a social media post or comment about testing water temperatures.

2. language use:
   - the main text is straightforward and factual: ""testing water temperatures""
   - however, it's followed by two hashtags: ""#excitingtimes"" and ""#not""

3. hashtag analysis:
   - ""#excitingtimes"" suggests that testing water temperatures is an exciting activity
   - ""#not"" immediately contradicts the previous hashtag

4. tone interpretation:
   - the juxtaposition of ""exciting times"" with a mundane activity like testing water temperatures creates irony
   - the addition of ""#not"" confirms that the author doesn't actually find this exciting

5. sarcasm indicators:
   - the use of exaggeration (""exciting times"" for a boring task)
   - the immediate self-contradiction (""#not"")
   - the implied eye-roll or dismissive attitude towards the task

6. overall intent:
   the author is using sarcasm to express that testing water temperatures is, in fact, not exciting at all, but rather a boring or tedious task.

Leaving whilst its dark is fun. #not,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's look at the statement: ""leaving whilst its dark is fun.""
   - on its own, this could be a genuine statement. some people might enjoy leaving early in the morning or late at night.

2. however, we need to consider the hashtag at the end: ""#not""
   - the use of ""#not"" is a common way to indicate sarcasm or irony on social media.
   - it's used to contradict the statement that comes before it.

3. so, when we combine the statement with the hashtag, we get:
   - the person is saying leaving in the dark is fun, but then immediately contradicting it with ""#not""

4. this contradiction is a clear indicator of sarcasm:
   - the speaker is actually implying that leaving while it's dark is not fun, but they're saying it in a sarcastic way.

5. the use of sarcasm here is to emphasize how unpleasant or inconvenient it is to leave when it's dark outside.

given this analysis, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses the ""#not"" tag to clearly indicate that the speaker means the opposite of what they're literally saying, which is a textbook example of sarcasm.",1

1. tone and language:
   the tweet uses exaggerated and negative language, which is often a sign of sarcasm.

2. hashtags:
   - the use of ""#not!!"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it's used to negate the seemingly positive statement that came before it.

1. context: the tweet is referencing a news story about kate (likely kate middleton, a member of the british royal family) spending £32,000 on a meal.

2. language: the tweet uses quotation marks around phrases like 'republican move' and 'effectively rob the royals', suggesting these are not the author's own words but likely quoted from somewhere else.

3. contradiction: the tweet points out a contradiction between the idea of the royals being ""robbed"" and kate spending an extravagant amount on a single meal.

4. hashtag: the use of #irony is a clear indicator that the author intends this tweet to be understood as ironic or sarcastic.

2. language: the tone and phrasing seem exaggerated and unlikely for a real political announcement.

   - #pakistan is used normally.

4. political references:
   - @democratwire and @gop (republican party) being mentioned as supporting the same initiative is unusual and likely meant to be ironic.

5. word choice: 
   - ""special urgent package"" sounds overly dramatic.
   - ""enhance their fight against obscurantists"" is an unusual and grandiose way to phrase anti-terrorism efforts.

6. overall tone: the tweet seems to be mocking the idea of u.s. aid to pakistan, suggesting it's ineffective or misguided.

7. final consideration: the use of #not at the end is the clearest indicator that this is not meant to be taken at face value.

"how is it possible that somebody so interesting is also so, so, so boring? #irony #what",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the content of the text:
   - the statement presents a paradox: someone being both ""interesting"" and ""boring.""
   - the words ""so, so, so"" emphasize the degree of boringness.

2. look for linguistic cues:

   - the hashtags at the end provide additional context.
   - ""#irony"" directly indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken literally.
   - ""#what"" further emphasizes confusion or disbelief, supporting the sarcastic tone.

4. evaluate the overall intent:
   - the statement appears to mock or criticize someone by pointing out a contradictory nature.
   - it's unlikely that the speaker genuinely believes someone can be both very interesting and very boring simultaneously.

2. tone: the tone is negative and frustrated, indicated by the hashtag ""#fuckthat"" at the end.

3. first part: ""not going this time, we might have a chance!""
   - this suggests that the speaker's presence might be considered bad luck or detrimental to success.
   - the exclamation mark adds emphasis, possibly indicating exaggeration.

4. second part: ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice.....""
   - this is a reference to a common saying about not falling for the same trick twice.
   - the ellipsis at the end implies the speaker doesn't need to complete the phrase, as it's well-known.

5. implied meaning: the speaker is suggesting that by not attending, the chances of success are better, which is contrary to what one would normally expect.

6. use of sarcasm: the speaker is using sarcasm to express frustration or disappointment, likely from past experiences where attending led to disappointment.

7. overall message: the speaker is sarcastically implying that their absence will lead to a better outcome, which is not a sincere belief but rather a way to express frustration.

".@ibnlive is the first to cut to ads during primetime to proudly announce that they're ""putting journalism first"". #Irony #NLprimetime",1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the tweet is referencing a news channel (@ibnlive) and their behavior during primetime broadcasting.

2. claim: the tweet states that the channel is ""the first to cut to ads during primetime.""

3. contradiction: the channel claims they're ""putting journalism first,"" but they're prioritizing advertisements during a crucial viewing time.

4. hashtags: the use of #irony is a clear indicator that the author finds this situation contradictory or absurd.

5. tone: the use of ""proudly announce"" in this context suggests mockery, as cutting to ads is generally not something a news channel would proudly promote, especially if they claim to prioritize journalism.

6. overall message: the tweet is criticizing the news channel for claiming to prioritize journalism while actually prioritizing advertisements.

7. use of quotation marks: the phrase ""putting journalism first"" is in quotes, suggesting skepticism or disbelief in the claim.

given these observations, particularly the use of #irony and the clear contradiction between the channel's claim and their actions, we can conclude that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

1. context: the text appears to be a reply to multiple users on a social media platform, likely twitter.

2. content analysis:
   - the text mentions ""white skin"" and ""racist dna"" in quotation marks.
   - it refers to someone as a ""geneticist.""
   - the message ends with ""#not.""

3. tone and language:
   - the text uses exaggerated and absurd claims (""racist dna"").
   - it mockingly refers to someone as a geneticist.
   - the use of ""i think"" followed by clearly ridiculous statements suggests insincerity.

4. key indicator:
   - the ""#not"" at the end is a clear signal that the preceding statement is meant to be taken as the opposite of what was said.

5. interpretation:
   - the author is clearly not seriously suggesting that white skin or ""racist dna"" are real concepts.
   - they are mocking someone else's views or statements by presenting them in an exaggerated, absurd manner.
   - the ""#not"" hashtag confirms that the entire statement is meant to be read as the opposite of what it says.

conclusion: based on the exaggerated language, mocking tone, and especially the use of ""#not,"" this text is clearly meant to be sarcastic.

#hi #good #morning #instadaily #snapchat #selfie #comment # #sleep #do #not #wake #up @ Happy http://t.co/PTs2oMnYy6,0,"let's think through this step by step:

1. first, let's analyze the content:
   - the text is primarily composed of hashtags.
   - most hashtags are common, positive, or neutral terms: #hi, #good, #morning, #instadaily, #snapchat, #selfie, #comment

2. then we encounter an unusual sequence:
   - #sleep #do #not #wake #up
   - this sequence forms a complete phrase when read together: ""sleep do not wake up""

3. consider the context:
   - the message ends with ""@ happy"" followed by a link.
   - the phrase ""sleep do not wake up"" contrasts sharply with the idea of a ""good morning"" and being ""happy"".

4. evaluate the contradiction:
   - telling someone to have a good morning but then suggesting they should not wake up is inherently contradictory.
   - this contradiction is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

5. consider the platform:
   - this appears to be from a social media platform (given the hashtags and link sharing).
   - social media is a common place for sarcastic or ironic comments.

6. overall impression:
   - the seemingly positive hashtags combined with the contradictory message ""sleep do not wake up"" followed by ""happy"" creates an ironic or sarcastic tone.
   - the use of excessive hashtags could also be a form of sarcastic exaggeration of typical social media behavior.

given this analysis, the message appears to be using sarcasm to comment on the nature of ""good morning"" posts or the general positivity often portrayed on social media.

So there used to be a crossfit place here.... #irony #pizzawins http://t.co/9BDkxT9GFJ,1,"let's think through this step by step:

1. first, let's analyze the content of the tweet:
   - it mentions a crossfit place that used to be somewhere.
   - it uses hashtags #irony and #pizzawins.
   - there's a link to an image (which we can't see, but it's likely relevant).

2. consider the context:
   - crossfit is known for promoting fitness and health.
   - the hashtag #pizzawins suggests that a pizza place may have replaced the crossfit gym.

3. look at the language used:
   - the phrase ""so there used to be..."" sets up an expectation.
   - the ellipsis (....) implies there's more to the story, creating suspense.

4. examine the hashtags:
   - #irony explicitly points to the tweet being ironic.
   - #pizzawins further emphasizes the contrast between fitness (crossfit) and indulgence (pizza).

5. interpret the overall message:
   - the tweet is pointing out the irony of a fitness-focused business being replaced by one that sells food typically considered unhealthy.
   - the author finds humor in this situation, which goes against expected health trends.

6. consider the definition of sarcasm:
   - sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant, usually to criticize or mock.
   - while this tweet is ironic, it's not necessarily saying the opposite of what's meant.

### label: sarcastic

reasoning: although the tweet uses irony rather than pure sarcasm, in social media contexts, irony and sarcasm are often used interchangeably. the explicit use of #irony, the implied contrast between crossfit and pizza, and the humorous tone all point to a sarcastic intent. the author is using this contrast to make a witty observation about the change in businesses, likely mocking the idea of health trends being replaced by indulgence.",1

http://t.co/biWk2vGWPX #PhatSexyAss #Picnic Picnic Porked Tiffany,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the content of the input:
   - it starts with a url (likely a link to an image or website)
   - it includes hashtags: #phatsexyass and #picnic
   - the text ""picnic porked tiffany"" follows

2. consider the context and language:
   - the phrase ""phat sexy ass"" is crude and objectifying
   - ""picnic porked tiffany"" is a play on words, combining ""picnic"" with a vulgar term for sexual activity

3. evaluate the tone:
   - the message doesn't seem to be conveying a sincere sentiment about picnics or a person named tiffany
   - instead, it's using suggestive language and wordplay

4. look for irony or incongruity:
   - the juxtaposition of ""picnic"" (typically innocent) with sexual innuendo creates a jarring contrast
   - this unexpected combination is often a hallmark of sarcasm or crude humor

5. consider the intent:
   - the message appears to be making a joke or mocking statement rather than a straightforward comment
   - it's likely meant to be provocative or humorous in a crass way

6. final assessment:
   - while this message is more accurately described as crude humor than traditional sarcasm, the unexpected pairing of concepts and the likely intent to provoke a reaction align more closely with sarcastic content than sincere communication.

1. context: the tweet is addressing gary lineker (@garylineker) and mentions the champions league (@championsleague) and manchester city (@mcfc).

2. content: the tweet suggests that something will be ""out of form scandinavian reef again,"" which doesn't make immediate sense and could be a typo or intentional nonsense.

4. hashtags: the tweet includes #irony, which is a strong indicator that the author intends the message to be taken as ironic or sarcastic.

1. first, let's look at the literal meaning of the statement:
   ""i literally love when someone throws me in at the deep end""

2. now, let's consider the context and tone:
   - the phrase ""throw me in at the deep end"" is an idiom meaning to force someone to deal with a difficult situation without preparation.
   - generally, people don't actually enjoy being put in challenging situations unprepared.

3. let's examine the use of ""literally"":
   - the word ""literally"" is often misused in casual speech for emphasis.
   - in this case, it's unlikely the speaker truly means they literally love this situation.

4. looking at the hashtags:
   - #irony is a direct indicator that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.
   - #tough and #life suggest that the speaker is actually commenting on life's difficulties.

5. considering the overall message:
   - the speaker is using exaggeration and irony to express frustration with being put in difficult situations.

6. conclusion:
   the use of ""literally,"" the contrasting sentiment with the idiom's meaning, and especially the #irony hashtag all point to this being a sarcastic statement.

   - the use of ""haha"" suggests a lighthearted or humorous tone.
   - the incomplete sentence ""you may think we are, but we are..."" implies a setup for a joke or contradictory statement.

4. sarcasm indicators:
   - the hashtag ""#not"" in the middle of the phrase ""we are not mind readers"" is a common way to indicate sarcasm on social media.
   - the incomplete sentence sets up an expectation that will likely be subverted in the full post, which is a common sarcastic technique.

   - this contrast between expectation and reality is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

4. the use of ""#not really"":
   - this hashtag explicitly signals that the previous statement should not be taken at face value.
   - it's a clear marker of sarcastic intent.

4. implied meaning:
   - the author seems to be implying that using five police officers for speed cameras is excessive and a waste of resources.

5. contradiction and exaggeration:

   - this contradiction is likely intentional to highlight the perceived absurdity of the situation.

6. use of emoji:
   - the laughing emoji (😂) at the end suggests the author finds humor in the situation, but not in a straightforward way.

7. overall intent:
   - the post seems to be criticizing the use of resources (five police officers) for what the author considers a simple task (setting up speed cameras).
   - the criticism is delivered through exaggeration and contradictory statements, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.

   - this is followed by several hashtags.

2. considering the literal meaning:
   - generally, people do not enjoy throwing up. it's an unpleasant experience.

What a golden morning. 😒 #not,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the text content:
   ""what a golden morning.""
   - on its own, this phrase seems positive and could be genuine appreciation for a nice morning.

2. now, let's look at the emoji used:
   😒 (unamused face)
   - this emoji typically indicates dissatisfaction, annoyance, or skepticism.
   - its use contradicts the positive message of the text.

3. let's consider the hashtag:
   #not
   - this hashtag is often used to negate or contradict the statement that precedes it.
   - it further reinforces that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.

4. analyzing the contradiction:
   - the positive text combined with a negative emoji and a negating hashtag creates a clear contradiction.
   - this contradiction is a common structure used in sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning.

5. considering the context:
   - the combination of these elements suggests that the speaker is actually having a bad morning or is unhappy about something, but is expressing it through sarcasm.

6. final assessment:
   - the use of positive language with contradicting elements (emoji and hashtag) is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

Sleep. SLEEP YOU STUPID IDIOT I WANNA LEAVE MY ROOM,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. tone: the text starts with a simple command ""sleep."" but quickly escalates to all caps and aggressive language, which is a stark contrast.

2. exaggeration: the sudden shift to uppercase letters and the use of ""you stupid idiot"" is an exaggerated response to someone not sleeping.

3. context: the speaker seems to be addressing themselves or perhaps a pet or child who won't go to sleep, preventing them from leaving their room.

4. frustration: the text conveys genuine frustration, but the extreme nature of the outburst suggests it's not meant to be taken entirely seriously.

5. self-awareness: the absurdity of yelling at someone to sleep (which would likely have the opposite effect) implies a level of self-awareness about the futility of the situation.

6. humor: the contrast between wanting sleep and aggressively demanding it creates a humorous contradiction.

7. intent: while the speaker may be genuinely frustrated, the exaggerated way they express it suggests they're being deliberately over-the-top, possibly for comedic effect.

considering these factors, particularly the exaggeration, self-awareness, and the humorous contradiction, this text appears to be using sarcasm to express frustration in a somewhat playful manner.

1. context: the text appears to be referencing lyrics from meghan trainor's song ""all about that bass,"" which celebrates body positivity, particularly for curvier bodies.

2. first part: ""every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top"" - this is a direct quote from the song and, on its own, is a positive, affirming statement.

3. sudden shift: ""unless you're skinny"" - this abruptly contradicts the previous statement, creating a jarring contrast.

5. hashtags: the author includes ""#shade"" and ""#sarcasm,"" explicitly indicating their intent.

2. tone: the overall tone is critical and dismissive.

3. key phrases:

"@MiddleChildSyn: You think my mom and I would get along better, she's a middle child too. #irony #middlechildsyndrome",1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the tweet is from a user named @middlechildsyn, which suggests they identify as a middle child.

2. content: the user is talking about their relationship with their mom and mentioning that their mom is also a middle child.

3. tone: the tweet has a seemingly positive suggestion that the user and their mom would get along better because of this shared trait.

4. hashtags: the user includes #irony and #middlechildsyndrome.

5. implication: the use of #irony suggests that the statement is meant to be understood as the opposite of what is literally said.

6. middle child syndrome: this refers to a hypothetical condition where middle children feel neglected or overlooked. the hashtag reinforces this concept.

7. sarcastic intent: by saying they would get along better because they're both middle children, the user is likely implying the opposite – that being middle children doesn't actually improve their relationship.

8. use of irony: the statement is ironic because it suggests a positive outcome (getting along better) based on a trait (being middle children) that is stereotypically associated with feeling neglected or misunderstood.

considering these factors, especially the explicit use of #irony and the contradiction between the literal statement and the implied meaning, we can conclude that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

1. first, we need to identify key elements of the text:
   - the tweet starts with ""isn't this blaming the victim?""
   - it includes a hashtag ""#sarcasm""
   - it's retweeting (rt) another tweet about college students being injured while drunk

2. the phrase ""isn't this blaming the victim?"" is a rhetorical question. this type of question is often used in sarcastic statements.

3. the presence of ""#sarcasm"" is a direct indicator that the author intends the tweet to be read as sarcastic.

4. the retweeted content about drunk college students getting injured is likely the target of the sarcasm. the author seems to be criticizing the implication that the students are to blame for their injuries.

5. the combination of the rhetorical question and the explicit sarcasm tag strongly suggests that the author is not agreeing with the sentiment of the original tweet, but rather criticizing it through sarcasm.

6. the sarcasm here is used to highlight the problematic nature of blaming drunk students for their injuries, rather than addressing the broader issues that lead to such situations.

given these observations, especially the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag and the rhetorical question format, we can confidently conclude that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

Being a light sleeper is the best. #not,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the statement: ""being a light sleeper is the best.""
   - on the surface, this sounds like a positive statement about being a light sleeper.

2. however, being a light sleeper is generally considered inconvenient or problematic:
   - light sleepers often have trouble getting enough rest.
   - they are easily awakened by small noises or disturbances.
   - this can lead to fatigue and irritability.

3. the use of ""the best"" is likely an exaggeration:
   - it's unusual for someone to genuinely think being a light sleeper is the best quality.

4. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator:
   - in internet slang, adding ""#not"" at the end of a statement is a way to indicate sarcasm.
   - it's essentially saying ""not really"" or ""just kidding"" about the preceding statement.

5. the combination of the exaggerated positive statement about a generally negative trait, along with the ""#not"" tag, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to express frustration or annoyance with being a light sleeper, while pretending to praise it. the ""#not"" tag confirms the sarcastic intent.",1

@MyzzCryz not worried about it. Whenevs 😉,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: this appears to be a social media reply, likely twitter, given the ""@"" username format.

2. content:
   - ""not worried about it"" - this seems like a casual, relaxed response to something.
   - ""whenevs"" - this is a very informal, shortened version of ""whenever.""
   - the use of a winking emoji (😉) at the end.

3. tone:
   - the overall tone is very casual and laid-back.
   - the winking emoji often implies playfulness, a shared joke, or a hidden meaning.

4. possible interpretations:
   a) literal: the person is genuinely not worried and is flexible about timing.
   b) sarcastic: the person might actually be worried or annoyed about timing but is expressing it indirectly.

5. analysis:
   - the extreme casualness of ""whenevs"" combined with the winking emoji suggests there might be more to this message than face value.
   - the wink, in particular, often implies that the preceding statement shouldn't be taken entirely at face value.
   - there's a contrast between ""not worried"" and the wink, which could indicate sarcasm.

6. conclusion:
   while it's a subtle case, the combination of the overly casual ""whenevs"" and the winking emoji suggests that this message is likely not meant to be taken entirely literally. the sender is probably using gentle sarcasm to express some level of concern or annoyance about timing, while maintaining a friendly tone.

   - sarcastic: the person might be mocking the idea that something is insufficient, implying the opposite.

5. tone consideration:
   - without more context, the tone is ambiguous. it could be read as sincere disappointment or as a dry, sarcastic comment.

6. lack of clear sarcastic indicators:
   - there are no obvious exaggerations, contradictions, or absurd statements that typically signal sarcasm.
   - the brevity and directness of the statement lean more towards a straightforward expression.

conclusion: while sarcasm can't be completely ruled out without more context, the statement appears more likely to be a genuine expression of disappointment rather than a sarcastic comment. the straightforward nature and lack of clear sarcastic markers suggest it's probably not intended as sarcasm.

   - it starts with laughter (""hahaha"")
   - it uses excessive emojis (😂😂😂)
   - it ends with ""#not"" followed by a gun emoji (🔫)

"It's really #NOT #GOOD, too have the #REPUTATION for STEALING FROM GIRLS. @HAUSOFSE7EN & Mr. MASON,..expect a call,..(;",0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. tone and formatting:
   - the text uses excessive capitalization and hashtags, which can be a sign of emphasis or exaggeration.
   - the use of ellipsis and winky face (;) at the end suggests a hidden meaning or implication.

2. content analysis:
   - the statement ""it's really #not #good"" is an understatement, considering the serious nature of the accusation (stealing from girls).
   - using hashtags for ""not"" and ""good"" seems to be emphasizing the opposite of what's being said.

3. context and implication:
   - the author is talking about having a reputation for stealing, which is generally considered a negative thing.
   - however, the way it's phrased suggests they might not actually view it as entirely negative.

4. the threat at the end:
   - ""expect a call"" implies some form of consequence, but it's presented in a casual, almost playful manner.

5. overall message:
   - the text seems to be making light of a serious accusation, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
   - there's a discrepancy between the surface-level meaning and the implied meaning.

5. lack of obvious sarcastic markers: there are no exaggerated statements, no use of humor, and no clear contradiction between what's said and what might be meant.

   b. it might be a critique of overuse of these terms.
   c. it could be sarcastic, implying that not using these words doesn't make racism go away.

2. tone: the tone seems serious and determined, not playful or humorous.

3. hashtags: 
   - #att: refers to the company at&t
   - #wfaa: likely refers to a local news station
   - #not: this could be a potential indicator of sarcasm, but in this context, it seems to be part of the phrase ""not stopping""

Acronyms because we're cool as fuck. Judge me. http://t.co/0CK2VNqIKR,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. tone and language:
   the text uses casual, informal language with profanity (""cool as fuck""), which can be indicative of either genuine enthusiasm or sarcasm.

2. context:
   the speaker is talking about using acronyms, implying that they or their group use them frequently.

3. explicit statement:
   ""...because we're cool as fuck"" is an overly enthusiastic declaration of coolness, which often comes across as insincere or self-mocking.

4. challenge to the reader:
   ""judge me"" is a provocative statement, daring the reader to form an opinion. this can be seen as defiant or self-aware.

5. link inclusion:
   the presence of a link suggests there might be additional context or an image related to the statement, possibly showcasing examples of acronym use.

6. overall impression:
   the combination of overstated coolness, the challenge to judge, and the casual tone strongly suggests that the speaker is not genuinely boasting about their coolness or acronym use, but rather poking fun at the practice or themselves.

Only a true nightshift person would understand this #nightshift #hardcore #teamwork #not #always... http://t.co/MpsXN3DJqU,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's look at the content of the tweet:
   ""only a true nightshift person would understand this #nightshift #hardcore #teamwork #not #always... http://t.co/mpsxn3djqu""

2. the tweet starts with ""only a true nightshift person would understand this,"" which seems to be setting up an exclusive or insider perspective.

3. the hashtags used are interesting:
   - #nightshift and #hardcore suggest pride or intensity in working night shifts
   - #teamwork is generally positive
   - #not and #always are contradictory, which is a potential red flag for sarcasm

4. the use of ""..."" at the end suggests there's more to the story or implies something left unsaid.

5. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/mpsxn3djqu) implies there's additional content we can't see, which could provide context for the sarcasm.

6. the combination of ""#not"" and ""#always"" is particularly telling. this contradiction is a common sarcastic device, implying that the opposite of what's being said is true.

7. the overall tone seems to be making fun of the idea that night shift work is somehow special or exclusive, using exaggeration (""only a true nightshift person"") and then undermining it with the contradictory hashtags.

given these observations, especially the contradictory hashtags and the exaggerated tone, it seems likely that this tweet is meant to be sarcastic. the author appears to be poking fun at the notion of night shift work being particularly special or hardcore.

1. first, let's analyze the content of the tweet:

3. let's examine the hashtags:

6. conclusion:
   - the tweet is using sarcasm to express displeasure about having to use their pump again.

5. the ""#irony"" hashtag: this explicitly labels the tweet as ironic, which is closely related to sarcasm.

6. overall tone: the tweet seems to be poking fun at the idea of still receiving ""santa's gifts"" at an age when most people have outgrown this tradition.

2. content analysis:
   - mentions ""o voted to let born alive die"" - this is likely referring to obama's voting record on abortion-related legislation.

4. intent evaluation:

   - ""to take the other side of that bet"" implies there's a bet or prediction involved
   - ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end indicates amusement or mockery

   - the addition of ""lol"" reinforces a mocking or sarcastic tone

4. implied meaning:
   - the speaker seems to be suggesting that the bet or prediction is so one-sided or obvious that no one would take the opposite position
   - by saying this with ""good luck,"" they're implying it's futile to even try

5. sarcasm indicators:
   - saying ""good luck"" for something presented as nearly impossible
   - using exaggeration (implying absolutely no one would take the bet)
   - the contrast between wishing luck and then laughing about it

conclusion: given the mocking tone, the use of ""good luck"" in a context where success is implied to be highly unlikely, and the addition of ""lol"" to emphasize the absurdity, this text is clearly sarcastic.

   - the statement presents this as a positive situation (""it is good that..."")

   - these express disappointment and frustration with the team's performance.

6. tone: the tweet starts by setting up an expectation (easy group) and then immediately contradicts it with the poor results. this contrast is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

7. intent: the author seems to be criticizing the team's performance by ironically calling it the ""easiest cl group"" when the results clearly don't reflect that.

conclusion: the tweet uses irony to express disappointment and criticism. the contrast between the ""easy"" group and the poor results, combined with the tone of frustration, strongly indicates sarcasm.

No one up? Okay cool #not,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. initial impression: the text seems short and casual, potentially implying sarcasm.

2. content analysis:
   - ""no one up?"" - a question that appears to be checking if anyone is awake or active.
   - ""okay cool"" - a seemingly nonchalant response to the lack of activity.
   - ""#not"" - this is a key element that changes the meaning of the entire statement.

3. contextual clues:
   - the use of ""#not"" at the end is a common internet/social media practice to indicate that the preceding statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning.

4. tone consideration:
   - the casual ""okay cool"" followed by ""#not"" creates a contrast that suggests the speaker is not actually fine with no one being up.

5. sarcasm indicators:
   - the ""#not"" hashtag is a strong indicator of sarcastic intent.
   - the apparent contradiction between the casual acceptance (""okay cool"") and the ""#not"" further supports a sarcastic reading.

6. overall interpretation:
   - the speaker is likely expressing frustration or disappointment that no one is up, but doing so in a sarcastic manner rather than stating it directly.

conclusion: based on this analysis, particularly the use of ""#not"" which is a clear marker of sarcastic intent, this text should be classified as sarcastic.

Just loveeee driving upstate in the snow #not,1,"let's think through this step by step:

1. first, let's look at the content of the text:
   ""just loveeee driving upstate in the snow #not""

2. now, let's break down the elements:
   a) ""just loveeee"" - the exaggerated spelling of ""love"" often indicates sarcasm.
   b) ""driving upstate in the snow"" - this is generally considered a challenging and potentially dangerous activity.
   c) ""#not"" - this hashtag is a clear indicator of sarcasm, used to negate the previous statement.

3. consider the literal meaning:

5. evaluate the sarcasm indicators:
   - exaggerated positive sentiment (""loveeee"")
   - describing an typically unpleasant situation as enjoyable
   - use of ""#not"" to explicitly signal sarcasm

6. conclusion:
   the combination of exaggerated positive sentiment about a typically unpleasant activity, followed by ""#not,"" is a clear use of sarcasm to express dislike for driving in snowy conditions.

1. initial impression: the statement seems to express enthusiasm for an unpleasant situation, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. content analysis:
   - ""i love getting up at 4:30"" - most people don't enjoy waking up very early, so claiming to love it is suspicious.
   - ""so i can wait on other ppl!"" - waiting on others, especially after waking up so early, is generally not considered enjoyable.

3. tone: the exclamation mark at the end adds emphasis, which can be used to exaggerate the false enthusiasm in sarcastic statements.

4. context: getting up extremely early to serve others without expressing any negativity is unusual and likely not sincere.

5. hashtag: the tweet ends with ""#sarcasm"", which is an explicit indicator that the author intends the statement to be taken as sarcasm.

6. social media context: twitter (implied by the use of a hashtag) is a platform where sarcasm is common, especially in short, punchy statements like this.

1. context: the tweet mentions republicans, irony, and alanis morissette (a singer known for her song ""ironic"").

2. language use:

   - the comparison to alanis morissette is likely referencing her song ""ironic,"" which is often criticized for not containing actual irony in its lyrics.

3. intent analysis:

5. contradiction:

5. overall context:
   - the combination of the exaggerated initial statement, the ""#not"" tag, and the contradictory follow-up creates a classic sarcastic structure.

6. tone:
   - the tone is clearly mocking and dismissive, which is characteristic of sarcastic comments.

conclusion: based on the use of typical sarcastic structures (""#not""), the contradictory statements, and the overall mocking tone, this text is clearly intended to be sarcastic.

1. context: this appears to be a social media comment, likely twitter, given the @ mentions and hashtag.

2. content analysis:
   - the user is questioning the use of the term ""left regressives""
   - they're pointing out that this term itself is a label
   - they've added ""#irony"" at the end

3. understanding the irony:
   - the irony here is that someone (presumably in a previous comment) has used the term ""left regressives"" as a label
   - the commenter is pointing out that using this label while potentially criticizing labeling is ironic

4. tone and intent:
   - the use of quotation marks around ""left regressives"" suggests skepticism or criticism of the term

   - the addition of ""#irony"" is a clear signal that the commenter sees irony in the situation

5. sarcasm indicators:
   - while irony and sarcasm are related, they're not always the same
   - in this case, the comment is pointing out irony, but it's doing so in a fairly straightforward manner
   - there's no obvious exaggeration or mocking tone that would typically indicate sarcasm

1. context: the tweet is discussing a coaching search, presumably for a sports team.

2. content: the speaker is claiming that 3 weeks is not enough time to hire a coach, implying that this is an unreasonable expectation.

3. tone: the question ""who moves that quickly on a coaching search?"" is rhetorical and exaggerated, suggesting it's not meant to be taken literally.

4. hashtag: the tweet ends with ""#sarcasm"", which is a direct indicator that the content is intended to be sarcastic.

5. real-world knowledge: in reality, many sports teams can and do hire coaches within a 3-week timeframe, sometimes even faster.

6. contradiction: the statement contradicts common knowledge about coaching searches, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

7. intent: the speaker is likely criticizing someone (possibly brice_jones) for suggesting that 3 weeks is too short for a coaching search.

A #celebrity is a person who is known for his well-knownness. #fact #TeamFollowBack #irony,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the content of the tweet:
   - it defines a celebrity as ""a person who is known for his well-knownness.""
   - this definition is circular and doesn't actually provide any meaningful information.

2. let's look at the hashtags used:
   - #celebrity: relates to the subject of the tweet
   - #fact: suggests the statement is being presented as truthful
   - #teamfollowback: a common hashtag used to gain followers, not directly related to the content
   - #irony: this is a key indicator, as it explicitly states that the tweet is meant to be ironic

3. consider the definition itself:
   - the statement is paradoxical and somewhat nonsensical
   - it pokes fun at the concept of celebrity by suggesting that celebrities are famous simply for being famous, without any other merit

4. the use of ""#fact"" alongside ""#irony"" is contradictory:
   - this contradiction further emphasizes the sarcastic nature of the tweet

5. the circular logic in the definition is a common technique in sarcasm and satire:
   - it's used here to highlight the perceived absurdity of celebrity culture

conclusion:
given the circular definition, the contradictory hashtags (especially the explicit use of ""#irony""), and the satirical take on celebrity culture, this tweet is clearly meant to be sarcastic.

1. context: the tweet is talking about a basketball game and espn's coverage.

2. literal meaning: the speaker is expressing uncertainty about whether there's a basketball game today and noting that espn isn't promoting anything about it.

3. hashtag: the tweet ends with ""#sarcasm"", which is a clear indicator that the speaker intends the message to be interpreted sarcastically.

4. implied meaning: given the sarcasm tag, we can infer that the opposite of the literal meaning is true. this suggests that:
   a) there probably is a basketball game today.
   b) espn is likely promoting it heavily.

5. sarcastic element: the sarcasm lies in pretending not to know about a game that is presumably being heavily promoted, implying that espn's coverage is actually excessive or unavoidable.

6. tone: the use of ""i'm not really sure"" and the feigned ignorance about espn's promotion contributes to the sarcastic tone.

given these factors, especially the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag and the clear discrepancy between the literal and implied meanings, we can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

"If you've got the world on a string, you should give me some of that string, think of all the cool applications. #whatamidoing",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the literal meaning of the statement:
   - ""if you've got the world on a string"" is an idiom meaning someone is in control or very successful.
   - the speaker is asking for some of that ""string,"" implying they want some of that success or control.

2. now, let's look for signs of sarcasm:
   - the request for the ""string"" is absurd, as it's not a literal string.
   - the speaker is pretending to misunderstand the idiom deliberately.
   - they're suggesting ""cool applications"" for a metaphorical string, which is nonsensical.

3. the hashtag ""#whatamidoing"" at the end is crucial:
   - it's self-deprecating, implying the speaker knows they're saying something silly or nonsensical.
   - this hashtag is often used when someone is aware they're not making sense or doing something foolish.

4. the overall tone:
   - the statement is playful and not meant to be taken seriously.
   - it's a humorous take on the idiom, deliberately misinterpreting it for comedic effect.

5. intent of the speaker:
   - the speaker is likely trying to be funny by purposely misunderstanding the idiom and then acknowledging the absurdity of their statement.

conclusion:
given the deliberate misinterpretation of the idiom, the absurd request for a metaphorical item, and the self-aware hashtag at the end, this statement is clearly meant to be humorous and not taken literally. the speaker is using irony to create a comedic effect.

1. tone analysis:
   - the text begins with an exasperated ""christmas this christmas that""
   - the use of ""foh"" (which likely means ""f*** outta here"") indicates frustration
   - the phrase ""get a grip"" is often used to tell someone they're overreacting

2. content analysis:
   - the author is downplaying the importance of christmas
   - they're suggesting it's ""just a day""
   - there's a contrast between typical christmas expectations and ""chow some mopani worms""

3. context consideration:
   - christmas is generally considered an important holiday in many cultures
   - the author's attitude goes against this common sentiment

4. language use:
   - the informal language and abbreviations (foh, nd) suggest a casual, possibly irritated tone
   - the suggestion to eat mopani worms instead of traditional christmas food is unexpected and likely meant to be provocative

5. overall message:
   - the author is mocking people who make a big deal out of christmas
   - they're using hyperbole and unexpected suggestions to make their point

conclusion:
given the exaggerated tone, the mockery of common christmas enthusiasm, and the unexpected suggestion of eating mopani worms, this text is clearly using sarcasm to express frustration with christmas hype.

1. context: the tweet appears to be about appointments, specifically at an orthodontist's office.

2. language: the use of ""bitches be like"" is informal and often used in sarcastic or humorous contexts.

3. hashtags: 
   - #more #appointments #please: these seem to contradict each other. usually, people don't want more appointments, especially for orthodontic work.
   - #not#crazy#enough: this implies that having more appointments would make someone ""crazy,"" which is likely not meant literally.
   - yet: this emphasizes the previous hashtags, suggesting a progression towards ""craziness.""

4. overall tone: the combination of informal language, contradictory desires, and the implication of ""craziness"" suggests that the author is not being sincere.

5. intent: the author seems to be making a joke about the frequency of orthodontic appointments and their effect on one's mental state.

conclusion: given the contradictory nature of wanting more appointments (which are usually undesirable), the informal language, and the implication of ""craziness,"" this tweet is most likely intended to be humorous and not sincere.

I am so glad that I woke up early for this office visit to have to the mother not show up! #not,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. context: the statement is about waking up early for an office visit.

2. tone: the initial part of the sentence sounds positive (""i am so glad""), but this contrasts with the actual situation described.

3. situation: the person woke up early, but the mother (presumably a patient or client) didn't show up.

4. expectation vs. reality: there's a clear mismatch between the effort made (waking up early) and the outcome (wasted time due to no-show).

5. language: the use of ""so glad"" for a clearly frustrating situation is a classic sarcastic technique.

6. hashtag: the inclusion of ""#not"" at the end is a very clear indicator of sarcasm. it's explicitly stating that the opposite of what was said is true.

7. overall intent: the speaker is expressing frustration and disappointment through the use of false enthusiasm.

given these factors, especially the use of positive language to describe a negative situation and the explicit ""#not"" tag, we can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

1. context: the text is referring to cycling, specifically the rapha festive 500 challenge (a popular cycling event).

2. tone: the overall tone seems light-hearted and positive.

3. key phrases:
   - ""50km into the #rapha #festive500"": indicates they're participating in a cycling event.
   - ""we stop off for a coffee#1"": suggests they're taking a break during the ride.
   - ""toes are coming back to life"": this is the key phrase that hints at sarcasm.

4. interpretation of ""toes are coming back to life"":
   - literally, this would mean their toes were numb or very cold.
   - it's an exaggeration to imply how cold it was during the ride.
   - using this kind of hyperbole is often a sign of sarcasm.

5. social media context:
   - the use of hashtags and @ mention suggests this is a social media post.
   - people often use sarcasm or humorous exaggeration in social media to engage followers.

6. overall message:
   - the writer is likely trying to humorously convey that it's very cold, but they're enjoying the challenge and the coffee break.

@RailwaySloth u do really need to get a wee bit more lol,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the text appears to be a social media reply, likely on twitter given the ""@"" username format.

2. tone: the tone seems casual and somewhat playful, using informal language like ""u"" and ""wee bit"".

3. content analysis:
   - ""u do really need to"" - this phrase suggests a strong recommendation or critique.
   - ""get a wee bit more"" - this is an idiomatic expression suggesting someone needs to increase something slightly.
   - ""lol"" - this stands for ""laugh out loud"", often used to indicate humor or lighten the tone of a message.

4. interpretation:
   - the use of ""really need to"" followed by a suggestion to only increase ""a wee bit"" creates a contradiction.
   - the addition of ""lol"" at the end further suggests that the speaker isn't entirely serious.

5. sarcasm indicators:
   - the contradiction between the urgency of ""really need to"" and the minimal change suggested by ""wee bit""
   - the use of ""lol"" to indicate that the statement isn't meant to be taken at face value

6. conclusion:
   given the contradiction in the statement and the use of ""lol"" to indicate humor, this text is likely meant to be taken sarcastically. the speaker is probably playfully suggesting that the person they're addressing needs to make a much larger change than just ""a wee bit"", but is expressing this through understatement for humorous effect.

"@steveh603 so if they undo the affordable care act, and I should expect my insurance to decline 33%? #Not #Gonna #Happen",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. context: the tweet is referencing the affordable care act (aca), also known as obamacare.

2. claim: the tweet suggests that if the aca is undone, insurance costs should decline by 33%.

3. hashtags: the use of ""#not #gonna #happen"" at the end is crucial.

4. tone analysis:
   - the tweet starts with a seemingly sincere question.
   - however, the hashtags completely change the tone of the message.

5. interpretation of hashtags:
   - ""#not #gonna #happen"" implies that the author doesn't actually believe insurance costs will decline.
   - this phrase is often used to express disbelief or mockery of an idea.

6. contradiction:
   - there's a clear contradiction between the initial question (which sounds genuine) and the concluding hashtags (which express disbelief).
   - this contradiction is a common feature of sarcasm.

7. intent:
   - the author is likely criticizing the idea that repealing the aca would lead to significant cost savings.
   - they're using sarcasm to express skepticism about promised benefits of undoing the aca.

conclusion: given the contradictory nature of the tweet, the use of hashtags to express disbelief, and the overall mocking tone towards the idea presented, this tweet is clearly sarcastic.

@DaveNavarro @SpikeInkMaster #not sure who will take it home?,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the text appears to be a tweet or social media post directed at dave navarro and another user called spikeinkmaster.

2. content: the message says ""#not sure who will take it home?""

3. tone: the use of ""not sure"" could be interpreted in two ways:
   a) genuine uncertainty
   b) feigned uncertainty (which could indicate sarcasm)

4. hashtag use: the ""#"" before ""not sure"" is unusual. typically, hashtags are used for keywords or phrases without spaces. this odd usage might be a clue towards sarcastic intent.

5. question mark: the use of a question mark at the end suggests the speaker is posing a question, but it could also be rhetorical.

6. context consideration: without more context about what they're referring to (e.g., a competition or event), it's difficult to determine if this is a genuine question or a sarcastic comment.

7. ambiguity: the brevity and lack of clear context make it challenging to definitively determine sarcasm.

given these points, while there are some elements that could suggest sarcasm (unusual hashtag use, possible feigned uncertainty), there isn't enough clear evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the message could genuinely be expressing uncertainty about an outcome.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a possibility of sarcasm, without more context or clearer indicators, it's safer to interpret this as a genuine expression of uncertainty rather than a sarcastic comment.",0

1. content analysis:

   - the phrase ""don't you just love"" is often used sarcastically to express frustration or annoyance.

2. tone:
   - the overall tone is negative and irritated, despite the use of the word ""love.""

3. context:
   - this appears to be a social media post, likely on twitter, given the use of a hashtag.

4. hashtag:
   - the post ends with ""#sarcasm,"" which is a clear indicator that the author intends the statement to be understood as sarcastic.

5. contradiction:
   - there's a contradiction between the positive word ""love"" and the negative behavior being described, which is a common sarcastic technique.

6. exaggeration:
   - the use of ""just love"" to describe an obviously annoying situation is an exaggeration, another hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion:
given the contradictory language, the exaggeration, the negative tone masked by positive words, and most importantly, the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag, it's clear that this statement is intended to be sarcastic.

"@KAFosterSowell Oh, BELIEVE me. I agree totally. My tweet was pure #sarcasm. We need MORE #guns, not less. Santa is bringing me one. #2A",1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the tweet is responding to someone (@kafostersowell) and mentions #sarcasm explicitly.

2. content analysis:
   a) ""oh, believe me. i agree totally."" - this emphatic agreement is often a sign of sarcasm, especially when followed by contradictory statements.
   b) ""my tweet was pure #sarcasm."" - the author directly states that they are being sarcastic.
   c) ""we need more #guns, not less."" - this statement, in the context of sarcasm, likely means the opposite of what it says.
   d) ""santa is bringing me one."" - mentioning santa bringing guns is likely meant to be absurd and not serious.
   e) use of hashtags: #sarcasm, #guns, #2a (second amendment) - the combination of these suggests a commentary on gun rights.

3. tone: the overall tone is exaggerated and somewhat mocking, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

4. explicit declaration: the author clearly states that their tweet is sarcastic.

5. contradictory elements: agreeing with someone while simultaneously declaring sarcasm indicates that the agreement is not genuine.

The #Congressional #report on #torture #confirms that #AlQaeda was #not #involved in the #attacks of #September 11|http://t.co/GNBabcXR25,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's consider the content of the tweet:
   - it's referring to a congressional report on torture.
   - the report apparently confirms that al-qaeda was not involved in the september 11 attacks.

2. now, let's consider some context:
   - it's widely known and accepted that al-qaeda was, in fact, responsible for the 9/11 attacks.
   - this is not a controversial fact; it's been thoroughly investigated and confirmed.

3. let's analyze the tone:
   - the tweet is presenting information that contradicts widely known facts.
   - it's doing so in a straightforward manner, without any obvious markers of humor or exaggeration.

4. consider the implications:
   - if taken literally, this tweet would be spreading significant misinformation.
   - however, given the absurdity of the claim (that al-qaeda wasn't involved in 9/11), it's unlikely to be meant literally.

5. conclusion:
   - the tweet is likely using sarcasm to criticize the congressional report on torture.
   - it's implying that the report is so flawed or untrustworthy that it might as well be claiming al-qaeda wasn't involved in 9/11.

given this analysis, the most appropriate classification is:

### label: sarcastic

   - the message is tagged with ""#funfact"" and ""#whatifisay"".

2. tone consideration:

   - however, the use of hashtags, especially ""#whatifisay"", hints at a less serious tone.

3. context clues:
   - sarcasm is often used to say the opposite of what is meant.
   - the claim that sarcasm helps with emotional stress is counterintuitive, as sarcasm is often associated with negative emotions.

4. social media context:
   - the use of multiple hashtags is common in social media posts, often to add layers of meaning.
   - ""#funfact"" is sometimes used ironically to introduce statements that are not actually facts.

5. contradiction and exaggeration:
   - suggesting sarcasm is ""very effective"" for dealing with emotional issues is likely an overstatement.
   - this exaggeration is a common feature of sarcastic statements.

6. final consideration:
   - the combination of an unlikely claim, presented as fact, with tags that suggest a less serious tone, strongly indicates sarcasm.

given these observations, the text appears to be using sarcasm to ironically suggest that sarcasm is not actually helpful for emotional well-being.

1. first, let's look at the content of the text:
   ""also it is funny how things at work get done when i'm on my off week""

2. the statement seems to imply that work gets done better when the speaker is not there, which is counterintuitive and likely not what they actually believe.

4. the statement is followed by the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is a clear indicator that the speaker intends the statement to be taken sarcastically.

5. in social media, hashtags are often used to clarify the tone or intent of a message, especially when it might be ambiguous in text form.

   - the phrase ""great start to the week!"" is used.
   - there's a hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end.

Also it's amazing how a shower and Taco Bell can make you feel like a new person. @TacoBellProbbs,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the tweet mentions feeling like a new person after a shower and taco bell.

2. literal interpretation: a shower can make you feel refreshed, which is reasonable. however, taco bell, being fast food, isn't typically associated with feeling renewed or healthy.

3. exaggeration: the use of the word ""amazing"" to describe the combination of a shower and taco bell is likely an overstatement.

4. unexpected pairing: combining a shower (generally seen as refreshing) with taco bell (often considered unhealthy fast food) creates an unexpected and humorous contrast.

5. social media context: the use of ""@tacobellprobbs"" suggests this is part of a larger conversation or trend about taco bell-related experiences, which often involve humor or irony.

6. tone: the overall tone seems lighthearted and not entirely serious.

considering these factors, the statement appears to be using humor to exaggerate the effects of a shower and taco bell. the unexpected pairing and overstatement suggest a sarcastic intent rather than a genuine belief that taco bell is transformative.

I guess waking up every couple hours is cool |#not,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's analyze the content of the statement:
   ""i guess waking up every couple hours is cool""

2. on the surface, this statement seems positive about waking up frequently.

3. however, most people would not genuinely find it enjoyable to have their sleep interrupted regularly.

4. the use of ""i guess"" at the beginning suggests uncertainty or insincerity.

5. the addition of ""|#not"" at the end is crucial. in social media, adding ""#not"" is a common way to indicate sarcasm or that the opposite of what was just said is true.

6. the ""#not"" directly contradicts the seemingly positive statement, confirming that the speaker actually means the opposite.

7. this contradiction between the statement and the hashtag is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

given these points, especially the use of ""#not,"" which is an explicit marker of sarcasm, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly meant to convey that the speaker does not actually think waking up every couple of hours is cool, using sarcasm to express their frustration or displeasure with the situation.",1

Look good feel good! #not #TeamNoSleep #cantopeneyes,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's look at the main text: ""look good feel good!""
   - this is a common positive affirmation, usually meant sincerely.

2. now, let's examine the hashtags:
   - #not: this immediately suggests that the previous statement might not be true.
   - #teamnosleep: this implies the person hasn't slept much or at all.
   - #cantopeneyes: this further reinforces the idea of extreme tiredness.

3. let's consider the contrast:
   - the initial statement suggests feeling and looking good.
   - the hashtags imply the opposite: being extremely tired and unable to open one's eyes.

4. sarcasm often involves saying one thing but meaning the opposite:
   - the cheerful ""look good feel good!"" contrasts sharply with the reality expressed in the hashtags.

5. the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm:
   - it's explicitly stating that the opposite of the main text is true.

6. the overall effect:
   - the person is likely saying they look and feel terrible due to lack of sleep, but expressing it through a sarcastic use of a positive phrase.

3. follow-up statement: ""i see this way too often...""

4. link: the tweet includes a link, presumably to an image or article related to the topic.

5. tone analysis:
   - the question itself seems straightforward.
   - however, the follow-up statement ""i see this way too often..."" implies frustration or criticism.

6. interpretation:
   - the user is likely not genuinely asking about the cost.
   - instead, they're implying that they frequently encounter issues or errors with these government systems.
   - the question about cost is probably rhetorical, suggesting that a lot of money was spent on a system that doesn't work well.

7. sarcasm indicators:
   - the rhetorical question
   - the implication of frequent issues
   - the contrast between presumed high cost and poor performance

conclusion: based on these factors, the tweet appears to be using sarcasm to criticize government spending and inefficiency.

1. context: the tweet mentions skiing in regents park, which is a park in london, england.

2. hashtag: the tweet ends with ""#not"", which is often used to indicate sarcasm or irony.

3. realism: skiing in regents park is highly unlikely, as it's a city park that doesn't typically have enough snow or slopes for skiing.

4. tone: the use of ""much"" at the end of the sentence before ""#not"" suggests a mocking or sarcastic tone.

3. hashtag: the post ends with ""#irony""

4. tone: the tone is accusatory and critical.

5. use of ""#irony"": this is a key indicator. in social media, people often use hashtags to clarify their intent. the use of ""#irony"" suggests that the author is pointing out a contradiction or unexpected situation.

6. potential contradiction: the person described seems to have power or influence (able to rig votes) yet mocks vulnerable people (food bank users). this could be seen as ironic.

3. unexpected action: the text also mentions that afridi ""got a review right."" this implies that he successfully used the decision review system (drs), which is apparently not common for him.

4. tone: the question ""what the hell has happened to shahid afridi in last couple of days?"" suggests surprise and disbelief at afridi's behavior.

5. implied meaning: the author is not genuinely asking what happened to afridi. instead, they're expressing surprise at his uncharacteristic behavior in a humorous way.

6. exaggeration: the use of ""what the hell"" and pointing out multiple unexpected behaviors in a short period adds to the exaggerated tone.

7. contrast with expectations: the text plays on the contrast between afridi's usual playing style and decision-making, and his recent actions.

conclusion: given the exaggerated tone, the play on expectations, and the implied humor in pointing out uncharacteristic behavior, this text is clearly meant to be humorous and not literal.

@IsaJennie @deray @Nettaaaaaaaa but of course it was. Cops could shoot a black man in front of a hospital & I bet you he'd still get no aid.,0,"let's analyze this step-by-step to determine if the statement is sarcastic or not:

1. context: the tweet is responding to a conversation about police treatment of black individuals.

2. opening phrase: ""but of course it was"" 
   - this phrase often indicates sarcasm, especially when used to agree with something that's actually being criticized.

3. main statement: ""cops could shoot a black man in front of a hospital & i bet you he'd still get no aid.""
   - this is an extreme, exaggerated scenario.
   - it's presenting an obviously unethical and implausible situation.
   - the use of hyperbole is a common sarcastic technique.

4. tone: the overall tone is bitter and cynical, which often accompanies sarcasm when discussing serious issues.

5. intent: the author is likely trying to highlight perceived systemic racism and police brutality, not actually suggesting this would happen literally.

6. implied meaning: the author is criticizing the treatment of black individuals by police and the healthcare system, suggesting that even in the most obvious circumstances, proper care might be denied.

given these factors, especially the use of exaggeration and the bitter tone applied to a serious subject, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

I love it when people ignore me. #sarcasm,1,"certainly! let's analyze this input step by step to determine whether it's sarcastic or not.

step 1: examine the literal meaning
the statement ""i love it when people ignore me"" expresses a positive sentiment towards being ignored.

step 2: consider the context
generally, people don't enjoy being ignored. it's usually considered a negative experience.

step 3: look for contradictions
there's a clear contradiction between the positive sentiment expressed (""i love it"") and the typically negative experience of being ignored.

step 4: check for typical sarcasm indicators
the statement uses exaggeration (""love"") for something typically disliked, which is a common sarcastic technique.

step 5: analyze the tone
the tone seems overly enthusiastic about a normally undesirable situation, suggesting sarcasm.

step 6: look for explicit indicators
the text includes the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end, which is a direct indication that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.

conclusion:
given the contradiction between the expressed sentiment and the generally negative experience of being ignored, the exaggerated positive tone, and especially the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag, this statement is clearly intended to be sarcastic.

"@kaylakrebs5 not you, you're on pain medications 😂",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

2. content analysis:
   - the message is directed at @kaylakrebs5.
   - it states ""not you, you're on pain medications"".
   - there's a laughing emoji (😂) at the end.

3. tone assessment:
   - the phrase ""not you"" suggests an exception is being made for the person being addressed.
   - mentioning that someone is on pain medications in this context is unexpected and potentially humorous.
   - the laughing emoji indicates the speaker finds something funny about the situation.

4. implication:
   - the speaker is likely implying that being on pain medications affects @kaylakrebs5's judgment or behavior in some way.
   - this implication is made in a lighthearted manner, as evidenced by the emoji.

5. sarcasm indicators:
   - the contrast between ""not you"" and then immediately giving a reason why the person might actually be included is a common sarcastic structure.
   - using someone's medical state (being on pain meds) as a punchline often indicates playful or sarcastic intent.
   - the laughing emoji reinforces that this is meant to be taken humorously, not literally.

6. conclusion:
   the combination of the contradictory statement, the unexpected mention of pain medications, and the laughing emoji strongly suggest this is a sarcastic comment meant to tease or joke with @kaylakrebs5 in a friendly manner.

What a great Christmas. 😅 #not,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. surface meaning: the statement ""what a great christmas"" appears positive at first glance.

2. emoji usage: the use of the 😅 emoji (face with open mouth and cold sweat) typically indicates awkwardness, nervousness, or forced positivity. this doesn't align with the seemingly positive statement.

3. hashtag: the inclusion of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it directly contradicts the initial positive statement.

4. context clues: the combination of a positive statement with a contradictory emoji and hashtag strongly suggests the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.

5. tone: the brevity and simplicity of the statement, coupled with the contradictory elements, create a sarcastic tone.

6. intent: the speaker appears to be expressing disappointment or frustration about their christmas experience, but doing so through irony.

given these factors, especially the use of ""#not"" which is a common sarcasm marker, we can conclude that this statement is indeed sarcastic.

   - it's questioning how many food bank users have ""huge tvs"" or are ""drunks""
   - it uses hashtags #freedomofspeech and #foodbanks

2. let's analyze the tone and implications:
   - the question implies a negative stereotype about people who use food banks
   - it suggests that food bank users might be irresponsible with money (buying huge tvs) or have substance abuse issues (being drunks)

1. examine the statement: ""they working me so hard tonite""

2. consider the language used:
   - informal spelling: ""tonite"" instead of ""tonight""
   - grammatically incorrect: ""they working"" instead of ""they're working""

   - there's no additional context provided, which makes it challenging to determine the intent.

Jeez I wish the government paid for my food. #not #EBTbitches,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the statement is about government-funded food assistance (ebt - electronic benefit transfer).

2. tone: the use of ""jeez"" at the beginning suggests exasperation or frustration.

3. content: the person is expressing a wish for government-paid food.

4. hashtags:

1. initial statement: ""pretty shitty day""
   - this seems negative, but could be literal or sarcastic.

1. context: the tweet is talking about an experience on youtube, where ads and videos are common.

2. situation described: 
   - the ad plays without any issues (""flawlessly"")
   - the actual video content keeps buffering (implying poor playback)

3. expectation vs. reality:
   - expectation: the main content (video) should play smoothly
   - reality: the ad (which users typically want to skip) plays perfectly, while the desired content struggles

4. use of hashtags:
   - #irony is explicitly used, indicating the author's intent to highlight the contradictory nature of the situation
   - #youtube and @youtube are used to specify the platform and possibly draw attention to the issue

5. tone:
   - ""that moment when"" is often used to introduce relatable, frustrating, or amusing situations
   - the contrast between ""flawlessly"" and ""keeps buffering"" emphasizes the absurdity of the situation

6. intent:
   - the author is likely expressing frustration with youtube's service quality
   - they're using humor and irony to point out the perceived flaw in prioritizing ad delivery over content

conclusion:
given the explicit use of ""#irony"", the clear contrast between expectation and reality, and the humorous highlighting of a frustrating situation, this tweet is clearly intended to be sarcastic.

Perfect time to get sick 😢 #not,1,"let's think through this step by step:

1. first, let's look at the content of the message: ""perfect time to get sick 😢 #not""

2. on the surface, it seems to be saying that it's a perfect time to get sick. however, there are a few clues that suggest this isn't meant literally:

   a) getting sick is generally never considered a ""perfect"" time.
   b) there's a crying emoji (😢) which indicates sadness or frustration.
   c) the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to indicate sarcasm or that the opposite of what was just said is true.

3. the phrase ""perfect time"" is likely being used ironically. the person is probably implying that it's actually a terrible or inconvenient time to be sick.

4. the use of ""#not"" is particularly telling. this is a well-known marker for sarcasm, especially in social media contexts. it's used to contradict the statement that came before it.

5. the combination of the seemingly positive statement with the sad emoji and the ""#not"" creates a clear contrast, which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

given these observations, we can conclude that this statement is indeed sarcastic. the person is actually expressing frustration about being sick at an inconvenient time, using sarcasm to emphasize their displeasure.

   - the hashtags ""#hot or #not"" are commonly used genuinely on social media platforms.

"Change is a Process, ||#Not an Event dafuq you thinking",0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. context: the input appears to be a statement followed by a comment.

2. first part: ""change is a process, ||#not an event""
   - this seems like a genuine, thoughtful statement about the nature of change.
   - the use of ""||#"" might be a formatting or hashtag-like element.

3. second part: ""dafuq you thinking""
   - this is a colloquial, informal expression of disbelief or disagreement.
   - ""dafuq"" is a slang version of ""what the fuck,"" expressing surprise or confusion.

   - the use of crude language to undermine a serious statement

7. conclusion: the statement appears to be using sarcasm to mock or criticize the initial idea about change.

My son gave me a cold......again!!! Yay! #sarcasm #NotExcitedAboutThisShitAtAll,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. content analysis:
   - the speaker mentions getting a cold from their son.
   - they use ""yay!"" which is typically an expression of excitement.

2. tone evaluation:
   - the use of multiple exclamation marks (""!!!"") after mentioning the cold suggests strong emotion, but not likely positive given the context.
   - ""yay!"" in this context seems out of place for genuinely positive sentiment about getting sick.

3. hashtag examination:
   - ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly used, which is a direct indicator of sarcastic intent.
   - ""#notexcitedaboutthisshitatall"" further reinforces the negative sentiment, contrasting with the seemingly positive ""yay!""

4. contextual interpretation:
   - getting sick is generally not considered a positive experience.
   - the contrast between the apparently excited ""yay!"" and the reality of being ill indicates sarcasm.

5. overall sentiment:
   - the true sentiment is negative (frustration about being sick), but it's expressed through a facade of false enthusiasm.

conclusion:
given the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"", the contrast between the false enthusiasm and the reality of the situation, and the reinforcing negative hashtag, this text is clearly meant to be sarcastic.

1. context: the text is referring to #bbl04, which likely stands for big bash league (a cricket tournament in australia) season 4.

2. observation: the author is commenting on the height of the on-ground interviewers.

3. language use:
   - ""seriously"" at the beginning can often be a sarcastic indicator.
   - the use of hyperbole: ""tallest of all time"" and hashtags like ""#talltowers"" and ""#sevenfoot"" seem exaggerated.

4. tone: the overall tone seems to be one of exaggeration and possibly mock amazement.

5. intention: the author appears to be making a humorous observation about the interviewers' height, not genuinely inquiring or stating a fact.

6. social media context: the use of hashtags, especially exaggerated ones, is often associated with humorous or sarcastic posts.

   - it starts with hashtags ""#funny"" and ""#18+""
   - it mentions ""turn on aquabreeze"" and ""disgustinghotels""
   - it ends with ""#not all men"" and a link

2. the presence of ""#funny"" suggests the content might be humorous or intended to be amusing.

3. the phrase ""turn on aquabreeze"" doesn't provide much context, but ""disgustinghotels"" implies a negative sentiment about hotels.

4. the key element here is ""#not all men"". this hashtag is often used sarcastically to mock people who defend men when issues of sexism or misogyny are brought up.

5. the juxtaposition of ""disgustinghotels"" with ""#not all men"" seems incongruous and doesn't make logical sense in a straightforward way.

6. the use of seemingly unrelated elements (hotels, ""not all men"") in conjunction with ""#funny"" suggests this is likely an attempt at humor through absurdity or irony.

7. the sarcastic use of ""#not all men"" is a common internet meme, often employed to satirize defensiveness around gender issues.

given these factors, especially the use of ""#not all men"" in a context that doesn't directly relate to gender issues, and the labeling of this as ""#funny"", it's highly likely that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

   - they say they feel great.
   - there are hashtags indicating college stress and tiredness.

2. now, let's look for contradictions:
   - generally, 4 hours of sleep is not enough for most people to feel great.

   - the hashtags contradict the statement of feeling great:
     - #not suggests negation of the previous statement.
     - #collegeiskillingme implies stress and exhaustion.
     - #onemoreweek suggests they're barely hanging on.

4. consider the overall message:
   - the person is likely expressing that they're extremely tired and stressed from college.
   - the claim of feeling great is probably not meant to be taken literally.

5. conclusion:
   - the statement about feeling great despite little sleep is likely not sincere.
   - the contradictory elements and tone strongly suggest sarcasm.

1. context: the text is talking about a social media interaction on facebook.

2. language: the text uses informal, colloquial language (""ya mates dad"", ""poking you"").

3. hashtag: the use of ""#cringe"" suggests that the situation is uncomfortable or embarrassing.

4. emojis: the shocked face (😲) and grimacing face (😬) emojis reinforce the feeling of discomfort.

8. intent: the intent seems to be to share a genuinely awkward experience rather than to make a sarcastic comment.

conclusion: although the text is humorous and expresses discomfort, it doesn't contain clear indicators of sarcasm. the author appears to be genuinely describing an uncomfortable situation rather than using sarcasm to convey their message.

The #irony is anti state ppl will claim the little man (hacker) won when in reality the state won #sony,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's identify key elements in the text:
   - the use of ""#irony"" hashtag
   - mention of ""anti state ppl"" (people)
   - reference to ""the little man (hacker)""
   - mention of ""#sony""

2. the presence of ""#irony"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm, as people often use this hashtag to explicitly mark their statements as ironic or sarcastic.

3. the statement appears to be commenting on a situation involving sony, likely referring to a hacking incident.

4. the author is pointing out a contradiction: ""anti state ppl"" (presumably those against government control) will claim victory for ""the little man"" (the hacker), but in reality, the author believes the state (government) has won.

5. the contradiction between what people will claim and what the author believes to be true is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

6. the use of ""in reality"" further emphasizes the contrast between perception and the author's view of the actual situation, which is a sarcastic technique.

7. the overall tone suggests the author is mocking or criticizing the viewpoint of the ""anti state ppl.""

given these points, especially the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the structure of the statement that sets up a contradiction between perception and claimed reality, we can conclude:

#HowToGetUnfollowed Post pictures or videos of you smoking. Especially blowing smoke at the camera. #SoCool #Not #GTFO,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's look at the hashtag #howtogetunfollowed. this suggests that the content is about actions that would cause people to unfollow someone on social media.

2. the main content advises to ""post pictures or videos of you smoking. especially blowing smoke at the camera."" this is presented as a way to get unfollowed.

3. the hashtags at the end provide additional context:
   - #socool is typically used to describe something as cool, but in this context, it's likely meant ironically.
   - #not directly contradicts #socool, emphasizing that it's not actually cool.
   - #gtfo (get the f*** out) expresses strong disapproval of the described behavior.

4. the overall tone of the message is negative towards the act of posting smoking content, despite seemingly giving advice to do so.

5. the contradiction between the advice given and the clear disapproval expressed in the hashtags is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

6. the post is using irony to criticize people who post smoking content, implying that such behavior is actually uncool and will result in losing followers.

given this analysis, we can conclude that this post is intentionally using sarcasm to make its point.

7. structure: the tweet starts with a seemingly sincere description but uses hashtags to reveal the true, critical meaning.

2. hashtag: the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the author intends this statement to be interpreted ironically or sarcastically.

3. implied meaning: by using ""#irony"" in conjunction with human rights day, the author is likely suggesting that there's a contradiction between celebrating human rights and the actual state of human rights in the world.

4. tone: the brevity and straightforwardness of the statement, followed by the irony hashtag, creates a sharp contrast that enhances the sarcastic effect.

5. intent: the author is using sarcasm to critique or draw attention to perceived failures in upholding human rights, despite the existence of an international day dedicated to them.

6. classification: given the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the implied criticism, this statement is clearly meant to be taken sarcastically rather than at face value.

@houselanguage Thanks for pirating my music! :D #not,1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. context: the tweet is directed at @houselanguage, apparently in response to them pirating (illegally downloading or sharing) the author's music.

2. initial reaction: the first part of the tweet ""thanks for pirating my music!"" seems positive and grateful.

3. emoji: the "":d"" is a laughing or very happy face emoji, which also appears positive.

4. hashtag: the tweet ends with ""#not"", which is a common way to indicate that the preceding statement should be interpreted oppositely.

5. contradiction: the positive tone of the tweet (thanking someone for piracy) contradicts the usual reaction artists have to piracy, which is typically negative.

6. use of ""#not"": this explicitly signals that the preceding statement should be interpreted in the opposite way, confirming the sarcastic intent.

7. overall intent: the author is using a seemingly positive statement to express disapproval of the piracy, relying on the ""#not"" to reverse the meaning.

given these observations, particularly the use of ""#not"" and the contradiction between thanking someone for an action that is typically considered harmful to artists, we can conclude that this tweet is intentionally sarcastic.

Welcome to the surrealist estate agency!! http://t.co/IcLOrQ0P8d,0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. context: the text appears to be a tweet or social media post, given the url at the end.

2. phrase analysis:
   - ""welcome to"" is a standard greeting, but what follows is unusual.
   - ""surrealist estate agency"" is an oxymoron. real estate agencies deal with concrete, physical properties, while surrealism is about the irrational and dreamlike.

3. tone:
   - the use of double exclamation marks (!!) suggests exaggerated enthusiasm.

4. concept:
   - a ""surrealist estate agency"" is not a real thing. it's a playful, absurd concept that combines the practical world of real estate with the impractical world of surrealist art.

5. intent:
   - the author is likely not seriously advertising a real estate agency.
   - they are probably sharing something amusing or absurd related to property or housing.

6. url:
   - the inclusion of a url suggests there's more content to see, likely something visual that plays into the surrealist theme.

conclusion: the combination of an absurd concept (surrealist estate agency), exaggerated punctuation, and the playful tone strongly suggests that this is not meant to be taken literally. the author is using humor and irony to comment on something related to housing or property.

   - the speaker seems to be mocking the idea of people thinking they're clever or ahead of others.

6. overall impression:
   - the exaggerated tone, contradiction, and explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" all point strongly towards this being a sarcastic statement.

   - the emphatic ""#not!"" at the end, which is a classic indicator of sarcasm

7. intent: the speaker is clearly implying that they do not actually think this time allocation is fair, contrary to what the surface-level words might suggest.

@Mr_laddu and if Marathi man speak hindi to Chu*** samajhte hai #irony,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

   - it appears to be addressing someone on social media (indicated by the @ symbol).
   - the hashtag #irony is used at the end.

2. content analysis:
   - the tweet seems to be commenting on language dynamics between hindi and marathi speakers.
   - there's an implication that when a marathi person speaks hindi, they are perceived negatively (the censored word ""chu***"" likely refers to an insult).

   - the censored insult indicates frustration or criticism.

   - irony is often closely related to sarcasm, as both involve saying something different from what is meant.

5. overall message:

   - the sarcasm lies in highlighting this perceived unfairness through the use of irony.

conclusion:
given the explicit use of the #irony hashtag and the nature of the comment highlighting a perceived contradiction or unfairness, this tweet is most likely intended to be sarcastic.

   - #capitalism implies criticism of consumerist behavior.

4. tone:

Tomorrow three test signature.|Thank you. |#school #sarcasm,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. content analysis:
   - the first part ""tomorrow three test signature"" seems like a straightforward statement about upcoming tests.
   - ""thank you"" appears to be a polite expression of gratitude.
   - the hashtags ""#school"" and ""#sarcasm"" are included at the end.

2. context clues:
   - the presence of ""#school"" suggests this is related to an educational setting.
   - the inclusion of ""#sarcasm"" is a direct indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

3. tone and intent:
   - without the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag, this message would appear to be a simple, neutral statement about upcoming tests.
   - the ""thank you"" could be interpreted as genuine gratitude or, given the sarcasm tag, as an insincere expression.

4. sarcasm indicators:
   - the main indicator of sarcasm here is the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag.
   - without this hashtag, it would be difficult to detect sarcasm in the text itself.

5. social media context:

conclusion:
despite the text itself not containing obvious sarcastic elements, the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" indicates that the author intends for this message to be interpreted sarcastically. the sarcasm likely lies in the seemingly polite ""thank you"" for having three tests tomorrow, which would typically not be something students are grateful for.

1. context: the tweet seems to be referring to a situation or activity, possibly outdoor-related, given the hashtag ""#hibernot"".

2. phrase analysis:
   - ""we may be some time"" is a reference to a famous quote by antarctic explorer captain lawrence oates, who said ""i am just going outside and may be some time"" before walking out into a blizzard to his death.

3. hashtag interpretation:
   - ""#hibernot"" is likely a play on the word ""hibernate"", suggesting the opposite - not hibernating or staying active during winter.
   - ""#not"" could be emphasizing the idea of not hibernating, or it could be adding a layer of contradiction.

   - the contradiction between the implication of a long absence (""we may be some time"") and the active, non-hibernating theme creates a humorous contrast.

6. sarcasm indicators:
   - the juxtaposition of a grave historical quote with a modern, likely less serious activity.

   @planb: referencing plan b, an emergency contraceptive

4. comment:
   ""great commercial"": likely referring to an advertisement for plan b

   the combination of hashtags suggests the user is mocking or making light of birth control and plan b, particularly with the juxtaposition of #whatisbirthcontrol and @planb.

6. explicit indication:
   the use of #sarcasm at the end clearly indicates the user's intent.

Oh how I love working in Baltimore #not,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. initial statement: ""oh how i love working in baltimore""
   - this seems like a positive statement expressing love for working in baltimore.

   - this is a classic structure for sarcasm, where someone says something positive but immediately contradicts it.

5. intent of the speaker:
   - the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction with working in baltimore, but doing so through irony.

6. overall tone:
   - the statement is clearly not meant to be taken at face value. the speaker is using irony to convey the opposite of what is literally said.

Cook and England rudderless at the death. Seven games and we've got progressively worse! Can't wait 'till they arrive here for WC #sarcasm,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. context: the text is referring to cricket, specifically mentioning cook (likely alastair cook) and england, suggesting it's about the england cricket team's performance.

2. tone: the overall tone is negative and critical.

3. key phrases:
   - ""rudderless at the death"" - suggests poor leadership or direction in crucial moments
   - ""seven games and we've got progressively worse!"" - indicates a declining performance trend
   - ""can't wait 'till they arrive here for wc"" - seems to contradict the negative sentiment

4. contradiction: the last phrase ""can't wait 'till they arrive here for wc"" doesn't align with the negative sentiment expressed earlier. this is a classic sarcastic structure where someone says the opposite of what they mean.

5. hashtag: the text ends with ""#sarcasm"", which is an explicit indicator that the author intends the message to be read as sarcastic.

6. intent: the author is clearly expressing disappointment and frustration with the england cricket team's performance, using sarcasm to emphasize their point.

given these observations, especially the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag and the contradictory statement at the end, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

#we are #not #perfect but it is #neccesary for #us to #be the #best # version of #ourselves http://t.co/3IO7qLK0lr,0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. content:
   the tweet appears to be a motivational or inspirational message about self-improvement.

2. hashtag usage:
   there's excessive use of hashtags, almost turning every word into a hashtag. this could be seen as overdoing it, which might hint at sarcasm.

3. message tone:
   the message itself is positive and encouraging, which doesn't immediately suggest sarcasm.

4. spelling:
   there's a misspelling of ""necessary"" as ""neccesary."" this could be a genuine mistake or intentional to mock such inspirational posts.

5. structure:
   the structure is somewhat choppy due to the overuse of hashtags, which might be an attempt to mimic or exaggerate typical social media behavior.

6. link inclusion:
   the inclusion of a shortened link at the end is common in genuine posts, but could also be part of a sarcastic imitation.

7. overall impression:
   while the message itself is straightforward, the excessive use of hashtags and the slightly off structure gives an impression of potential mockery or exaggeration.

considering these factors, it's more likely that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic. the overuse of hashtags seems to be poking fun at the typical style of inspirational social media posts, rather than being a genuine attempt at motivation.

1. context: the input appears to be a tweet or social media post about an article from reuters.

2. content analysis:
   - the tweet mentions ""economic issues"" and ""chocolate pudding"" in the same context of an election.
   - the phrase ""whip up"" is used, which can have multiple meanings.

3. unusual combination:
   - combining serious economic issues with chocolate pudding in the context of an election is unexpected and odd.

4. wordplay:
   - ""whip up"" can mean to stir or beat (as in making pudding), but it's also used figuratively to mean ""to incite"" or ""to generate excitement.""
   - this dual meaning creates a pun between the economic issues and the chocolate pudding.

5. tone:
   - the juxtaposition of serious (economic issues, election) and trivial (chocolate pudding) topics suggests a mocking or satirical tone.

6. intent:
   - the writer seems to be making light of the election by comparing it to something as trivial as chocolate pudding, implying that the economic issues are being oversimplified or trivialized in the election discourse.

@SR_Duncan Three minutes is better than no minutes,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. context: this appears to be a response to someone named @sr_duncan, likely on a social media platform.

2. content: the statement ""three minutes is better than no minutes"" is being made.

3. literal meaning: at face value, this statement is true. having three minutes of something is indeed better than having none at all.

4. potential underlying meaning: however, three minutes is a very short amount of time. in most contexts, three minutes would be considered insufficient or barely worth mentioning.

5. tone: the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the comparison to ""no minutes,"" suggests a dry or deadpan delivery.

6. implication: the speaker is likely implying that three minutes is still a very short and potentially inadequate amount of time, while technically acknowledging it's better than nothing.

7. sarcasm indicators: the use of an obvious truth (three is more than zero) to potentially criticize or mock the short duration suggests sarcastic intent.

given these considerations, particularly the way a simple truth is used to potentially criticize or mock a short duration, this statement appears to be using sarcasm.

   - the tweet talks about finding motivation, but then equates it to ""the back of my eye lids.""
   - the author refers to themselves and another person as ""winners.""
   - hashtags include ""#not"" and ""#losers.""

   - the overall tone is self-deprecating and ironic.

4. use of ""#not"":
   - this hashtag is often used to negate the previous statement, indicating the opposite meaning is intended.

5. context:

6. intention:
   - the author seems to be making fun of their own lack of motivation and productivity.

conclusion:
the tweet uses contradictory statements, self-deprecating humor, and the ""#not"" hashtag to convey a message opposite to its literal meaning. the author is not actually proud of their lack of motivation but is expressing frustration through sarcasm.

2. hashtags:
   - #duh: this is often used to indicate something is obvious or stupid.
   - #redundantredundant: this hashtag is deliberately repeating the word ""redundant,"" which is itself a commentary on the redundancy of the statement.

   - however, this setup is immediately followed by a strongly negative characterization (""vile"").
   - this sudden shift from apparent neutrality to harsh criticism is a common sarcastic technique.

6. sarcastic elements:
   - the contrast between the expectation set up (political neutrality) and the actual opinion given (views are vile).
   - the use of ellipsis (...) to create a pause for dramatic effect before the punchline.

7. intent: the speaker is using this structure to emphasize their negative opinion of the other person's views in a cutting way.

given these observations, particularly the use of contrast and the sharp, unexpected criticism, this statement appears to be using sarcasm to make its point.

   - the text mentions ""gael 'pro at presentations' anderson""
   - it's followed by hashtags ""#not"" and ""#choke""

2. consider the structure:

Loving how dominant the SEC is #Pause ..... #Not,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. context: the tweet is about the sec (likely referring to the southeastern conference in college sports).

2. initial statement: ""loving how dominant the sec is""
   - this statement on its own seems positive and straightforward.

3. use of hashtags:
   - ""#pause"": this suggests a deliberate pause or break in thought.
   - ""#not"": this is a key indicator. ""not"" at the end of a statement is often used to negate everything said before it.

4. tone and structure:

   - the author is likely expressing frustration or disagreement with the idea that the sec is dominant.
   - they've chosen to do this through a sarcastic reversal rather than a direct statement.

conclusion: given the structure of the tweet, the use of ""#not"" to negate the initial statement, and the clear intent to say the opposite of what is initially expressed, this tweet is clearly sarcastic.

6. social media context:
   - including a photo link (http://t.co/ncat8xxqxq) suggests the user is sharing a genuine moment or comparison.

   - use of ""lol"" to signal the joke

Love waking up to no heat in my apartment #not #socold,1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. analyze the literal meaning:
   - the person is saying they love waking up to no heat in their apartment.

2. consider the context:
   - typically, people don't enjoy being cold, especially when waking up.
   - lack of heating in an apartment is usually seen as a problem, not something to love.

   - the statement ""love waking up to no heat"" contradicts common preferences.

4. check for hashtags or indicators:
   - ""#not"" is used, which often indicates the opposite of what's being said.
   - ""#socold"" reinforces that the person is actually cold and uncomfortable.

5. evaluate tone:
   - the tone is exaggerated positivity about a negative situation.

6. final assessment:
   - the contradiction between the stated love and the unpleasant situation, combined with the hashtags, strongly indicates sarcasm.
