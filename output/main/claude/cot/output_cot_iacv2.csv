"I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

"again, please review the definition of an atheist   humor cannot be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm. it is an abstract and intangible quality. so is beauty, artistic ability and pleasure. yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist. an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence. they can be detected through mental processing, and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present.   being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things. it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual/supernatural realm",0,not sarcastic,0
So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?,0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. first, we need to consider the context and tone of the statement.

2. the question ""does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?"" implies a misunderstanding of how scientific theories work.

3. scientific theories are often revised as new evidence emerges. this doesn't necessarily mean they were ""wrong,"" but rather that they've been refined or expanded.

4. the phrasing suggests the speaker is deliberately oversimplifying or misrepresenting the scientific process.

5. this oversimplification appears to be making a point about the nature of scientific theories in a mocking or ironic way.

6. the tone seems to be one of feigned ignorance or deliberately misunderstanding to make a point.

7. this kind of deliberate misrepresentation for effect is a common sarcastic technique.

given these considerations, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to comment on how some people misunderstand the scientific process.

2. the statement makes an extreme assumption about automatic weapons being ""obviously"" imported illegally.

3. it jumps to conclusions without evidence, which is a common sarcastic technique.

"What is your evidence they didn't do this? Remember, today's Coelacanth is different.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

2. the mention of ""coelacanth"" (a rare fish once thought extinct) seems out of context and abrupt.
3. the statement ""today's coelacanth is different"" doesn't make immediate logical sense in most contexts.
4. the combination of an apparently serious question with an absurd comparison suggests irony.
5. the abrupt shift to coelacanths likely indicates the speaker is not actually expecting a serious answer.
6. this kind of non-sequitur is often used in sarcastic statements to highlight the perceived absurdity of the original claim or question.

given these observations, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to mock or dismiss the idea being discussed.

   - it's using exaggeration to make a point about the absurdity of the comparison.

4. evaluate the overall intent:
   - the statement is not meant to be taken literally.
   - it's using irony to criticize a particular viewpoint.

5. conclusion:
   - given the use of irony, the mocking tone, and the criticism of a common argument through exaggeration, this statement is clearly sarcastic.

"How many cases have there been of a person having their personal firearm taken right out of their hands by a criminal, never to be seen again?",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the question is phrased in a way that seems to be challenging a common pro-gun argument.

2. it's asking for specific cases of a scenario that gun advocates often use to justify carrying firearms for self-defense.

3. the phrasing ""taken right out of their hands"" and ""never to be seen again"" is exaggerated and dramatic, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

4. the question implies skepticism about the likelihood of this scenario actually occurring.

5. it's not seeking a genuine answer, but rather making a point through the form of a question.

6. the tone suggests that the author believes such cases are rare or non-existent, contradicting the implied stance of those who use this argument.

given these observations, the question appears to be using irony to criticize or mock a particular pro-gun argument.

I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.,0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.,0,"1. let's consider the context:
   - the brady law is a gun control measure in the us.
   - it's meant to prevent criminals from obtaining handguns.

2. analyze the statement:
   - ""sounds like"" suggests the speaker is drawing a conclusion.
   - the statement implies the law has been effective.

3. consider the likely reality:
   - gun control laws are often criticized for being ineffective.
   - criminals often find ways around such laws.

4. detect the tone:
   - the statement seems overly positive given the usual debates around gun control.
   - this exaggerated positivity is a common sarcastic technique.

5. conclusion:
   - the speaker is likely implying the opposite of what they're saying.
   - this is a classic use of sarcasm.

1. the text contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which could be intentional to mock a certain viewpoint.

2. the content presents an extremely simplistic and scientifically inaccurate explanation of dinosaur extinction and the biblical flood.

3. it makes absurd claims, such as dinosaurs sinking because they're heavier than humans, and humans floating.

4. the statement about dinosaurs still being seen in congo today is a reference to cryptozoology myths, not accepted scientific fact.

5. the overall tone and content seem to be mocking young-earth creationist or extreme biblical literalist views.

6. the combination of deliberate misspellings, logical fallacies, and outlandish claims strongly suggests this is not a sincere statement.

given these observations, the text appears to be an exaggerated parody of certain beliefs, using humor to highlight their perceived absurdity.

However, the reason drunk driving is illegal is that it endangers everyone on the road around the driver.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

So what else is new? Does Texas support the death penalty?,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the question ""so what else is new?"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is unsurprising or typical.

2. the following question ""does texas support the death penalty?"" is asking about a well-known fact. texas is famously known for its strong support of capital punishment.

3. combining these two elements, the speaker appears to be using sarcasm to comment on texas's well-established stance on the death penalty.

4. the implication is that texas supporting the death penalty is so obvious and expected that it's not even news, hence the sarcastic ""so what else is new?""

"I agree.That was the most pathetic, dishonest and downright idotic commentary on communism/socialism I've ever encountered. I have a VERY hard time believing that someone could actually post that with a straight face. Good one Comrade Brian. :p Waxy",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the comment starts with ""i agree,"" which initially seems straightforward.

2. however, it then describes something as ""the most pathetic, dishonest and downright idotic commentary on communism/socialism.""

3. the use of extreme negative descriptors (pathetic, dishonest, idiotic) is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

"No. The pot should not have rights. You, however, should stop dropping acid :)",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the first sentence ""no. the pot should not have rights."" seems to be a direct, non-sarcastic statement.

2. however, the second sentence ""you, however, should stop dropping acid :)"" changes the tone entirely.

3. this second sentence implies that the person who suggested the pot should have rights must be under the influence of drugs (specifically acid).

2. the phrase ""descending from monkeys and slimeball"" is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of evolutionary theory, which is often used sarcastically by those who oppose it.

3. the suggestion that ""all ppl need is a bit more education"" implies that those who believe in evolution are uneducated, which is a common sarcastic argument used by evolution deniers.

4. the final phrase ""things should become clearer"" suggests that with education, people would reject evolution, which is contrary to the fact that increased scientific education typically leads to greater acceptance of evolutionary theory.

"i've no problems with gay couples marrying if they have kids
 straight couples can adopt as well",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. first, we need to understand the context and tone of the statement.

2. the first part ""i've no problems with gay couples marrying if they have kids"" seems to imply a condition for accepting gay marriage.

3. this condition (having kids) is not typically associated with the right to marry, which suggests an unusual or illogical requirement.

4. the second part ""straight couples can adopt as well"" appears to be a counter-argument to the first statement.

5. by mentioning adoption for straight couples, it highlights the absurdity of the first condition, as having biological children is not a requirement for any couple to marry.

6. the juxtaposition of these two statements creates an ironic contrast, pointing out the flawed logic in the first statement.

7. the overall effect is to ridicule the idea of placing conditions on gay marriage, particularly one as arbitrary as having children.

1. the text is discussing stem cell research and its potential risks and benefits.
2. the tone is mostly serious and informative, not exaggerated or mocking.
3. there's one instance that could be considered mildly sarcastic: ""maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonxrolleyes""

1. the text starts with ""yes i know,"" which can often be a preface to a sarcastic statement.

2. the speaker acknowledges that ""a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute behe's work."" this seems straightforward and not necessarily sarcastic.

3. the phrase ""from your link;"" suggests the speaker is referring to information provided by someone else.

4. the statement ends abruptly with ""let's think step by step."" this doesn't seem to connect directly with the previous content and appears to be an instruction rather than part of the original text.

5. there's no clear indication of irony or mocking tone that would typically characterize sarcasm.

If you think that it's OK when the Mother's life is in danger. Why wouldn't it be OK when her life isn't in danger?,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the statement is framed as a question, which often indicates rhetorical or sarcastic intent.
2. it presents a logical inconsistency: comparing a situation where abortion is generally considered acceptable (when the mother's life is in danger) to a situation where it's more controversial.
3. the question implies that if one accepts abortion in life-threatening situations, they should logically accept it in all situations - which is an oversimplification of a complex issue.
4. this oversimplification and apparent lack of nuance suggests the speaker is not earnestly seeking an answer, but rather making a point through irony.
5. the tone seems to mock the reasoning of those who support abortion only in specific circumstances.

given these observations, the statement appears to be using irony to criticize a particular stance on abortion, rather than genuinely asking for information.

It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the text is serious and analytical, not mocking or ironic.
2. the author is discussing constitutional interpretation and loopholes.
3. they're acknowledging different perspectives (kronos' view and constitutional scholars).
4. the language is straightforward and explanatory, not exaggerated or contradictory.
5. the content discusses a real legal and political issue (efforts to amend the constitution regarding marriage).
6. there's no evident contradiction between what's said and what's meant.

1. the text begins with ""it seems that"", which often introduces a sarcastic or ironic statement.

2. the phrase ""high priest of global warming"" is clearly not meant literally, but is a mocking title for someone who strongly advocates for climate change action.

3. the text points out a contradiction between the person's (likely al gore's) public stance on global warming and their personal energy consumption.

4. the large amount of electricity consumption is emphasized, comparing it to the usage of 232 average households.

5. the tone of the text is clearly critical and implies hypocrisy.

6. the inclusion of a news link suggests this is meant to expose or criticize, rather than simply inform.

He only understands natural selection when he belives that it goes against what is accepted by scientists.,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the sentence implies that the person only accepts natural selection when it contradicts scientific consensus.

2. this is a paradoxical stance, as natural selection is a well-established scientific concept.

3. the statement suggests that the person's understanding is selective and biased, only aligning with their preconceived notions.

4. the irony lies in the fact that they claim to understand natural selection, but only when it goes against scientific acceptance - which is contradictory.

5. the tone of the statement is mocking the person's inconsistent and illogical approach to understanding scientific concepts.

6. the use of irony to criticize or mock someone's behavior is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given these points, the statement is clearly using irony to mock someone's inconsistent beliefs, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

1. the text begins with a rhetorical question that seems to be challenging or mocking someone's viewpoint.

2. the use of ""but let me guess..."" and the ellipsis (...) suggests a sarcastic tone.

3. the author uses phrases like ""right after"" and ""simply because"" in a way that seems to be exaggerating or mocking a position.

4. there's an eye-rolling emoticon, which often indicates sarcasm or frustration.

5. however, after this initial part, the tone shifts to a more serious and thoughtful discussion about the responsibilities of county officials.

6. the latter part of the text presents a logical argument without apparent sarcasm.

7. the overall message seems to be a mix of initial sarcasm followed by a genuine opinion.

given that the text contains clear elements of sarcasm, especially in the first half, even though it transitions to a more serious tone, the appropriate classification would be:

2. the comment starts by stating facts about how the genocide began, with listing tutsis.

3. the second sentence takes a dark turn, using euphemism (""took them off of the lists"") for killing.

4. the use of ""....permanently"" adds a grim emphasis.

5. the addition of ""emoticon_wow"" at the end is jarring and inappropriate given the subject matter.

6. the contrast between the horrific content and the casual ""emoticon_wow"" suggests dark humor.

7. this inappropriate juxtaposition of a serious topic with a light-hearted expression is a hallmark of sarcasm.

5. the tone throughout is critical and implies distrust in the information being presented.
6. while the language is confrontational, it doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or irony.

1. the tone of the response seems exaggerated and overly enthusiastic.
2. the writer claims there's ""only one problem"" but then calls it ""a big one,"" which seems contradictory.
3. the phrase ""i'll fix it!"" suggests a mocking tone.
4. the ""correction"" provided doesn't actually change or fix anything substantial.
5. the exclamation ""there! it looks correct now!"" seems overly triumphant for such a minor, arguably non-existent change.

1. the comment starts with ""oh, i don't know about that,"" which often indicates disagreement or skepticism.

2. the person mentions ""march of the penguins"" as a successful and award-winning documentary.

3. they then contrast this with michael moore's movies, suggesting that calling moore's work ""documentaries"" requires ""artistic license"" and ""slight of hand.""

"And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was ""I do not believe in a personal god"", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the statement is about stephen hawking's beliefs.
2. it claims that the ""only thing"" hawking said about god was a specific quote.

5. this interpretation seems to be an oversimplification of hawking's views.
6. hawking was known to have expressed more complex thoughts on the subject of god and the universe.
7. the phrase ""at best"" suggests a dismissive attitude towards these beliefs.
8. the statement appears to be making a reductive argument about a complex topic.

"Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. the statement begins with ""well, yeah,"" which often indicates a sarcastic tone.

2. the phrase ""all we can do is shrug"" suggests a dismissive or exaggerated attitude.

2. however, the rest of the sentence contradicts this expectation: ""this is probably the most enlightened response i can expect from this crowd.""

3. the use of ""enlightened"" here is likely not literal, but rather ironic. the speaker seems to be implying that the response is actually not enlightened at all.

4. the phrase ""from this crowd"" suggests a negative opinion of the group being referred to.

5. the overall tone is one of disappointment and criticism, masked by seemingly positive language.

"Nonsense. Name the holes and what parts are conjecture? The parts that are conjecture are never, ever taught in a high school biology class. There isn't time. Only major points are covered about which there is no doubt.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the text is assertive and defensive, starting with ""nonsense.""

2. the author is challenging someone to ""name the holes and what parts are conjecture?""

3. they claim that conjectural parts of biology are ""never, ever taught in a high school biology class.""

4. they emphasize the lack of time in high school classes, stating ""there isn't time.""

5. the final statement, ""only major points are covered about which there is no doubt,"" is presented as an absolute fact.

6. the overall tone seems exaggerated and overly confident, using words like ""never, ever"" and making sweeping generalizations.

7. this level of absolutism is often a hallmark of sarcasm, used to mock opposing viewpoints.

1. the text begins with a rhetorical question, challenging the logic of equating long publications with panic attacks.

2. the author then makes a comparison between reading posts and watching a film called ""expelled,"" pointing out the time difference.

3. the question ""does that mean that iders are having the mother of all panic attacks?"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally. it's using exaggeration to mock the initial premise.

1. the question is posed in a challenging, provocative manner.
2. it presents a controversial topic (abortion) with a seemingly dismissive tone towards fetal pain.
3. the follow-up question implies that even if the fetus could feel pain, it shouldn't necessarily be prioritized over the mother's pain.
4. the phrasing suggests the author is not genuinely seeking an answer, but rather making a point.
5. the tone appears to mock or criticize those who prioritize fetal pain in abortion debates.
6. the use of rhetorical questions is often associated with sarcasm.

1. the tone starts off serious and straightforward: ""i don't understand your question.""

2. the next sentence expresses a hypothetical situation that the speaker would approve of, but it's clear they don't believe this is the case.

3. the phrase ""as far as i can see"" introduces the speaker's actual view of the situation.

4. the description of ""the gunners"" and their supposed goals is exaggerated and critical: ""to make sure that everyone has a gun, no matter how insane, no matter how stupid...""

5. the use of extreme terms like ""everyone,"" ""insane,"" and ""stupid"" indicates hyperbole.

"But you're missing one important fact.
 NONE of those ""reasons"" are required for marriage.
 Absolutely none of them. Any combination of man/woman can marry for whatever reason they want. Even if it's just drunken fun.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the text seems frustrated or exasperated, indicated by the use of capitalization (""none"") for emphasis.

2. the author is countering an argument not explicitly stated in the given text, suggesting they're responding to someone else's reasons for marriage.

3. the statement ""absolutely none of them"" reinforces the point strongly, showing irritation with the previous argument.

4. the phrase ""any combination of man/woman can marry for whatever reason they want"" suggests the author is advocating for a more open view of marriage.

5. the final sentence, ""even if it's just drunken fun,"" is an extreme example used to prove the point. this hyperbole is often a characteristic of sarcastic statements.

6. however, while the tone is frustrated and the example is extreme, the overall message seems to be sincere rather than sarcastic. the author appears to be making a genuine argument against restrictive views of marriage.

"But poetry will never be taken seriously in political decisions. Atheists have a lot to like in songofgenesis, don't they?   another quote",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the first sentence seems to be a straightforward statement about poetry's lack of influence in politics.

2. the second sentence abruptly shifts to atheists and ""songofgenesis,"" which is likely referring to the biblical creation story.

3. the juxtaposition of atheists and genesis is inherently contradictory, as atheists typically reject religious creation stories.

4. the phrase ""have a lot to like"" when referring to atheists and genesis is clearly not meant to be taken literally, as it's highly unlikely that atheists would genuinely appreciate the genesis creation story.

5. the final ""another quote"" seems out of place and adds to the overall disjointed nature of the text.

6. the combination of contradictory ideas and the unlikely pairing of atheists appreciating genesis strongly suggests that this statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

7. the overall tone seems to be mocking or criticizing the lack of prompt defense for the flood theory.

given these points, the text appears to be using subtle mockery and criticism, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.

The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).",0,not sarcastic,0

"So what if the author isn't arguing against gun control? At last, there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime.",0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the tone starts with ""so what if..."" which often indicates a dismissive or confrontational attitude.

2. the phrase ""at last"" suggests the speaker thinks this realization was long overdue, implying previous frustration.

3. the statement about england ""taking a step in the right direction"" seems to praise a change in policy.

5. the conclusion that this isn't ""the answer to crime"" oversimplifies a complex issue.

6. the overall tone seems to mock the idea that stricter gun control is always the solution, using exaggeration and oversimplification.

given these observations, the statement appears to be using irony to criticize gun control policies, rather than sincerely praising a policy change.

"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological.

The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone.

More people actuallysupport the FSM school of creationsim - would you agree that this could be a suitable compromise?,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, we need to understand what fsm stands for in this context. it likely refers to the ""flying spaghetti monster,"" a satirical deity invented to criticize the teaching of creationism in schools.

2. the question asks if this could be a ""suitable compromise,"" implying a serious consideration of the flying spaghetti monster as a legitimate alternative to other creation theories.

3. the idea of the flying spaghetti monster being taught in schools or considered a serious compromise is absurd, which is the point of the satire.

4. the phrasing ""more people actually support"" adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's presenting a ridiculous idea as if it were factual and widely accepted.

5. the use of ""creationsim"" (likely a misspelling of ""creationism"") in conjunction with fsm further emphasizes the satirical nature of the statement.

given these points, the statement is clearly not meant to be taken seriously and is using irony to make a point about creationism in schools.

But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits.

 Good God! No wonder you don't like guns and want to see everyone disarmed!",0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the comment is exaggerated and dramatic.
2. it uses rhetorical questions and exclamations to emphasize a point.
3. the comment implies an extreme interpretation of someone's stance on gun control.
4. it makes a leap in logic, connecting disliking guns to wanting to inflict pain on innocent people.
5. the exaggeration and absurd connection suggest the commenter isn't being sincere.
6. the phrase ""good god!"" adds to the overblown reaction.
7. the final statement about disarming everyone is likely not meant to be taken literally.

given these observations, the comment appears to be using hyperbole and absurd logic to mock an opposing viewpoint on gun control. this is a classic sarcastic approach.

 the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the first part of the input is asking questions about noah's ark, a biblical story.

2. the second part acknowledges that the story doesn't align with modern scientific understanding.

3. however, the text then states that the story does work within the context of genesis, and provides a specific biblical reference.

"Well, yes, the idea of an omnipotent being with a definable physical (or even mental) form has always struck me as a little... odd.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. tone analysis: the text begins with ""well, yes,"" which often indicates a somewhat hesitant or thoughtful agreement.

2. content: the speaker is discussing the concept of an omnipotent being (typically referring to a god or deity) having a definable form.

3. word choice: the use of ""odd"" at the end is understated, given the magnitude of the concept being discussed.

4. context: discussing religious or philosophical concepts often invites nuanced or indirect commentary.

5. subtlety: the speaker isn't outright mocking the idea, but rather expressing a mild skepticism through understatement.

6. implication: by calling the idea ""a little... odd,"" the speaker is likely implying it's actually quite absurd, which is a common sarcastic technique.

given these factors, especially the understatement and implied criticism, this statement appears to be using gentle sarcasm to express skepticism about religious concepts.

"But she murdered her child.
 
 There are laws in Austrailia (and hopefully someday in the U.S.) against killing your pre-birth children.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. first, we need to consider the context and tone of the statement.

2. the first sentence ""but she murdered her child."" is a straightforward, serious statement about a grave crime.

3. the second sentence refers to laws against ""killing your pre-birth children,"" which is an unusual way to describe abortion.

4. the use of the term ""pre-birth children"" instead of ""fetuses"" or ""unborn babies"" is somewhat unconventional and could be seen as an attempt to equate abortion with child murder.

5. the parenthetical reference to ""hopefully someday in the u.s."" suggests a political stance on abortion laws.

6. while the overall topic is serious, the phrasing and comparison between abortion and child murder could be seen as an exaggerated or provocative way to make a point about abortion laws.

7. however, there's no clear indicator of irony or humor that would typically accompany sarcasm.

8. the statement seems to be a sincere, albeit controversial, opinion rather than a sarcastic comment.

given this analysis, the most appropriate classification is:

1. the statement begins with ""that's true, but..."" which often indicates a counterargument or skepticism.

2. the question raised challenges the extent of actual learning versus theorizing.

3. the phrase ""with an atheist presupposition"" suggests a critique of a particular worldview.

4. ""the only presupposition currently allowed"" implies a restriction on alternative viewpoints.

5. the overall tone seems to question the validity or completeness of current scientific understanding.

6. the phrasing appears to be subtly mocking or criticizing the limitations of a purely atheistic approach to knowledge.

7. while not overtly humorous, there's an underlying criticism conveyed through a seemingly innocent question.

given these observations, the statement appears to be using subtle mockery to criticize a particular approach to knowledge, which is a form of sarcasm.

"This is just plain dumb. Abortion is NOT the primary means of birth control. If it is used as birth control, it's because others have failed or haven't been tried.",0,"step 1: analyze the tone and content of the statement.
- the opening phrase ""this is just plain dumb"" indicates frustration or disagreement.
- the text appears to be refuting a claim about abortion being used as primary birth control.

step 2: examine the use of capitalization and emphasis.
- ""not"" is capitalized for emphasis, suggesting strong disagreement with the idea being discussed.

step 3: consider the logical argument presented.
- the statement provides a counter-argument about when abortion might be used, implying other methods would be tried first.

step 4: assess for sarcastic elements.
- there's no obvious reversal of meaning or exaggeration typical of sarcasm.
- the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit passionate, expression of opinion.

step 5: conclude based on analysis.
- the text seems to be a genuine expression of disagreement rather than a sarcastic comment.

"Actually, scientists who discard the global flood are taken seriously.",0,"1. first, let's consider the context and tone of this statement:
   - it starts with ""actually,"" which often indicates a correction or contradiction.
   - it mentions ""scientists"" and ""global flood,"" suggesting a scientific/religious debate.

2. the phrase ""are taken seriously"" is key here:
   - in a straightforward statement, this would be unremarkable.
   - however, in the context of creationism vs. scientific consensus, this is likely not sincere.

3. the implication seems to be:
   - scientists who accept mainstream geological evidence are being dismissed.
   - this is contrary to reality, where the global flood theory is not accepted in mainstream science.

4. the sarcasm lies in stating the opposite of what is generally true:
   - scientists who accept geological evidence are actually the ones taken seriously.
   - the statement sarcastically implies the reverse.

5. conclusion:
   given the context and the implied meaning opposite to the literal words, this statement is likely sarcastic.

"Well, really, they both compensate and reciprocate for one another, you could say.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. first, we need to analyze the structure and tone of the sentence.
2. the phrase ""well, really"" at the beginning often indicates a sarcastic or ironic tone.
3. the use of formal or overly complex language (""compensate and reciprocate"") for a seemingly simple concept can be a sign of sarcasm.
4. the phrase ""you could say"" at the end adds a layer of ambiguity or uncertainty, which is sometimes used in sarcastic statements.
5. however, without more context, it's difficult to be absolutely certain if this is genuine explanation or sarcasm.
6. given the combination of the opening phrase, the formal language, and the closing phrase, it leans more towards sarcasm than a straightforward statement.

based on this analysis, the most likely classification is:

"Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. tone analysis: the text appears to be a serious discussion about marriage, including multi-partner and same-sex marriages. there's no apparent irony or mockery in the tone.

2. content examination: the author presents various viewpoints on marriage, discussing cultural differences, human nature, and the complexities of relationships.

3. language use: the language is straightforward and analytical, without exaggeration or humor typically associated with sarcasm.

4. context: the text seems to be part of a broader discussion on marriage, presenting balanced arguments rather than making sarcastic comments.

"very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause",0,not sarcastic,0
"See the above critique. Of course, this also is underestimating the power of natural selection and random varition, and includes the logical fallacy of personal incredibiltiy.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text begins with ""see the above critique,"" suggesting it's responding to a previous statement.

2. the phrase ""of course"" is often used sarcastically to introduce a contradictory or critical point.

3. the author then mentions ""underestimating the power of natural selection and random variation,"" which implies they disagree with the previous critique.

4. the text ends by pointing out a ""logical fallacy of personal incredibility,"" which is a direct criticism of the argument being referenced.

5. the tone is academic and critical, using terms like ""logical fallacy"" and ""natural selection,"" but the underlying message is dismissive of the argument it's addressing.

6. the combination of the seemingly agreeable ""of course"" with the subsequent criticism is a common sarcastic structure.

given these points, especially the use of ""of course"" followed by criticism, and the overall dismissive tone, this text appears to be using sarcasm to critique another argument.

"But we certainly have the right to evict such persons.   But then, regardless, the embryo is not a person.",0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the statement consists of two parts that seem contradictory.
2. the first part talks about having the right to evict ""such persons.""
3. the second part then states that ""the embryo is not a person.""
4. this creates a logical inconsistency - if the embryo isn't a person, why mention evicting ""persons"" in the first place?
5. the contradiction between these two statements suggests the speaker is not being entirely serious.
6. the use of ""but then, regardless"" further emphasizes the dismissive tone.
7. the overall effect is to mock or ridicule arguments about embryo rights by presenting conflicting viewpoints.

given this analysis, the statement appears to be using irony to make a point, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

It's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way.,0,"1. let's break down the sentence:
   ""it's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way.""

2. consider the structure:
   - it starts with a negative statement
   - followed by a conditional clause that contradicts the first part

3. analyze the meaning:
   - the speaker is saying something isn't literal
   - but then suggests it could be literal if interpreted that way
   - this creates a paradoxical or circular logic

4. evaluate the tone:
   - the statement seems to be playing with the concept of interpretation
   - it's making a point about subjectivity in a clever, roundabout way

5. consider the context:
   - without more context, this statement appears to be making a subtle joke about interpretation and meaning

6. conclusion:
   - the statement uses contradiction and wordplay in a way that's typical of sarcastic remarks
   - it's not straightforward, but rather uses irony to make a point

"And with the possible exception of collecting, Australian licensing laws allow all of the above. I should know I have lived and shot over there.

That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present. I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person (now merely a cell) to die.",0,not sarcastic,0

3. the tone is confrontational and accusatory.
4. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end contrasts sharply with the serious subject matter.

"If that's the criteria, then it must be Islam and Roman Catholicism in the Final Days.
Of course, the Mormons are mightily proselytizing away. They might make a billion yet.",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the first sentence seems to be referring to some criteria for something, possibly related to religion or population growth.

2. the mention of ""final days"" could be referencing religious apocalyptic beliefs, but it's used in a matter-of-fact tone.

2. the tone suggests that neither of these sources would be considered reliable or appropriate for their respective topics.

3. the phrase ""it's as much of a point that phillp johnson has"" implies that the speaker doesn't think johnson's point is valid or substantial.

"Welcome to the world of fundamentalism ! You mean you still don't know -they have no use for logic, common sense , hence they use all these absurd comparisons. The debate is going to go around in circles.

1. the text begins with ""welcome to the world of fundamentalism!"" this exclamation seems exaggerated and not genuinely welcoming.

2. the phrase ""you mean you still don't know"" implies frustration or mockery towards someone's lack of understanding.

You'll never have that problem comic relief. You'll always be young mentally.,1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the phrase ""you'll never have that problem"" typically sets up an expectation of a compliment or reassurance.

2. however, it's followed by ""comic relief,"" which is often used to describe a character or situation that provides humor in an otherwise serious context.

3. the next sentence, ""you'll always be young mentally,"" could be interpreted two ways:
   a) as a genuine compliment about someone's youthful spirit
   b) as an implication that the person is immature or childish

4. given the setup with ""comic relief"" and the potential double meaning of ""young mentally,"" this appears to be a subtle jab rather than a sincere compliment.

5. the contrast between the seemingly positive statements and their potentially negative implications is a hallmark of sarcasm.

6. the overall tone suggests the speaker is not being straightforward, but rather using irony to make a point.

based on this analysis, the label that best fits is:

"If your to blind to see, me telling you won't help.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. first, let's examine the language and tone:
   - the phrase ""if your to blind to see"" is intentionally using incorrect grammar (""your"" instead of ""you're"").
   - the statement implies that the person being addressed is metaphorically ""blind"" or unable to understand something obvious.

2. consider the context and implication:
   - the speaker suggests that explaining won't help, implying that the other person is too dense or unwilling to understand.
   - this is a dismissive and somewhat condescending way to respond to someone.

3. analyze the overall message:
   - the statement is not meant to be taken literally. it's using the idea of blindness metaphorically to criticize someone's lack of understanding or perception.
   - the tone is mocking and not straightforward or helpful.

4. look for sarcasm indicators:
   - the use of exaggeration (comparing lack of understanding to blindness)
   - the contradictory nature of the statement (pointing out blindness while saying explaining won't help)
   - the implied criticism and mockery

5. conclusion:
   - given the mocking tone, the intentional use of poor grammar, and the contradictory nature of the statement, this appears to be a sarcastic comment.

2. it then mentions ""center for the working poor"", which appears to be the name of an organization.

3. the next line, ""which is tada!!!! the burning bush!!!!"" is where the potential sarcasm lies.

4. the use of ""tada!!!!"" suggests an exaggerated, theatrical reveal.

5. equating ""center for the working poor"" with ""the burning bush"" (a biblical reference) seems intentionally overblown and unlikely to be sincere.

6. the excessive use of exclamation marks also hints at exaggeration or mockery.

7. this dramatic reveal and equation of a work-related organization with a religious symbol is likely meant to be humorous or mocking, rather than sincere.

given these observations, the text appears to be using exaggeration and unexpected comparisons for comedic effect, which are common elements of sarcasm.

3. look for irony: there's no obvious irony here; the speaker seems to be making a straightforward request.

4. examine word choice: ""theatrical flair"" is a somewhat dramatic way to describe someone else's behavior, which could be seen as slightly ironic.

5. overall intent: the speaker appears to be genuinely asking for less dramatic behavior in the future, rather than making a sarcastic comment.

6. final assessment: while there's a slight hint of irony in the phrasing, it doesn't seem strong enough to classify this as sarcasm.

"Yeah, your potential spouse will like you for your personality after you meet the prerequisite of being the proper gender for them.",1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. analyze the statement's literal meaning:
   the statement suggests that personality matters in attracting a potential spouse, but only after meeting a gender requirement.

2. consider the implied meaning:
   the statement implies that physical attributes or gender are more important than personality in attracting a partner.

3. look for contradictions or absurdity:
   there's a contradiction between the importance of personality and the emphasis on gender as a ""prerequisite.""

4. assess the tone:
   the tone is cynical and mocking, particularly with the use of ""yeah"" at the beginning and the phrase ""proper gender.""

5. evaluate social commentary:
   the statement seems to be criticizing shallow dating practices or societal expectations in relationships.

6. check for exaggeration:
   the use of ""prerequisite"" for gender preference exaggerates typical dating dynamics.

7. final judgment:
   the statement uses irony to criticize superficial aspects of dating, contradicting the common advice that personality is most important.

2. consider the context: the phrase ""at last"" implies frustration or long waiting, which contrasts with the apparent enthusiasm.

3. examine the contrast: the speaker is juxtaposing ""evolution"" with ""mythology,"" implying that previous discussions were not scientific.

2. the second line is a rhetorical question, which is another common sarcastic device. it's asking for evidence in a way that suggests the person doesn't actually expect an answer.

"Better still , you pop down to your local army barracks and explain it to thememoticonXClown",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the phrase ""pop down to your local army barracks"" is casual and doesn't fit with the serious nature of military establishments.

2. the suggestion to ""explain it to them"" at an army barracks implies that the military would be interested in or capable of addressing a presumably non-military issue, which is unlikely.

3. the use of ""emoticon"" and ""clown"" at the end is odd and doesn't fit with the rest of the sentence, suggesting a mocking or dismissive tone.

4. the overall tone is dismissive and suggests an absurd course of action, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

5. the incongruity between the casual suggestion and the serious setting (army barracks) further supports a sarcastic interpretation.

given these observations, the statement appears to be intentionally ridiculous and not meant to be taken seriously.

"Isn't that morality?

One iota of actuality is worth a millionfold of your ""innateness.""",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the tone is dismissive and aggressive, questioning the concept of ""innateness"" with strong language.

2. the phrase ""who gives a flying fark"" is a colloquial and somewhat vulgar way of expressing strong disinterest or contempt.

3. the last sentence uses exaggeration to emphasize the perceived worthlessness of ""innateness"" compared to ""actuality.""

4. the repetition of ""innateness"" in quotation marks suggests the speaker is mocking or belittling the concept.

5. the overall message seems to be conveying frustration or irritation with a philosophical or ethical discussion about innate morality.

6. while the language is strong and critical, it doesn't appear to be saying the opposite of what it means, which is a key component of sarcasm.

considering these points, the text seems to be expressing genuine frustration rather than using sarcasm to make its point.

1. tone: the overall tone is confrontational and dismissive.

2. language: phrases like ""of course"" and ""you know as well as"" are often used sarcastically to imply the opposite.

For instance, you might say ""Resolved: Creation and Evolution are equally valid interpretations of empirical evidence"".

Or, perhaps it's the age of the earth you want to focus on: ""Resolved: all available evidence is consistent with a 6-10,000 year old earth""   I can't do this for you, feindslayer; make up your mind and present a proper challenge.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

I think we should not only allow GAYs to have legal marriage rights but also those who want to practice insist as well as all who want to practice polygamy. Let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals. After all I love my Dog and my Parrot. Why stop with GAYs?   By the way where does the term GAY come from for homosexuals.,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

Wow. I didn't know refuting an analysis was possible by religiously adhering to the concepts you are trying to prove nonexistant.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

It's no surprise, though; it's all you have, Archie. You come in here making assertions about souls, so when we challenge you to defend your view... you don't. emoticonXRolleyes",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

"On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem...",1,"1. let's break down the statement:
   - ""on the bright side"" is often used sarcastically to introduce a negative situation.
   - the statement refers to the ""rapture,"" a religious concept of the end times.
   - it suggests the rapture would solve social security financing issues.

2. consider the implications:

   - solving social security issues through mass disappearance is a dark and cynical idea.

3. analyze the tone:
   - the statement presents a catastrophic event as a solution to a financial problem.
   - this juxtaposition of a serious religious concept with a mundane financial issue creates irony.

4. evaluate the intent:
   - the speaker is likely not seriously suggesting the rapture as a solution.
   - they are using dark humor to comment on both religious beliefs and financial issues.

5. conclusion:
   - the statement uses irony and dark humor to make a point.
   - it's not meant to be taken literally.

2. the ""(heh,heh,)"" is typically used to indicate laughter or amusement, often in a mocking or sarcastic way.

3. ""no, we didn't (thank goodness)"" appears to be expressing relief about something not happening, but the tone seems exaggerated.

4. the use of ""and!"" with an exclamation mark adds emphasis in a way that could be interpreted as mock excitement.

2. the speaker then says, ""i provided evidence to support my assertion."" this suggests they've made an effort to prove their point.

3. the next part, ""you provided ............"" implies that the other person didn't provide much, if anything, in response.

4. the final part, ""oh no it isn't!"" is in quotes, suggesting it's mimicking the other person's response. this short, dismissive reply contrasts sharply with the speaker's claim of providing evidence.

5. the overall tone implies frustration with someone who refuses to acknowledge evidence and responds with a childish denial.

   - the use of ""lol"" at the end suggests the speaker finds amusement in their own insults.

4. sarcasm indicators:
   - the exaggerated stereotyping (buck teeth, banjo)

1. the comment starts with ""yeah, those teabaggers are sooo racist. :)""
   - the exaggerated ""sooo"" and the smiley face "":)"" are often indicators of sarcasm.
   - ""teabaggers"" is a derogatory term for tea party members, suggesting the commenter doesn't actually agree with the statement.

2. the next line mentions ""black tea party activists called 'traitors'""
   - this contradicts the idea that tea party members are inherently racist.

3. the commenter then says ""you're just as bad as marieantoinette, anyone who disagrees with obama is racist.""
   - this is clearly meant to mock the idea that disagreeing with obama automatically makes someone racist.

4. the final statements express support for people thinking for themselves, regardless of the president's race.

5. the overall tone is mocking those who label tea party members or obama critics as racist.

"So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the statement begins with ""so atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy..."" this part acknowledges positive attributes of atheists.

2. however, it then adds ""...but they have no meaning unless one conforms to the fundamentalist christian morality.""

3. this second part contradicts the first, implying that despite these positive qualities, they are meaningless without christian morality.

4. the contrast between acknowledging positive atheist qualities and then dismissing them is indicative of sarcasm.

5. the use of ""fundamentalist christian morality"" as the sole source of meaning for these qualities is likely an exaggeration to make a point.

2. consider the tone:
   - the phrase ""i guess he changed his mind, once again"" implies a sense of exasperation or frustration.
   - the contrast between a bunny suit and ""this suit"" is quite stark, which could be intended for comedic effect.

3. look for indicators of sarcasm:
   - the use of ""once again"" suggests a pattern of indecisiveness, which could be an exaggeration for sarcastic effect.
   - the casual way of describing a potentially significant change (from bunny suit to another suit) could be seen as understating the situation, a common sarcastic technique.

4. evaluate the context:
   - without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a genuine observation or a sarcastic comment.
   - however, the combination of exasperation, stark contrast, and casual tone leans towards sarcasm.

5. make a decision:
   - given the analysis, this statement appears to have sarcastic elements.

   - the text uses phrases like ""rambles on,"" ""irrational hate speech,"" and ""paranoid hate mongers.""
   - these are clearly negative and critical.

2. consider the context:
   - the writer is responding to someone else's post.
   - they're criticizing the other person's argumentative style and accusations.

3. look for sarcastic elements:

1. the text starts with ""why?"", suggesting a questioning or challenging tone.

2. the following questions about reading chinese and ancient mayan seem to be rhetorical, not seeking genuine answers.

"Wow, Archie actually admits that angels do have free will. That makes a change.
But then he goes and spoils it again by saying that they don't really have free will, but describes grace instead. He has a habit of redefining stuff.
And I thought he was actually going to admit his mistake. Silly me.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the text is critical and mocking.

6. the use of ""wow"" at the beginning and ""silly me"" at the end are classic sarcastic phrases.
7. the overall message is conveying frustration and disagreement through irony.

given these observations, the text is clearly using sarcasm to criticize someone's inconsistent arguments.

"Walking-fish:
Yeh, but God is not a biologist. How would He know?",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the comment is in response to something about a ""walking-fish,"" likely referring to evolutionary biology.

2. the phrase ""yeh, but"" indicates a contradictory or skeptical tone.

3. the statement ""god is not a biologist"" is not meant to be taken literally, as it personifies god and assigns him a professional limitation.

5. the overall tone is mocking the idea that god's creation conflicts with scientific understanding of evolution.

6. the comment uses irony by suggesting limitations to an supposedly all-knowing deity.

given these points, the comment is clearly using irony to make a point, which is a key characteristic of sarcasm.

"................................
My God - what was I thinking getting off welfare, busting my XXX for that degree and getting a job that pays more 7 times what I got the few months used welfare?! emoticonXRolleyes
[/quote]",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the comment is exaggerated and dramatic, starting with ""my god - what was i thinking...""

2. the speaker is listing positive achievements (getting off welfare, earning a degree, getting a well-paying job) but framing them as if they were mistakes.

3. the use of ""busting my xxx"" suggests frustration, but it's directed at their own efforts to improve their life.

4. the comment ends with ""emoticonxrolleyes"", indicating an eye-rolling emoticon, which is often used to express exasperation or sarcasm.

5. the overall message contradicts common sense - no one would genuinely regret improving their financial situation so dramatically.

6. the rhetorical question format further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

given these observations, the speaker is clearly not sincerely regretting their life improvements. they are using sarcasm to emphasize how beneficial these changes have been, likely in response to criticism of welfare-to-work programs or similar initiatives.

So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.,1,sarcastic,1
"Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right.",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

"You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy ""holding the fort"" against the hordes of starving yuppies.",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the tone starts off seemingly serious: ""you know i actually considered that.""

2. but then it quickly shifts: ""too much work, though. i have added to my list of things to do when i retire.""

3. the mention of ""hordes of starving yuppies"" is clearly an exaggeration and not meant to be taken literally.

4. the phrase ""holding the fort"" in this context is used humorously.

5. the overall message is conveying a sense of mock concern about a future scenario that's intentionally absurd.

"So you deny that this man is a victim? Realize that the gunshot drew attention, and attention is something criminals don't want. Maybe without that gunshot, the guy would've been beaten to death. But I suppose you'd be happier, because at least the old man wasn't a gun owner. Or I suppose you think he should've let the criminal have the money; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.",1,sarcastic,1

"I love to go to the playground and watch the children jumping up and down. They don't know I'm firing blanks.""",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the first sentence seems innocent: ""i love to go to the playground and watch the children jumping up and down.""

2. however, the second sentence takes a dark turn: ""they don't know i'm firing blanks.""

3. ""firing blanks"" is a euphemism for being infertile or unable to have children.

4. the juxtaposition of watching children play with the revelation of infertility creates a stark contrast.

5. this contrast is unexpected and creates a bitter or sardonic tone.

6. the speaker is using this contrast to express a complex emotion, likely disappointment or frustration, in an indirect way.

7. this indirect expression of negative emotions through seemingly positive statements is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given these elements, particularly the exaggeration, irony, and playful tone, this text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm.
