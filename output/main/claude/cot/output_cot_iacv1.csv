That sentence doesn't even make sense. Did it occur to you that you should actually think about what you are going to say and express actual ideas?,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. tone: the tone is critical and confrontational, which can be indicative of sarcasm.

2. exaggeration: the phrase ""doesn't even make sense"" is a strong statement that could be hyperbolic.

3. rhetorical question: ""did it occur to you..."" is a rhetorical question, often used in sarcastic comments.

4. implication: the comment implies the speaker didn't think or express actual ideas, which is likely an exaggeration.

5. context: without broader context, this could be genuine criticism, but the phrasing suggests mockery.

6. intent: the intent seems to be to belittle or mock the person being addressed, rather than provide constructive criticism.

given these factors, particularly the confrontational tone, rhetorical question, and implied mockery, this statement is likely meant to be sarcastic rather than a genuine inquiry or criticism.

"Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.   In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.   BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

You stand up for women..   I stand up for the child who has no choice   Who's being descrimatory here?,0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the text seems to be presenting a contrast between two positions.
2. the first position is ""standing up for women.""
3. the second position is ""standing up for the child who has no choice.""
4. the question at the end implies that one of these positions is discriminatory.
5. the structure and tone suggest that the speaker believes their position (standing up for the child) is morally superior.
6. the question ""who's being descrimatory here?"" is likely rhetorical, implying that those who stand up for women are actually being discriminatory.
7. this reversal of expectations (accusing those who claim to fight discrimination of being discriminatory themselves) is a common sarcastic technique.
8. the misspelling of ""discriminatory"" as ""descrimatory"" could be intentional to add to the sarcastic tone.

given these observations, the text appears to be using sarcasm to make a point.

"But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution, which is based on lies and deceptions, they prove right there that they haven't enough knowledge of the truth, nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie.

I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.

"The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern.

That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none.

"No. You're missing the point. Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.   Al Gore is a shyster...just like Michael Moore. Documentary, my XXX!   Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before. Think it could be resulting from their industrial age?   ...and he's pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do. Check the stats on his personal home. Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.   He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly, yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California.   We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills). This fact does not diminish the lies told by Al Gore...the ones that got him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, both of which become more meaningless each year.   Gore, a shyster   http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sh...d-return-oscar   http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php?extend.29   1.	The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming. The Government's expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.   2.	The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was “not possible?to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.	The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.   5.	The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.   11.	The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand. The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.

3. content: the text presents numerous counter-arguments to gore's claims, attempting to debunk them point by point.

4. intent: the author seems to be trying to discredit gore and the concept of human-caused climate change.

5. context: the text is written in a way that mocks and ridicules gore's position, using exaggeration and rhetorical questions.

6. overall effect: the text is clearly meant to be a scathing criticism of gore and climate change activism, using sarcasm and ridicule as tools.

"Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.   Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours. I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate: ""Because you don't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded.""",0,not sarcastic,0
What other theories? Why mention them if you aren't going to explain them? You are actually on a board of education? I notice there was no mention of telling kids that there are other theories of gravity and that all of them have holes. Evolution is a more secure theory than gravity.,0,sarcastic,1
"This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.   Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark.",0,not sarcastic,0

After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.",0,not sarcastic,0
"You are getting to a more complicated area where ""mental existence"" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as ""self defense"" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before.",0,not sarcastic,0
"oh, now we're getting somewhere. Explain more, please. Oh, and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the text seems exasperated or frustrated.
2. the phrase ""oh, now we're getting somewhere"" is often used sarcastically when little progress is actually being made.
3. the request for ""more explanation"" and ""evidence of incremental modifications"" suggests the speaker is not satisfied with what they've been presented so far.
4. the ""oh, and..."" addition at the end feels like a sarcastic afterthought, implying that basic evidence hasn't even been provided yet.
5. the overall context suggests that the speaker is criticizing a lack of progress or thoroughness in some explanation or process.

given these observations, the text appears to be using sarcasm to express dissatisfaction or criticism.

"Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the statement begins with ""yes it is,"" which seems to be agreeing with a previous point.

2. the content that follows is actually stating a factual legal position about police obligations in the us.

3. the information provided about police not being constitutionally obligated to protect individual citizens is accurate.

4. the explanation about potential lawsuits if police were obligated to protect every individual is logical and presented in a straightforward manner.

5. there's no obvious exaggeration, irony, or humorous twist that would typically indicate sarcasm.

6. the tone is matter-of-fact and informative rather than mocking or contradictory.

7. the statement aims to explain a legal reality rather than make a joke or criticize indirectly.

given these observations, the statement appears to be a genuine explanation of a legal concept without any sarcastic intent.

"I got an interesting tid bit for you:   http://www.2ampd.net/Articles/difiElitist.htm   First read the text. The anti-gun senator is noted for having the ONLY legal concealed gun in the city of San Francisco.   Also note as a person who carried a concealed gun and still keeps a .357 magnum for protection, that she should KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER, until your aming at your target.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text appears to be sharing information about a senator who is anti-gun but has a concealed carry permit.

2. the author points out an apparent hypocrisy: the senator is against guns for others but has one herself.

3. the tone is critical and seems to be pointing out this inconsistency.

4. the last sentence about keeping your finger off the trigger until aiming at a target doesn't seem sarcastic, but rather a genuine gun safety tip.

5. while there's criticism and perhaps some irony in pointing out the senator's stance versus her actions, the overall tone doesn't appear to be using sarcasm as a rhetorical device.

6. the text seems more informative and critical rather than employing sarcasm to make its point.

based on this analysis, the text doesn't appear to be using sarcasm as its primary mode of communication.

"They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost. If you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya gotta do is inject miracles into the field. ",0,"1. the text starts with a serious tone, explaining a viewpoint about rejecting a concept.

2. the phrase ""i mean come on"" introduces a shift in tone, suggesting sarcasm might follow.

3. the author then asks a rhetorical question about the utility of physics incorporating miracles, implying it would be useless.

4. the statement ""nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost"" exaggerates the consequences, a common sarcastic technique.

5. the final sentence about injecting miracles into science to make it arbitrary and unreliable is clearly hyperbolic and mocking.

6. the use of casual language like ""ya gotta"" in the context of discussing scientific principles further suggests a sarcastic tone.

given these observations, the text appears to be using sarcasm to criticize the idea of incorporating non-scientific concepts into science.

"Some apply logic, some do not. So much for contradictory thinking.   What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind? Hold the mythology, please.   from infidels.org -   The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ""the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference."" Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.   It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.   Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text begins with a statement that seems to criticize inconsistent thinking: ""some apply logic, some do not. so much for contradictory thinking.""

2. the author then asks a challenging question: ""what evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind?""

3. the rest of the text provides a definition of logic and discusses its nature and limitations.

4. the tone is serious and informative, presenting factual information about logic and its place in human reasoning.

5. there's no obvious exaggeration, irony, or humor that would indicate sarcasm.

6. the content appears to be a genuine discussion about the nature of logic, its definition, and its limitations.

7. the text seems to be part of a larger, serious discussion or debate, likely from an educational or philosophical context (as indicated by the mention of infidels.org).

given these observations, the text does not appear to contain sarcasm. it's a straightforward, informative piece about logic.

"Didn't supersport openly admit he could not prove his own beliefs in divine creation?   For all his dishonesty, you have to admit he's more honest and forthcoming then Marc or AA have been.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text mentions ""supersport"" admitting he couldn't prove his beliefs in divine creation. this seems to be a serious statement, not sarcastic.

2. the phrase ""for all his dishonesty"" is used, which appears to be a genuine criticism.

3. however, this is immediately followed by ""you have to admit he's more honest and forthcoming"". this is a contradictory statement - calling someone dishonest and then more honest in the same sentence.

4. the comparison to ""marc or aa"" suggests this is part of a larger discussion or debate.

5. the contradiction between ""dishonesty"" and ""more honest"" is likely intentional, used to highlight perceived hypocrisy or inconsistency.

6. this kind of intentional contradiction is a common sarcastic technique, used to mock or criticize.

given these points, especially the contradictory nature of the statement about honesty, this appears to be a sarcastic comment.

It has just as much feeling as the mother.",0,sarcastic,1
"Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the statement is about the death penalty and appeals process.
2. it uses exaggeration: ""appeals till your ears bleed.""
3. this exaggeration is not meant to be taken literally.
4. the tone implies frustration with a lengthy appeals process.
5. the statement uses hyperbole to make a point about the tedious nature of death penalty cases.
6. the exaggerated language and implied criticism suggest this is not a straightforward, factual statement.

given these observations, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to comment on the legal system.

Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.,0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the text starts with a question: ""is that not agnostic?"" this doesn't immediately signal sarcasm.

2. the next sentence, ""you leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it,"" seems to be a genuine observation or statement, not sarcastic.

3. the final sentence, ""sorry if this is just turning into word games,"" appears to be a sincere apology for potentially overcomplicating the conversation.

4. the overall tone seems earnest and contemplative rather than mocking or ironic.

5. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, contradiction, or use of humor to criticize.

6. the language is straightforward and doesn't contain any subtle jabs or hidden meanings that might suggest sarcasm.

given these observations, the text appears to be a genuine inquiry and reflection rather than a sarcastic comment.

2. it cites specific percentages and sources (gallup and cuny).
3. the tone is neutral and informative.
4. there's no hint of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction.

"As is obvious, not all would.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. analyze the context:
   the phrase ""as is obvious"" is often used to introduce a statement that is considered self-evident.

2. consider the statement:
   ""not all would"" is a vague and incomplete statement without more context.

3. look for sarcastic indicators:
   - the use of ""as is obvious"" could be interpreted as overstating the obviousness of something that might not actually be obvious.
   - the incomplete nature of the statement could be seen as a deliberate attempt to create ambiguity or irony.

4. assess the tone:
   without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a mocking or ironic tone.

5. consider alternative interpretations:
   it's possible this is simply a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement acknowledging that something isn't universally applicable.

6. make a judgment:
   given the limited context and the potential for the phrase ""as is obvious"" to be used sarcastically, there's a slight lean towards sarcasm, but it's not definitive.

based on this analysis, i'll make a decision, but note that with such limited context, this is a challenging classification:

So once again you're steering away from the debate? I don't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post. You're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened. You're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation. I'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now.   [quote]The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\QUOTE]   It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up. I guess in your mind this makes sense but I don't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic.,0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. the text is long and argumentative, which is often a characteristic of non-sarcastic debate.

2. the author is directly addressing someone, critiquing their argument style and interpretation of religious texts.

3. the tone is confrontational and critical, but it doesn't use irony or say the opposite of what's meant.

4. phrases like ""i don't understand why"" and ""i'm sure you won't even considered"" are direct expressions of frustration, not sarcastic remarks.

5. the author is making serious points about biblical interpretation and logical reasoning.

6. there's no use of exaggeration or mock praise, which are common in sarcasm.

7. the language is straightforward and meant to be taken literally, not figuratively.

given these observations, the text appears to be a genuine critique without sarcastic intent.

Male,0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. the input is simply the word ""male"".

2. this is a single word without any context or sentence structure.

3. sarcasm typically requires context, tone, or a complete statement to be understood.

4. a single descriptive word like ""male"" doesn't inherently convey any sarcastic intent.

5. there's no obvious irony, exaggeration, or contradiction present.

6. without any additional context or information, it's impossible to interpret this as sarcastic.

therefore, based on this analysis:

"Sure.   The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.   Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.   Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.   And, of course the US Supreme Court agrees with this, thus ruling that per the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, the woman has the right to privacy, to control her onw body.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

"Actually it wasn't sitting somewhere since there was no ""where"" to ""sit"" and ""always"" and ""eternity"" have no meaning outside of time and no ""time"" existed prior to the ""Big Bang"", maybe.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text begins with ""actually,"" which often introduces a correction or contradiction.
2. the content discusses complex concepts of space, time, and existence before the big bang.
3. the language is unnecessarily convoluted and overly technical for a casual statement.
4. the use of quotation marks around words like ""where,"" ""sit,"" and ""time"" suggests a mocking tone.
5. the statement ends with ""maybe,"" which undermines the certainty of the entire argument.
6. the overall tone appears to be making fun of overly philosophical or scientific discussions.

given these observations, the text seems to be intentionally complicated and mocking, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.

Just a newly-evolved structure. It happens.,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. context: the statement seems to be referring to some kind of structure, possibly biological or evolutionary.

2. content analysis:
   - ""just a newly-evolved structure"" - this phrase downplays the significance of evolution, which is actually a complex and time-consuming process.
   - ""it happens"" - this casual dismissal further trivializes the concept of evolution.

3. tone: the casual and dismissive tone doesn't match the complexity of the subject matter (evolution).

4. implied meaning: the speaker is likely not actually suggesting that new structures simply evolve quickly or easily.

5. contrast: there's a contrast between the scientific weight of evolution and the nonchalant way it's described.

6. common sarcastic elements: understatement and feigned indifference are present, which are often used in sarcasm.

given these factors, especially the mismatch between the casual tone and the complex subject, as well as the understated presentation of a significant concept, this statement appears to be sarcastic.

Uh. No they didn't. Have you ever actually taken a biology course?,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the response is confrontational and dismissive.
2. it starts with ""uh. no they didn't."" which is a direct contradiction.
3. the question ""have you ever actually taken a biology course?"" is rhetorical and implies the other person lacks basic knowledge.

"Actually just as many atheist help the needy.   Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text is lengthy and informative, providing examples of atheist philanthropists and organizations.

2. the tone is defensive and argumentative, directly addressing and countering a presumed opposing viewpoint.

3. there are some phrases that could be considered sarcastic, such as ""oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?"" and ""*cough* religious *cough* fanfare.""

4. however, these phrases are minor elements in an otherwise straightforward, fact-based argument.

5. the overall intent seems to be to inform and persuade, not to mock or be sarcastic.

6. the text is primarily focused on providing information and examples to support its point, rather than using irony or sarcasm as its main approach.

given these considerations, while there are elements that could be interpreted as mildly sarcastic, the overall text does not primarily rely on sarcasm to convey its message. therefore, the most appropriate classification is:

"believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the text is serious and analytical, not mocking or ironic.

"By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course, which is different to imprisonment of the criminal.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. tone analysis: the statement has a critical and accusatory tone.

2. context implication: it appears to be responding to someone else's comment about ""removing"" something or someone.

3. contrast of terms: the author deliberately contrasts ""removing"" with ""killing,"" and ""innocent"" with ""criminal.""

4. exaggeration: the use of ""of course"" suggests an exaggerated certainty about the other person's intentions.

5. implied criticism: the statement implies that the other person is trying to euphemize or downplay a serious action.

6. irony: there's an ironic juxtaposition between the mild term ""removing"" and the harsh reality of ""killing.""

given these factors, especially the use of irony and exaggeration to make a point, this statement appears to be sarcastic.

"It depends on the particular situation. Some adoption agencies ask about it, and some don't. Most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions. Some adoptive gay parents are out about it, and some keep it quiet.   There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, ""I am not homosexual."" Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely. They have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents. In the case of a couple, their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt. No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text provides factual information about adoption processes and policies.
2. it discusses various aspects of adoption, including how agencies handle gay parents and international adoption rules.
3. the tone is informative and straightforward, without any obvious exaggeration or irony.
4. the content, while potentially controversial, is presented in a matter-of-fact manner.
5. there are no elements of humor, exaggeration, or unexpected twists that are typical of sarcasm.

"Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.

"(Note the key word ""also,"" which admits that it's human).   As for the rest, This is more of the sort of ""defensive rationalization"" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own ""brilliance"" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a ""parasite"" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human.   However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.   Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk.   Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.   This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text is long and complex, discussing abortion and fetal rights.

4. the text presents a logical (though controversial) argument, citing concepts like ""strict liability.""
5. there are no obvious jokes, exaggerations, or ironic statements that would indicate sarcasm.
6. the language is direct and meant to be taken at face value, not interpreted in an opposite way.
7. the author seems passionate and sincere about their viewpoint, not mocking or ridiculing an opposing view.

1. the input is just a url to a new york times article.
2. there's no actual text content provided, just the link.
3. a url alone doesn't contain enough information to determine sarcasm.
4. news article urls, especially from reputable sources like the new york times, are typically neutral and factual.

But is the Red Cross Christian? Obviously most contributors are Christian. That's obvious as most Americans are Christian.,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the statement starts with a question about whether the red cross is christian.
2. it then states that ""obviously"" most contributors are christian.
3. this is followed by repeating that it's ""obvious"" because most americans are christian.
4. the repetition of ""obvious"" and the oversimplification of the red cross's religious affiliation based solely on the majority religion in america suggests an exaggerated or mocking tone.
5. the statement seems to be poking fun at the assumption that the red cross must be christian simply because it operates in a predominantly christian country.
6. this kind of oversimplification and mock certainty is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to critique a simplistic view of the red cross's religious affiliation.

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing.

2. exaggeration: the speaker claims to have ""no idea"" and says it makes ""no sense"" at all, which seems extreme.

"you're looking at evolution in way too much of a magical and mystical way. Evolution doesn't ""know"" anything. It doesn't have any desires... and... i lack the eloquence to briefly state mechanical (and complete lack of desire) aspects of evolution. i suggest you do research as to how there are no conscious thinking elements in evolution.   Science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out. The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.   If you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god... well go ahead... but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you. At the very best all you are doing is showing that the idea that God created all things perfectly probably isn't true... and even then someone can just point out that apparent flaws we see are simply the ineffable will of god.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text is long and detailed, discussing evolution and science in a serious tone.

"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.",0,not sarcastic,0

"Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. tone analysis: the text uses phrases like ""oh, so..."" and ""please, that's just pathetic,"" which indicate a mocking or condescending tone.

2. context: the message refers to posts on a ""c vs e board,"" likely meaning a creationism versus evolution debate forum.

3. rhetorical question: ""then why are they posted on the c vs e board?"" this question isn't seeking information but making a point.

Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures.

Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example.

2. literal meaning: the sentence is stating a factual reason for something, explaining that certain things have contradictory properties.

3. tone: the tone appears straightforward and matter-of-fact. there's no obvious exaggeration or irony.

4. intent: it seems to be providing a simple explanation rather than making a joke or criticizing something indirectly.

5. sarcasm indicators: there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as hyperbole, unexpected twists, or incongruity between the statement and a known reality.

6. instruction compliance: the text includes ""let's think step by step,"" which is part of the given instruction rather than the content to be classified.

given these considerations, the statement appears to be a straightforward explanation without sarcastic intent.

The Skeptic has requested no judges.   This actually suits me as there are too many of you that I'd have to pick from and I therefore avoid slighting anyone by not picking them,0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the first sentence states a fact: ""the skeptic has requested no judges.""

2. the second sentence begins with ""this actually suits me..."" which suggests the speaker is expressing a personal opinion or feeling about the situation.

3. the reason given for why it suits them is unusual and potentially insincere: avoiding having to choose judges to avoid slighting anyone.

4. this reasoning seems exaggerated and unlikely to be the real reason someone would be happy about not having judges.

5. the tone implies that the speaker is making light of the situation by providing an overly elaborate and unlikely explanation for their satisfaction.

6. the statement appears to be using humor to indirectly comment on the difficulty or awkwardness of choosing judges.

given these observations, the statement appears to be using irony to make a humorous point, which is a key characteristic of sarcasm.

"I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. ""Evolutionism"" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world.

FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.",0,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. tone: the text is highly critical and confrontational, using phrases like ""lack of knowledge,"" ""ignorant as all heck,"" and ""ffs.""

2. context: the writer is responding to someone else's sources or claims about the big bang theory and the age of the universe.

3. irony: the opening line ""damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge"" is likely not meant to be taken literally. it's a sarcastic way of saying the opposite - that the links are poor sources.

4. exaggeration: the use of ""ignorant as all heck"" is an exaggerated way to emphasize the perceived poor quality of the sources.

5. rhetorical questions: ""do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?"" is not a genuine question but a sarcastic way to criticize.

6. mockery: the writer mocks the other person's understanding of scientific history and their choice of sources.

7. condescension: the final suggestion to ""try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old"" is delivered in a sarcastic, condescending manner.

given these elements, particularly the irony, exaggeration, and mocking tone, the text is clearly sarcastic.

"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.

That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so.

All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now.

Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time.

"I dunno, maybe it was in the third trimester?",1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. first, we need to consider the context. the statement seems to be a response to a question, likely about when something happened during a pregnancy.

2. the phrase ""i dunno"" (informal for ""i don't know"") at the beginning suggests uncertainty or casualness.

3. the use of ""maybe"" further emphasizes this uncertainty.

4. however, the reference to the ""third trimester"" is very specific, which contrasts with the expressed uncertainty.

5. in a genuine response, if someone doesn't know, they typically wouldn't guess such a specific time frame.

6. the juxtaposition of claimed ignorance (""i dunno"") with a precise guess (""third trimester"") creates an incongruity.

7. this incongruity is a hallmark of sarcasm, where the literal meaning contradicts the intended message.

8. the sarcasm here likely implies that the answer should be obvious, possibly mocking the original question.

given this analysis, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to convey exasperation or to point out the obviousness of the answer.

"Hmmm... interesting. Where does this inalianable right derive from and how does it really work? I mean, clearly you cannot create your own army called Islamic Jihad of Al queda Supporters and start to develop weapons of mass destruction on your own farm, regardless if that organisation actually interfer with someone else.   As for bootlicking   Please drop the rethorics and explain how you mean instead.",1,sarcastic,1
"Way to make a controversial, unsupported assertion, Winston!",1,"to analyze this step-by-step:

1. tone: the exclamation and use of ""way to..."" suggests an exaggerated compliment.

2. content: the speaker is criticizing winston for making a ""controversial, unsupported assertion.""

3. contradiction: praising someone for making an unsupported claim is typically not sincere.

4. context: the phrase ""way to..."" is often used sarcastically to point out a mistake or poor choice.

5. intent: the speaker seems to be mocking winston rather than genuinely complimenting him.

given these factors, the statement appears to be using irony to convey criticism, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

"Yes they sure will.... with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns.

"So you are saying that despite the majority of the public opposing gay marriage, opposing it may be the wrong direction?   Good for you. You're getting it.",1,"let's break this down step-by-step:

1. the first sentence appears to be asking a question, possibly repeating someone else's statement with a hint of disbelief.

2. the second sentence, ""good for you. you're getting it."" is key to understanding the tone.

3. this response doesn't seem to match the skeptical tone of the question. instead, it's overly praising and encouraging.

4. the contrast between the questioning tone and the exaggerated praise suggests the speaker isn't being sincere.

5. the speaker is likely using this exaggerated praise to emphasize that the other person has finally understood something that the speaker considers obvious.

6. this type of exaggerated, insincere praise is a common sarcastic technique.

given this analysis, the response is clearly not meant to be taken at face value.

1. the text starts with ""oh, i dunno guys... i think i've been saved."" this sounds insincere and mocking.

2. the user then starts singing a religious hymn, but abruptly shifts to talking about barbecued lamb, which is irreverent and inappropriate in this context.

3. the mention of ""rare"" lamb right after a religious reference is deliberately provocative.

4. the text then mentions trading photos of a ""holy pink bunny"" for the shroud of turin. this is clearly not serious and mocks religious artifacts.

5. the overall tone is flippant and mocking towards religious concepts.

given these observations, the text is clearly not sincere and is using humor to mock religious ideas.

"Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?",1,not sarcastic,0
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the text seems matter-of-fact and explanatory, not sarcastic.
2. the writer is providing information about cross-jurisdictional escorts being common.
3. they're pointing out that it's the article's author complaining, not the local police.
4. the use of ""whining"" suggests some criticism of the article's author, but it's direct rather than sarcastic.
5. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking language.
6. the overall intent appears to be to clarify a situation, not to make a sarcastic comment.

based on this analysis, the appropriate label is:

"Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there.",1,not sarcastic,0

Don't forget Jerry Brown will probably have some changes of his own. Seems he is more pro rights and 2A than 'da terminator'.",1,"to approach this step-by-step:

1. the text begins with ""oh yeah, like that hasn't been tried before /sarcasm"" - this is an explicit indicator of sarcasm.

2. the tone throughout is mocking and exaggerated, especially when referring to ""nefarious excuse"" and ""farther control the people"".

3. the use of ""kalifornia"" instead of california is a derisive misspelling, often used sarcastically.

4. the text ends with a mocking ""wa wa wa wa wa!"" which is not a serious argument but a sarcastic imitation.

5. while some parts discuss real concerns, the overall tone and exaggerated language suggest the author is not being entirely serious, but rather using sarcasm to make their point.

given these observations, particularly the explicit ""/sarcasm"" tag and the overall tone, the classification is clear.

"Or, given that this is about feasts, a waist is a terrible thing to mind.",1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. the phrase ""a waist is a terrible thing to mind"" is a play on the famous quote ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste.""

2. the word ""waist"" is substituted for ""waste,"" creating a pun.

3. this wordplay is cleverly tied to the context of ""feasts,"" implying that worrying about one's waistline during a feast is unnecessary or contradictory.

4. the humor lies in the unexpected twist of the familiar phrase and its application to the context of eating.

5. sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant or using irony for humorous effect.

6. in this case, the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to humorously point out the conflict between enjoying a feast and worrying about weight gain.

given these observations, the statement demonstrates clever wordplay, irony, and humor characteristic of sarcasm.

"The guys who want guns in their homes to protect themselves from burglars or ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" call others full of fear and mistrust?",1,"1. the statement points out an apparent contradiction in the behavior of gun advocates.

2. it suggests gun owners claim to need weapons for protection or potential revolution.

3. the same group apparently accuses others of being fearful and mistrustful.

4. the question format implies the speaker finds this stance hypocritical or ironic.

5. the tone is mocking and critical of the gun owners' position.

6. the use of quotation marks around ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" indicates skepticism or ridicule.

7. the overall message is conveying criticism through irony, highlighting perceived inconsistency in the gun owners' stance.

given these observations, the statement is clearly using irony to make a point, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

"Less than a playstation, of course!",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the phrase ""less than a playstation, of course!"" seems to lack context.
2. however, the use of ""of course!"" at the end suggests an exaggerated certainty.
3. this exaggeration is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
4. the statement also implies a comparison between something and a playstation, which seems unusual without context.
5. the unexpected nature of this comparison, combined with the emphatic ""of course!"", strongly hints at sarcasm.
6. the brevity and abruptness of the statement further support a sarcastic tone.

considering these factors, the most likely classification is:

"Because his, as a Christian, doesn't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does.   ""Quote mine"" - looks like that will be a common acusation here. If I keep things concise and readable, I'm quote mining. That quote wasn't about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution, far more than ""believers"" (creationists)   And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.   Again, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying.   No, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to ""correct"" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6.

All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!

His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.   Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited.   So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about ""preachers"", he wasn't referring to priests?

1. the text is long and complex, discussing religious beliefs, evolution, and atheism.
2. the tone is argumentative and defensive, with the author responding to various points.
3. there are several instances of sarcasm and mockery, such as:
   - ""sure they were, christians are always opposing christianity!""
   - ""so you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about 'preachers', he wasn't referring to priests? i've seen it all now.""
4. the author uses rhetorical questions and exaggeration to make points.
5. there's a sense of frustration and irony throughout the text.
6. the overall tone is not straightforward, but rather critical and mocking.

given these observations, the text contains multiple instances of sarcasm and a generally sarcastic tone.

1. the tone of the text is confrontational and defensive.
2. the author begins with a sarcastic invitation: ""sure let me have your sermon/propaganda of misinformation...""
3. they then provide dictionary definitions to support their argument.
4. the author dismisses the other person's experience and expertise.
5. they quote scripture to further support their position.
6. the overall message is a rejection of the other person's viewpoint, delivered in a mocking tone.

given these observations, particularly the opening line which is clearly sarcastic, the appropriate label is:

2. however, it's often used sarcastically when something is actually not informative at all.
3. the brevity and apparent simplicity of the statement suggest it's likely not meant to be taken at face value.
4. people rarely say ""how informative"" genuinely; it's more commonly used to express disappointment or frustration with a lack of useful information.
5. the tone seems dismissive rather than appreciative, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given these considerations, the most likely classification is:

In other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law.   Admit it.,1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. the tone of the statement is accusatory and confrontational.
2. it's implying that someone is happy about an illegal act, which is not likely to be a sincere sentiment.
3. the phrase ""admit it"" at the end suggests the speaker is trying to expose what they believe is the true, hidden meaning behind someone else's words.
4. the exaggerated interpretation of someone else's stance (being happy about a crime) is a common sarcastic technique.
5. the statement is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to point out perceived hypocrisy or inconsistency in someone's position.

given these factors, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to criticize someone's viewpoint.

"Wonder what ""euthanization"" is. Never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the word ""euthanization"" is a real term, derived from ""euthanize"" or ""euthanasia"".
2. it's a relatively common term, especially in discussions about animal welfare or end-of-life care.
3. the speaker claims to have never heard of it, which is unlikely for most english speakers.
4. they also claim it's not in the dictionary, which is false as it's a standard term.
5. the tone suggests the speaker is pretending ignorance about a well-known concept.
6. this feigned ignorance is likely meant to mock or criticize the concept or its use.

given these points, the statement is clearly not sincere and is using irony to make a point.

Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text starts with a comparison between ""reasonable gun regulation"" and ""military intelligence,"" calling both oxymorons. this is typically a sarcastic way to criticize both concepts.

2. the phrase ""you mean like..."" is often used to introduce counterexamples sarcastically.

3. the mention of bill ayers and carl rowen appears to be bringing up left-wing figures in a context about gun regulation, which is unexpected and likely meant to be ironic.

4. the ""wait my bad"" is a sarcastic way of pretending to correct oneself while actually emphasizing the point.

5. the final statement ""they aren't from the right"" is likely meant to highlight perceived hypocrisy or double standards in political discourse about gun regulation.

given these elements of irony, unexpected comparisons, and mock self-correction, this text is clearly using sarcasm to make its point.

So you think Zeus and all the other Greek gods exist?,1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. context: the question is about greek gods, specifically zeus.

2. tone: the question seems to be asking for confirmation about believing in greek gods.

3. modern perspective: in today's world, greek mythology is generally considered as ancient stories, not as current religious beliefs.

4. implication: asking if someone believes in zeus and other greek gods today often carries an undertone of disbelief or mockery.

5. expectation: the expected answer to this question in most contexts would be ""no.""

6. intent: by asking this question, the speaker is likely implying that believing in greek gods is absurd or outdated.

7. sarcasm indicator: the question itself serves as a rhetorical device, not genuinely seeking an answer but rather making a point through irony.

given these factors, especially the implied mockery and the use of a rhetorical question to make a point, this statement is likely meant to be sarcastic.

And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.,1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. the statement refers to the dunblane massacre, a tragic mass shooting event in scotland in 1996.

2. it mentions a ""handgun ban"" that occurred after this single event.

3. the tone seems to be drawing a contrast between a swift response to one incident and (implied) inaction after multiple incidents elsewhere.

4. the use of ""and yet"" at the beginning suggests this is part of a larger conversation, likely about gun control measures.

5. the statement appears to be highlighting the irony or inconsistency in how different societies respond to gun violence.

6. there's an implied criticism or frustration in the brevity of ""only one event,"" suggesting that other places haven't taken action despite multiple incidents.

given these observations, the statement is using irony to make a point about gun control policies. the sarcasm is subtle but present in the contrast between swift action after one event versus implied inaction elsewhere.

sarcastic",1
"Yes, have you?",1,"to analyze this properly, let's think through it step-by-step:

1. the input is very short: ""yes, have you?""

2. this phrase is typically used as a response to a question, but we don't have the context of the previous question.

3. without context, it's difficult to determine if this is sarcastic or not.

4. the phrase itself is neutral and can be used sincerely in many situations.

5. there are no obvious markers of sarcasm like exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.

6. while sarcasm is possible depending on tone and context, we don't have enough information to conclude it's sarcastic.

7. in the absence of clear sarcastic indicators, it's safer to assume the statement is not sarcastic.

given this reasoning, the most appropriate classification is:

Oh!   Did you mean something like this in gun free France:   http://www.guardian.co.uk/internatio...ews+-+guardian   Those weapons were cheap and from an eastern block country. Machine guns are for sissy American felons. Real felons in gun free France use anti-tank weapons.,1,"let's analyze this step by step:

1. the text starts with ""oh!"" which often indicates sarcasm or mock surprise.

2. it refers to ""gun free france"", but then links to an article about weapons, suggesting a contradiction.

3. the phrase ""machine guns are for sissy american felons"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally.

4. the final sentence ""real felons in gun free france use anti-tank weapons"" is an exaggeration and not factual.

5. the overall tone is mocking and contradictory, using extreme examples to make a point about gun control laws.

6. the text is using irony to criticize the concept of ""gun free"" areas by pointing out instances of dangerous weapons in such places.

given these observations, the text is clearly not meant to be taken at face value and is using irony to make a point.

We DID learn about selective hearing in health class.,1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

1. context analysis: the statement mentions ""selective hearing"" in relation to a health class.

2. literal interpretation: on the surface, it seems like a straightforward statement about learning a topic in class.

3. tone consideration: the capitalization of ""did"" suggests emphasis, which could indicate frustration or irony.

You should refrain from calling others arrogant Mr. Kettle.,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. analyze the phrase: ""you should refrain from calling others arrogant mr. kettle.""

But, it is also a fact that Abraham Lincoln, the Commander in Chief of the Union Army, did not believe that the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   According to who? Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness, it in no way follows that all men are not created equal.   Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   And I don't expect you to.

"So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.   And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. ""POOF! Goddidit!"" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

"hey, watch yourself.........watch it..",1,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. tone: the message uses repetition and excessive punctuation ("".........""), which can indicate a dramatic or exaggerated tone.

2. context: without broader context, it's hard to determine if this is a genuine warning or a playful remark.

3. literal vs. intended meaning: the phrase ""watch yourself"" is typically used as a warning, but the repetition and punctuation might suggest it's not meant literally.

4. exaggeration: the excessive dots and repetition of ""watch"" could be seen as an overemphasis, which is common in sarcasm.

5. ambiguity: there's some ambiguity here, as it could be a genuine warning said dramatically, or a sarcastic comment mocking overprotectiveness.

given the exaggeration and potential for mocking overprotectiveness, there's a slight lean towards sarcasm, but it's not definitive.

"You believe that your interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than his, and he believes that his interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than yours. This is quite simple, but that's never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.   No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   ""Concise and readable"" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his ""citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts.""   I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the ""on"" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this ""power,"" too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble ""stomaching"" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc. I love helping you reach new lows.",1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

1. the text is long and complex, with multiple speakers and references.
2. the tone throughout is mocking and critical, often directly addressing someone named ""marc"".
3. there are numerous instances of exaggerated or hyperbolic language.
4. the author frequently uses rhetorical questions and irony to make points.

   - ""keep on diggin', marc. i love helping you reach new lows.""
6. the overall intent seems to be to mock and criticize marc's arguments and interpretations.
