SHELDON: It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.,"LEONARD: I never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the Big Bang.
 SHELDON: My apologies. What's your plan?
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""it's a privilege"" and ""watch your mind at work"" suggest admiration and respect for someone's intellect.

step 2: true intention
given this is a quote from sheldon (likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory""), we need to consider his character and typical speech patterns. sheldon is known for his sarcasm, often delivered in a deadpan manner. he frequently uses seemingly complimentary language to actually express criticism or frustration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, sheldon's character and the likely context suggest this is probably not a genuine compliment. the overly formal and exaggerated nature of the praise (""it's just a privilege"") is a clue that he's likely mocking someone's thought process rather than genuinely admiring it.

### label: sarcastic

given sheldon's character and the exaggerated nature of the praise, this statement is most likely sarcastic, used to criticize someone's reasoning rather than genuinely compliment it.",1

 HOWARD: His name is Buttons.
 HOWARD: Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
 PENNY: That sounds interesting.
 HOWARD: You'll think about it?
",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of penny's thoughts and feelings. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the speaker is directly communicating that a particular topic or situation is likely to occupy their thoughts for some time. this kind of candid expression of one's mental state is typically not associated with sarcasm.",0
"SHELDON: Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.","LEONARD: Here we go. Pad thai, no peanuts.
 HOWARD: But does it have peanut oil?
 LEONARD: I'm not sure. Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. sheldon is offering his epinephrine to someone, which could be seen as a helpful gesture.

step 2: true intention
understanding the context is crucial here. sheldon is a character from ""the big bang theory"" known for his literal interpretations and lack of social awareness. offering epinephrine (used for severe allergic reactions) when it's not bee season is an oddly specific and unnecessary offer. this suggests that sheldon is missing the point of a conversation or situation, likely offering a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment seems helpful, the true intention reveals sheldon's characteristic misunderstanding of social situations. the humor comes from the mismatch between the oddly specific offer and what would be a normal response in a conversation. however, sheldon himself is not intentionally being sarcastic; he's being earnest in his unusual way.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement is typical of sheldon's character - literal, well-meaning, but socially awkward. it's humorous, but not sarcastic in the traditional sense, as sheldon genuinely means what he's saying.",0
"SHELDON: Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour, hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.","PENNY: A marathon? How many Superman movies are there?
 SHELDON: You're kidding, right?
 PENNY: I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her. Which one was that?
 SHELDON: One.
 SHELDON: You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
 PENNY: Yes, I know, men can't fly.
 SHELDON: Let's assume that they can.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or even slightly positive. it's presented as a matter-of-fact description of superman attempting to save lois lane. the use of scientific terms like ""accelerating"" and precise measurements gives it a seemingly objective tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear when we consider the unexpected and gruesome outcome. instead of superman heroically saving lois lane, she is ""immediately sliced into three equal pieces"" upon impact with his arms. this shocking twist subverts the expected superhero narrative in a darkly humorous way.

step 3: compare and analyze
the contrast between the seemingly objective, scientific description and the absurdly tragic outcome creates a stark juxtaposition. this unexpected turn of events, delivered in a deadpan manner, is characteristic of dark humor and sarcasm. the speaker is using this exaggerated scenario to satirize the unrealistic physics often employed in superhero stories.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a scientific facade to deliver an unexpectedly dark and absurd outcome, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.",1

 SHELDON: The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy. This is chaos.
 SHELDON: Excuse me.
 SHELDON: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral or slightly confused. sheldon is describing what he sees - a coffee table that seems to be having a ""tiny garage sale.""

step 2: the true intention becomes clear when we consider the context and absurdity of the statement. coffee tables don't have garage sales. this is sheldon's sarcastic way of saying the coffee table is extremely cluttered or messy.

step 3: the sarcasm comes from the deliberate use of an absurd, impossible scenario (a coffee table having a garage sale) to criticize or comment on the actual state of the coffee table. the disparity between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a classic hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is using dry humor and exaggeration to comment on the messy state of the coffee table, comparing it humorously to a garage sale.",1
"HOWARD: Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't...","PERSON: On the other hand, no arousal.
 LEONARD: None?
 PERSON: None.
 LEONARD: Thank you for your time.
 PERSON: Thank you.
 LEONARD: None at all?
",BBT,0,"to properly analyze this input for sarcasm, i'll need to think through it step-by-step, as the context isn't entirely clear and there's no obvious sarcastic tone on the surface.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. howard is posing a hypothetical scenario to sheldon about him being a robot. there are no clearly positive or negative words, no emojis, and no obvious sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
this line appears to be part of a larger conversation or scene, likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory."" howard is setting up a hypothetical situation, possibly as part of a joke or to make a point about sheldon's behavior. the true intention seems to be to engage sheldon in a thought experiment or to tease him about his robotic-like behavior.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment (neutral) with the likely intention (teasing or setting up a joke), there's a potential for sarcasm or irony. however, without more context or the rest of the conversation, it's difficult to definitively label this as sarcastic. the setup of the hypothetical scenario could be leading to a sarcastic punchline, but this line alone doesn't contain clear sarcasm.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic indicators in this single line, i would err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification is made with less than 90% confidence due to the limited context provided. the full conversation or scene would be needed for a more accurate assessment.",0
"SHELDON: If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.","SHELDON: Oh, good Lord.
 LEONARD: God, that's a good song.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or dark. the phrase ""double suicide"" is inherently negative, and the mention of a scratching post being ""for you"" seems oddly placed and potentially insulting.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to make a biting, humorous comment. sheldon is known for his acerbic wit in ""the big bang theory,"" and this line is typical of his character. he's implying that the music is so depressing it could lead to suicide, and then follows up with a seemingly unrelated insult about a scratching post (likely implying the person is cat-like or needs to sharpen their claws).

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is negative, but it's deliberately exaggerated for comedic effect. the true intention is to be humorous through the use of dark humor and unexpected insults. the stark contrast between the serious topic of suicide and the trivial mention of a scratching post creates a jarring effect typical of sarcasm.

the combination of dark humor, exaggeration, and the unexpected juxtaposition of ideas are clear indicators of sarcasm. therefore, the classification of ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1
SHELDON: No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.,"LEONARD: How do I look?
 SHELDON: Could you be more specific?
 LEONARD: Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
",BBT,1,"step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. sheldon is saying that something is concealed ""nicely,"" which on its face seems like a compliment or positive observation.

step 2: true intention
however, considering this is sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory""), who is known for his lack of social skills and blunt honesty, the true intention is likely not positive. he's probably pointing out sweat stains in a very direct and potentially embarrassing way for the other person. the use of ""dark crescent-shaped patterns"" is a euphemistic way to describe sweat stains, which is not typically considered a nice thing to point out.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (positive) conflicts with the likely true intention (pointing out something embarrassing). this mismatch between the seemingly nice phrasing and the actually uncomfortable subject matter is a hallmark of sarcasm. while sheldon may not intend to be sarcastic (given his character), the statement itself functions as sarcasm in this context.

"SHELDON: How's this? ""Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser. ""How fortunate for you that the university's ""chosen to hire you, despite the fact ""that you've done no original research in 25 years, ""and instead have written a series of popular books ""that reduce the great concepts of science ""to a series of anecdotes, ""each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration ""of an average bowel movement.","SHELDON: You know, I am not going to enjoy this party.

 LEONARD: What?
 SHELDON: Nothing.
 LEONARD: Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first, with phrases like ""pleased to meet you"" and ""how fortunate for you"". however, it quickly shifts to a negative tone with criticisms about lack of original research, dumbing down concepts, and comparing the content to bowel movements.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is clearly not to genuinely welcome or compliment dr. gablehauser. instead, it's a thinly veiled criticism of the doctor's work and the university's decision to hire him. the speaker (sheldon) is using polite introductory phrases to set up a contrast with the harsh criticisms that follow.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the initial polite greeting and the subsequent harsh criticism is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to emphasize his disapproval. the phrase ""how fortunate for you"" is particularly sarcastic when followed by a list of perceived shortcomings.

based on this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
"LEONARD: Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in Advanced Placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.","PERSON: He switched over to high-energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

 PERSON: Nice meeting you.
 PENNY: Yeah, you, too.
Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break it down to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems negative. leonard is talking about being beaten up and implies his parents' choices contributed to this.

step 2: the true intention is to humorously criticize his parents' decisions. leonard is using exaggeration and self-deprecating humor to imply that his parents' choices (his name and advanced classes) made him a target for bullying.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see a clear mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended message. leonard isn't seriously suggesting his parents wanted him to get beaten up more. he's using sarcasm to express frustration with their choices that unintentionally made his social life difficult.

the use of exaggeration (""wasn't getting me beaten up enough"") and the implied criticism of his parents' decisions through a seemingly absurd statement are strong indicators of sarcasm.

therefore, the final label is: sarcastic.",1

 SHELDON: We play teams, not one-on-one.
 SHELDON: One-on-one.
 LEONARD: The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be callous and uncaring. the phrase ""cut the foreigner in half"" is shocking and violent. the statement ""there's a billion more where he came from"" seems to devalue human life, treating people as disposable.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. the speaker is probably using dark humor to criticize xenophobia or callous attitudes towards immigrants or foreigners. the exaggeration of ""cut the foreigner in half"" and the dismissive ""billion more"" are likely intentionally outrageous to highlight the absurdity of dehumanizing people.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the surface-level callousness and the likely intended criticism of such attitudes strongly suggests sarcasm. the use of hyperbole and shock value are common sarcastic techniques to make a point about social issues.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly using extreme language to sarcastically criticize prejudiced or inhumane attitudes towards foreigners or immigrants.",1
"RAJ: Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi, Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali.","LEONARD: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of American membership card?

 SHELDON: It's right here under Batman's signature.
 RAJ: and this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
 HOWARD: Guess whose parents just got broadband.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this introduction by raj appears to be a straightforward and sincere presentation of his parents to leonard via a video call or similar communication method. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this statement. the formal and respectful tone used to introduce his parents (""dr. and mrs. v. m. koothrappali"") and the specific mention of ""live from new delhi"" suggest this is a genuine introduction without any hidden or contradictory meanings.",0

 SHELDON: Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears apologetic with ""i'm sorry,"" but then immediately contradicts this with a negative statement about having no room in the wallet. the overall surface sentiment is negative and dismissive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be a rejection or refusal, likely in response to someone asking for money or to be included in something. the apology at the beginning is not genuine but rather a social formality before delivering the rejection. the phrase ""no room in my wallet"" is likely a metaphor for not wanting to spend money on or include the other person.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface starts with an apology, it quickly shifts to a clear rejection. the use of ""well,"" at the beginning and the contrast between ""i'm sorry"" and ""but there's just no room"" suggests a dismissive tone. the metaphorical use of the wallet adds a touch of humor or cleverness to the rejection.

given this analysis, there's a mismatch between the initial apologetic tone and the actual rejection, along with the somewhat humorous metaphor. this suggests a sarcastic intent.

this statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic communication. raj is informing someone that he has made some inquiries or put out some preliminary efforts (""got some feelers out"") and is then directing attention to something else he wants the listener to hear. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm in the phrasing or context provided.",0

 LEONARD: We all know the reason.
 LEONARD: Sheldon, what are you getting at?
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and excited. key phrases like ""exactly like"", ""beloved fictional character"", and ""come to life"" suggest enthusiasm and wonder at seeing something remarkable.

step 2: true intention
considering this is sheldon speaking (likely from the big bang theory), we need to consider his character traits. sheldon is known for his literal interpretations and lack of social awareness. in this context, he's likely genuinely excited about seeing someone who resembles a fictional character, rather than using sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy. sheldon's enthusiasm seems genuine, and there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration or irony. his question ""how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?"" appears to be a sincere expression of his excitement rather than a sarcastic remark.

### label: not sarcastic

sheldon's statement appears to be a genuine expression of excitement and wonder, consistent with his character's typical behavior, rather than a sarcastic comment.",0

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement from sheldon appears to be a straightforward, literal comment rather than sarcasm. sheldon, known for his logical and literal thinking in the show ""the big bang theory,"" is likely making a factual observation about a constraint or rule (powering down on saturdays) that would apply to someone or something being discussed. there's no apparent discrepancy between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0

 SHELDON: Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays.
 LEONARD: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward explanation of possibilities regarding a letter in a trash can. sheldon presents two scenarios: an unlikely spontaneous formation and a more probable human action.

step 2: the true intention here is to use absurd humor and exaggeration to make a point. sheldon's character is known for his literal and often pedantic approach to explanations. by presenting the ridiculous possibility of a trash can spontaneously forming around a letter, he's using sarcasm to emphasize how obvious the real explanation is.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that while the surface level appears to be a simple explanation, the inclusion of the absurd scenario and the reference to occam's razor (which suggests the simplest explanation is usually correct) creates a sarcastic tone. sheldon is essentially saying, ""of course someone threw it out, isn't that obvious?"" in a roundabout, exaggerated way.

the use of scientific principles (occam's razor) to explain a mundane situation, combined with the absurd alternative scenario, is classic sheldon-style sarcasm. therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic.""",1

 PENNY: Is this your only tie?
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the context isn't entirely clear without more information:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the word ""technically"" suggests a factual statement, while ""but, if you'll notice..."" introduces a potentially positive aspect. the exclamation ""it's reversible!"" conveys enthusiasm or a positive revelation.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. leonard seems to be pointing out a feature (reversibility) that he considers positive or noteworthy. the ""technically, yes"" could be a concession to a previous point, followed by highlighting what he sees as an advantage.

step 3: analysis and inference
given the limited information, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the statement appears to be straightforward, with leonard genuinely highlighting a feature he finds positive or important. the enthusiasm in ""it's reversible!"" seems genuine rather than mocking or sarcastic.

 SHELDON: Hello Penny.
 PENNY: Get anything good?
",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, so i'll provide the direct label without going through the step-by-step process. the statement from sheldon appears to be a straightforward response about what he's reading. given sheldon's character (if this is from ""the big bang theory""), his interest in scientific journals like ""applied particle physics quarterly"" is genuine and aligns with his personality. there's no indication of sarcasm or hidden meaning in this statement; it seems to be a literal and sincere answer.",0
"PENNY: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.","PENNY: Hey Sheldon.
 SHELDON: Hello Penny.
 PENNY: Get anything good?
 SHELDON: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""oh, you know, that is so weird"" doesn't immediately signal strong emotion. the word ""weird"" could be seen as slightly negative, but it's used in a casual, conversational way.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are clues that suggest this might not be a genuine expression of surprise:
1. the emphasis on ""yours came and mine didn't"" implies a contrast that penny finds suspicious.
2. the use of ""so weird"" could be exaggerated, hinting at disbelief rather than genuine puzzlement.
3. the context (though limited) suggests penny might be implying that it's not actually weird, but rather unfair or intentional that the other person received something while she didn't.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is fairly neutral, the underlying tone and implication suggest that penny doesn't actually think it's ""weird"" at all. she's likely using verbal irony to express her suspicion or dissatisfaction with the situation. the exaggerated ""so weird"" combined with the pointed comparison strongly hints at sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

after careful consideration, i'm confident that this statement is indeed sarcastic. penny is using verbal irony to indirectly express her skepticism or displeasure about the situation.",1
SHELDON: Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?,"SHELDON: I want grilled cheese.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly hopeful. sheldon is asking a question about whether penny will come to take care of them. there are no obviously sarcastic keywords, phrases, or emojis. the question seems straightforward.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden intention behind this question. however, knowing sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" he often has trouble understanding social norms and relationships. his question might be genuinely naive rather than sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with what we can infer about the true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy. the question seems to be a genuine inquiry rather than a sarcastic comment.

given this analysis, i believe the most appropriate label is:

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward question from sheldon, likely stemming from his character's typical social naivety rather than any sarcastic intent.",0

 LEONARD: If I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?
 HOWARD: Don't yell at me! I've got to go to the emergency room!
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems urgent and distressed. howard is asking ""now?!"" which implies immediacy, and then mentions his tongue swelling to an exaggerated size, which sounds alarming.

step 2: the true intention here is to express frustration and impatience. the comparison of his tongue swelling ""to the size of a brisket"" is a hyperbolic exaggeration meant to emphasize the urgency of his situation.

step 3: the sarcasm comes from the contrast between the initial question ""now?!"" and the exaggerated, absurd follow-up statement. howard is not actually expecting his tongue to swell to such a ridiculous size; he's using sarcasm to emphasize how obvious and urgent his need for immediate attention is.

the exaggeration and the rhetorical question structure are classic indicators of sarcasm, used here to express frustration and urgency in a dramatically overstated way. therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic.",1

 RAJ: Look, I found an iPod!
 HOWARD: It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it?
",BBT,0,"### label: sarcastic

while i'm quite confident in this classification, i'll walk through the steps to demonstrate my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""slightly used"" suggests a relatively benign description of an item's condition, which could be seen as a normal suggestion for selling something.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear when we consider the context and the absurdity of the suggestion. ""slightly used"" is likely an extreme understatement for whatever item is being discussed. selling something on ebay that's damaged or in poor condition while describing it as ""slightly used"" is a humorous and exaggerated suggestion, not a serious recommendation.

step 3: the contrast between the seemingly innocent surface suggestion and the likely inappropriate or impractical nature of actually doing so reveals the sarcastic intent. the use of quotation marks around ""slightly used"" further emphasizes the speaker's awareness of the absurdity of the description.

therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic, using understatement and implied shared understanding to create humor.",1

 HOWARD: Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere.
 LEONARD: I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and supportive. howard seems to be giving advice on how to comfort someone, using phrases like ""good idea,"" ""hold her, comfort her.""

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear with the last part of the statement: ""and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel."" this suggestion is inappropriate and contradicts the earlier supportive tone. it reveals that howard is not genuinely concerned about comforting the person, but rather sees it as an opportunity for inappropriate physical contact.

step 3: the contrast between the initially supportive tone and the inappropriate suggestion at the end creates a sarcastic effect. howard is not sincerely advising on how to comfort someone, but rather making a crude joke or commentary on taking advantage of a situation.

this juxtaposition of seemingly caring advice with an inappropriate suggestion is a classic sarcastic structure, where the true meaning is opposite to or very different from the surface sentiment. therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic.",1

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral or slightly positive, as sheldon is suggesting a notification to the oxford english dictionary about a word definition. this could be seen as a straightforward, informative statement.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is not actually suggesting a change to the dictionary. he's using exaggeration and irony to criticize someone's use of the word ""plenty"" to describe only two of something.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between the surface statement (notifying dictionary editors) and the actual meaning (criticizing someone's use of ""plenty"") is a clear indicator of sarcasm. sheldon is using hyperbole and mock formality to emphasize how ridiculous he finds the use of ""plenty"" to mean just two.

given this analysis, the statement is definitely sarcastic. sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory"" is known for this kind of dry, biting sarcasm, which further supports this classification.",1
"SHELDON: Oh, please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resumed sending chimps into space.","SHELDON: Pastries such as bear claws?

 PENNY: They have a lot in common. I mean, they're both scientists.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. let me break it down:

1. the phrase ""oh, please"" at the beginning immediately sets a dismissive and mocking tone.

2. the comparison of a person's potential scientific contribution to sending chimps into space is deliberately insulting and absurd.

3. this is a hyperbolic statement meant to belittle someone's intelligence and capabilities by comparing them to animals used in early, crude space experiments.

4. the sarcasm lies in the stark contrast between the surface meaning (a seemingly factual statement about space research) and the true intention (to insult and demean someone's intellectual abilities).

5. given the context of sheldon's character (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory""), he's known for his condescending and sarcastic remarks, especially when criticizing others' intelligence.

this statement is undoubtedly sarcastic, using exaggeration and ridicule to express contempt for someone's scientific abilities.",1

He can be a bit of an eccentric.
 PERSON: If by ""eccentric"" you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward, sincere evaluation of an event or situation. leonard is expressing a positive opinion about how something (likely an experience or interaction) began. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory context. the language is simple and direct, matching the apparent meaning. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"SHELDON: I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.","PERSON1: That's enough.
 PERSON1: Call me.
 LEONARD: Right.
 PENNY: Okay, good night.
 PERSON2: What?
 PENNY: Had a great time. Ciao.
",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to break it down step-by-step. the statement from sheldon appears to be a straightforward expression of his unwillingness to return to the renaissance fair. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this context. sheldon, a character known for his direct and literal communication style, is likely expressing his genuine sentiment without any hidden meaning or irony.",0
SHELDON: You were very clear. As was everyone else at the table.,"SHELDON: Leonard, this is Tom.
 LEONARD: Hi, Tom. Sheldon?
 LEONARD: Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
",BBT,0,"given the context that this is a line spoken by sheldon (likely referring to sheldon cooper from the tv show ""the big bang theory""), and knowing his character's typical communication style, i'll analyze this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be straightforward and positive. sheldon is stating that the person he's talking to was very clear, and so was everyone else at the table. this seems like a simple acknowledgment of clear communication.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing sheldon's character, this statement is likely not as straightforward as it seems. sheldon often misses social cues and takes things literally. the emphasis on ""you were very clear. as was everyone else at the table."" suggests that there might have been some miscommunication or social nuance that sheldon missed, but he's interpreting everything literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level clarity sheldon is describing and the probable reality of the situation (where there was likely some subtext or social cue he missed) creates a humorous contrast. this is a form of situational irony, which is often used in sarcastic humor.

while sheldon himself may not be intentionally sarcastic (as his character often struggles with understanding sarcasm), the line itself functions as a sarcastic comment within the context of the show and for the audience's benefit.

### label: sarcastic

the line is likely meant to be perceived as sarcastic by the audience, even if sheldon himself is not intentionally being sarcastic.",1
"HOWARD: They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen, I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.","RAJ: They're going to digitally add a supernova.
They say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
 SHELDON: Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas that collapses upon itself.
 RAJ: Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.
 RAJ: Go for Koothrappali.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement by howard is clearly sarcastic. the sarcasm is evident in the stark contrast he draws between someone else getting an assistant (implying a level of luxury or special treatment) and his own exaggerated difficulties in obtaining a simple pen.

the comparison between getting an assistant and having to go to extreme measures (using wire cutters at a bank) for a basic office supply like a pen is intentionally absurd. this hyperbole is a classic hallmark of sarcasm, used to emphasize howard's perceived unfairness or frustration with the situation.

the tone implies that howard feels undervalued or treated unfairly compared to whoever ""he"" is that got an assistant. by using such an exaggerated example, howard is sarcastically commenting on the disparity in resources or privileges within his work environment.",1
"SHELDON: Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler.","PERSON: Excuse me, Dr. Cooper. I'm Kathy O'Brien.
 PERSON: I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.
",BBT,1,"to analyze this statement for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. sheldon is talking about publishing something and including an inhaler with it. there are no overtly negative or positive words, though ""maybe"" suggests a casual or considerate tone.

step 2: true intention
knowing this is sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" we can infer more context. sheldon is likely referring to publishing a scientific paper or book. the mention of including an inhaler is odd and doesn't fit with typical academic publishing. this suggests he's implying his work is so exciting or groundbreaking that readers might hyperventilate or have trouble breathing from excitement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is neutral, but the true intention is to boast about the quality or impact of his work in an exaggerated, humorous way. this exaggeration and self-aggrandizement, delivered in sheldon's characteristically deadpan style, is a form of sarcasm. he's not literally planning to include an inhaler, but using this hyperbole to brag about his work.

 RAJ: Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. ""sadly"" indicates a negative sentiment, while ""lucky for her"" suggests a positive sentiment. the description ""pruny and bug-eyed"" typically has negative connotations.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mockery or sarcasm. howard is not genuinely sad about mrs. wolowitz's chlorine sensitivity, nor is he actually considering it ""lucky"" that he likes models to look ""pruny and bug-eyed"". these are typically unattractive features, and the statement is meant to be humorous at mrs. wolowitz's expense.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are misaligned. the seemingly positive ""lucky for her"" is actually used to set up a insult. the statement about liking ""pruny and bug-eyed"" models is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a jab at mrs. wolowitz's appearance.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

 HOWARD: Penny! Penny did it.
 SHELDON: Why would you do that?
 PENNY: I don't know. I was hungry?
What's the big deal?
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

in this case, i'm confident in my judgment without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the statement from sheldon appears to be a straightforward expression of his personal boundary regarding food on his plate. this is consistent with sheldon's character (if we're referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory""), who is known for his particular habits and aversions to people touching his things. there's no indication of irony or sarcasm in this statement; it seems to be a direct and literal expression of his preference.",0

 LEONARD: What's the emergency?
 HOWARD: I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
 SHELDON: Where?
",BBT,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems irritated or annoyed. the question ""where do you think?"" followed by ""on mars!"" suggests frustration with an obvious or silly question.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to sarcastically point out that the location (a dusty highway outside bakersfield) should be obvious, and that suggesting mars as an alternative is absurd. the speaker is using exaggeration and a rhetorical question to emphasize how unlikely and ridiculous any other location would be.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface irritation aligns with the true intention of sarcasm. the use of an extreme, impossible alternative (mars) to contrast with the actual, mundane location (outside bakersfield) is a classic sarcastic technique. the rhetorical question ""where do you think?"" followed by an absurd answer further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

given these elements, it's clear that the statement is intended to be sarcastic, mocking the need to ask about an obvious location.",1

 LEONARD: No one's a scientist like Howard.
 HOWARD: My mother is so gonna love her.
",BBT,1,"let's analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to the phrase ""how nice."" this seems to express approval or pleasantness.

step 2: true intention
however, the rest of the sentence reveals a very different intention. the mention of ""federal prison"" implies illegal activity and serious consequences. the suggestion of carpooling to visit someone in prison is not actually a positive or nice scenario. this stark contrast between the initial ""nice"" comment and the serious implication of prison indicates sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the initial positive sentiment (""how nice"") is completely contradicted by the negative implication of visiting someone in federal prison. this deliberate mismatch between the surface-level pleasantness and the actually unpleasant situation described is a clear indicator of sarcasm. sheldon is not genuinely saying the situation is nice; he's using sarcasm to highlight the severity or absurdity of the situation.

 LEONARD: Oh, my God, what did you do?
",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the speaker is describing a specific action they took in what seems to be a genuine, straightforward manner. they're explaining how they handled an awkward or potentially embarrassing situation (presumably having lost or broken one earring) by discreetly removing the other earring and leaving quickly.

the language used is direct and descriptive, without any obvious irony, exaggeration, or contrast between surface meaning and intended meaning that would typically indicate sarcasm. the speaker appears to be honestly recounting their actions and thought process in that moment.

the phrase ""got the hell out of there"" adds a sense of urgency or mild drama to the story, but it doesn't introduce any sarcastic element. instead, it reinforces the idea that the speaker was trying to leave quickly to avoid drawing attention to their situation.

given these factors, the statement comes across as a sincere description of events rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
LEONARD: The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?,"LEONARD: What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?! What, Sheldon?!
 SHELDON: Tell me what you see here.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to words like ""blunt instrument"" and ""murder trial."" these phrases typically carry negative connotations associated with violence and legal trouble.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, this sentence seems to be a witty or humorous response rather than a serious statement about murder. the phrasing suggests it's likely a response to someone else's comment or action, possibly in a comedic context. the exaggerated nature of linking a mundane object to a murder trial hints at sarcasm or dark humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention appears to be humorous or sarcastic. the extreme contrast between a presumably ordinary situation and the dramatic scenario of a murder trial strongly suggests sarcasm. the character (leonard) is likely making a joke by drastically overstating the consequences of whatever is being discussed.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the statement employs exaggeration and dark humor in a way that's characteristic of sarcastic speech, especially in a sitcom-like context (given the character name provided).",1

 LEONARD: Huh
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the aggressive nature of the question. the phrase ""punched you in the face"" is violent and typically associated with negative emotions or intentions.

step 2: true intention
in context, this line is likely not meant to be taken literally. it's probably a rhetorical question expressing frustration or exasperation. the speaker (leonard) is likely not actually intending to punch anyone, but rather expressing his annoyance or irritation with the situation or the person he's talking to.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is aggressive, the true intention is likely to express frustration in a hyperbolic manner. the contrast between the literal meaning (actual violence) and the probable intent (expressing frustration) suggests a form of verbal irony. this kind of exaggerated statement used to convey a different meaning than what is literally said is a common form of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses an exaggerated, violent suggestion to express frustration, which is a classic sarcastic technique. therefore, i classify this statement as sarcastic.",1

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no overtly positive or negative words, no emojis, and no clear sentimental phrases. it's a straightforward statement about wolowitz leaving medical school.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be making a humorous or mocking comment about wolowitz's character. the phrase ""answering the question once and for all"" suggests that this is meant to be a definitive explanation for something that may have been unclear or debated. given that this is about a character from ""the big bang theory"" tv show, it's likely referencing a scene or storyline that provides a comical or embarrassing reason for wolowitz dropping out of medical school.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying intention appears to be humorous at wolowitz's expense. the contrast between the serious-sounding ""answering the question once and for all"" and what is likely a comedic or embarrassing revelation about wolowitz suggests sarcasm. the speaker is using a mock-serious tone to introduce what is probably a silly or unflattering reason for wolowitz's decision.

### label: sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and affirming. key phrases like ""you were right"" and ""i've never seen anything like it"" typically indicate agreement and amazement, which are generally positive.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention seems to be expressing concern or alarm about a medical condition. the phrase ""your larynx is terribly inflamed"" indicates a serious medical issue. the statement ""i've never seen anything like it"" in this context likely means the condition is unusually severe, rather than being a positive observation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface language includes some positive-sounding phrases, the overall message is conveying a serious medical concern. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention that would indicate sarcasm. the speaker appears to be straightforwardly confirming a diagnosis and expressing genuine surprise at its severity.

",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. howard is commenting on leonard apparently having a new ""bff"" (best friend forever), which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and delivery suggest a different intention:
- the use of quotation marks around ""dave"" implies skepticism or mockery.
- the phrase ""sounds like"" often introduces a sarcastic or skeptical observation.
- the abbreviation ""bff"" is often used sarcastically among adults, especially when referring to others.
- given that this is likely from the show ""the big bang theory,"" howard's character often uses sarcasm, especially when commenting on his friends' relationships.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears neutral or positive, the true intention seems to be mocking or belittling leonard's new friendship. the use of ""bff"" by an adult male talking about another adult male's friend is likely meant to be childish or derisive.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that despite the seemingly neutral surface sentiment, the underlying intention and context strongly suggest sarcasm. howard is likely mocking leonard's new friendship rather than genuinely commenting on it positively.",1

",BBT,1,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as the context isn't immediately clear, and sarcasm can be subtle:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. the speaker is suggesting an alternative activity (""let's go next door"") if the current one isn't enjoyable. the phrase ""build her a bear"" sounds like a fun, positive activity.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is likely literal rather than sarcastic. ""build-a-bear"" is a well-known store where customers can create custom stuffed animals. the speaker seems to be genuinely suggesting this as an alternative activity if the current one isn't enjoyable.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the speaker seems to be making a straightforward suggestion for an alternative activity. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory tone.

### label: not sarcastic

 LEONARD: I know, I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly confused. leonard is suggesting he might have misheard something, and he's offering an explanation that many words sound like ""yoga."" there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be expressing disbelief or reluctance in a subtle, indirect way. leonard is likely not actually confused about hearing the word ""yoga."" instead, he's probably using this statement as a way to express surprise, discomfort, or unwillingness about something related to yoga that was previously mentioned.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface neutrality with the likely underlying intention of expressing disbelief or reluctance, we can detect a mismatch. leonard is using an exaggerated claim about mishearing to indirectly communicate his true feelings. this mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine suggestion or advice, as indicated by the phrase ""why don't you just..."" this typically introduces a helpful recommendation.

step 2: true intention
however, the actual suggestion is absurd and impractical: ""lie down on the floor and swim there."" swimming on the floor is impossible, which reveals that this is not a genuine piece of advice.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contradiction between the seemingly helpful tone and the impossibility of the suggestion strongly indicates sarcasm. leonard is not actually proposing a solution but rather mocking or expressing frustration with the situation or the person he's talking to.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. penny is expressing hope about her career, using phrases like ""i hope"" and referring to her job for her ""whole life,"" which typically indicates contentment or satisfaction with a career path.

step 2: true intention
however, considering the context (assuming this is from the tv show ""the big bang theory""), penny's character is known to have aspirations beyond being a waitress. her statement likely doesn't reflect her true desires. the use of ""whole life"" in reference to a job that's often seen as temporary or transitional for many people is a key indicator that this might not be sincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention is likely the opposite. penny is probably expressing frustration or dissatisfaction with her current job situation by sarcastically stating she hopes to remain in this position forever. this mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""enjoy the ambience"" suggests a pleasant experience, which would typically be seen as positive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is quite different from the surface sentiment. penny is talking about not paying her utility bill, which resulted in her power being cut off. the ""ambience"" she refers to is actually the darkness and lack of electricity in her home. this is clearly not an enjoyable situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (enjoying ambience) and the true situation (having no power due to unpaid bills). penny is using irony to describe an unpleasant situation (having no electricity) with words that typically describe something pleasant (enjoying ambience). this is a classic example of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. the phrase ""there's no hurry"" suggests a calm, unhurried tone. encouraging someone to ""tell them more"" about a ""secret love"" could be seen as supportive or interested on the surface.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and phrasing suggest a different intention:
- ""secret love for each other"" implies the speaker is revealing something that's supposed to be private or unacknowledged.
- the encouragement to tell ""more"" about this secret love seems exaggerated or inappropriate, especially if it's truly meant to be secret.
- the overall tone seems to be teasing or mocking, rather than genuinely supportive.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of calmness and encouragement contrasts with the likely true intention of teasing or mocking. the speaker (leonard) appears to be using a seemingly positive statement to actually embarrass or put pressure on the people he's talking about. this mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""feel more alive"" generally has a positive connotation, suggesting excitement or heightened awareness. the question format with ""doesn't it?"" seems to seek agreement or confirmation of this positive feeling.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. the phrase could be genuine, expressing excitement about an experience. however, it could also be used sarcastically in a negative situation, implying the opposite of feeling ""alive"" (e.g., feeling miserable or endangered).

step 3: compare and analyze
given the limited context, there's not enough information to confidently determine if this is sarcastic. the statement could be genuine enthusiasm or subtle sarcasm depending on the situation it's referring to.

given sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory"" and the context of this quote, i'm quite confident this is sarcastic. sheldon's blunt and often unintentionally rude manner of speaking is a hallmark of his character, and this response perfectly encapsulates his sarcastic tone.

the phrase ""fairly pointless conversation"" is the key indicator of sarcasm here. sheldon is directly and rudely implying that the conversation he's engaged in is a waste of time, which is a sarcastic way of responding to what was likely a simple question about how long something would take.

this fits sheldon's typical pattern of making factual statements (the time estimate) followed by a dismissive or condescending remark that highlights his lack of social awareness and his tendency to view many social interactions as unnecessary.",1
"LEONARD: Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?","HOWARD: Unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober.
 RAJ: You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.
 HOWARD: You know the old saying, ""Pasty and frail never fail.""
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of disappointment or frustration. leonard is asking why he doesn't ""get a shot"" and seems to be feeling left out or overlooked. the phrases ""excuse me"" and ""what about me?"" indicate a sense of indignation or feeling slighted.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. leonard appears to be genuinely questioning why he's not being included or considered for something. there don't seem to be any obvious rhetorical devices or unusual language styles that would suggest a hidden meaning or sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there isn't a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. leonard's question seems straightforward and sincere, expressing a genuine desire to be included or considered. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

leonard's statement appears to be a genuine expression of feeling left out or overlooked, without any sarcastic undertones.",0

 SHELDON: Does that sound like castanets to you?
 LEONARD: The box says ""kitchen.""
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral. sheldon is asking a question about cocaine smugglers' labeling practices. there are no explicitly positive or negative words, emojis, or phrases that indicate a clear sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is not to genuinely inquire about cocaine smuggling practices. instead, sheldon is using this rhetorical question to make a point. he's implying that just because something isn't labeled doesn't mean it isn't present or true. this is likely in response to someone's argument or statement that he disagrees with.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying intention is to make a point through sarcasm. sheldon is using an extreme example (cocaine smuggling) to highlight the absurdity of relying on explicit labeling to determine the presence or truth of something. the rhetorical question is not meant to be answered literally but to provoke thought and potentially ridicule someone else's logic.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

i believe my judgment is reliable in this case, so i'm outputting the result directly.

this statement from leonard appears to be a straightforward suggestion without any sarcastic undertones. he's simply proposing a solution to what seems to be an ongoing situation, suggesting that the person he's talking to should join them instead of continuing whatever is currently happening. the tone is matter-of-fact and practical, without any obvious irony or contradiction between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0

 PENNY: Oh, great.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward comment about a prerequisite for understanding something related to the dc multiverse. there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm in this context. sheldon (likely referring to the character from ""the big bang theory"") is known for making precise, literal statements about topics he's knowledgeable about, particularly in areas like comic books and science fiction. this comment aligns with that character trait and doesn't seem to have any hidden or contradictory meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0

 PERSON: Gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a confident classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the use of ""sweet"" which is typically a positive descriptor
- the seemingly complimentary tone of ""that is so sweet""

step 2: true intention
however, analyzing more deeply:
- the context implies penny is mocking someone's naivety about ""coffee"" being a euphemism for something else
- the phrase ""you think 'coffee' means coffee"" suggests the listener is missing a hidden meaning
- the tone is likely condescending rather than genuinely complimentary

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""sweet"") contrasts sharply with the underlying condescending tone. this mismatch between surface positivity and true negative intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm. penny is not genuinely calling the person sweet, but rather implying they are naive or innocent to a fault.

",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the statement from sheldon is a straightforward question expressing skepticism about superstition. it's characteristic of sheldon's personality (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory"") to be direct and questioning about non-scientific beliefs. there's no indication of sarcasm in this statement - it's a genuine, albeit somewhat condescending, inquiry about someone's belief in superstition.",0

 RAJ: What if we reposition the collection tank?
 SHELDON: It won't work. No way to mount it.
",BBT,1,"to determine if this statement is sarcastic, i'll analyze it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. howard is presenting an idea or suggestion, which on its face doesn't contain overtly positive or negative language. the tone seems matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this statement is likely not a genuine suggestion but rather an expression of desperation or frustration. the idea of changing one's name and moving to another country to live with relatives is an extreme and impractical solution, suggesting howard is facing a significant problem he feels unable to solve through normal means.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying intention reveals a disconnect between what's being said and what's meant. the exaggerated and unrealistic nature of the suggestion, presented as if it were a reasonable idea, indicates sarcasm. howard is likely using this hyperbolic statement to emphasize his feelings of being overwhelmed or trapped in his current situation.

### label: sarcastic

the contrast between the casual presentation of an extreme idea and the implied desperation behind it points to this statement being sarcastic.",1

 LEONARD: I know, look who I'm talking to.
 SHELDON: Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
",BBT,1,"to accurately classify this statement, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears sincere and somewhat emotional. the phrase ""hardly a day goes by"" suggests frequent thoughts about something, implying it's important to leonard. there are no obvious sarcastic markers or exaggerated language.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, there's no clear reason to suspect leonard isn't being genuine. the statement could be about something truly significant in his life that he often reflects on. there's no apparent mismatch between the words and their likely intended meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the likely true intention appear to align. there are no detectable contradictions or ironic elements that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems straightforward and sincere.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

 SHELDON: People will write books about me.
 SHELDON: Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the violent imagery of ""trying to pummel you to death."" this suggests anger or aggression.

step 2: true intention
looking closer, this appears to be a response to a suggestion, likely about creating some kind of artistic representation or scene. the use of ""sure"" at the beginning and the somewhat exaggerated nature of the violent tableau suggest this isn't meant to be taken literally. instead, it seems to be an over-the-top, humorous response to whatever was proposed before.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is violent, the true intention appears to be humorous exaggeration. the contrast between the casual ""sure"" and the extreme violence described creates a comedic effect. this mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses exaggeration and contrast to create a humorous effect, typical of sarcastic responses. it's not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a witty, sarcastic retort to a previous suggestion or situation.",1

 LEONARD: Yeah, that's very comforting.
 SHELDON: Comforting is a part of leadership.
It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this line from leonard doesn't exhibit sarcasm. he's expressing genuine concern about penny not wanting him to go somewhere. the use of ""terrific"" at the beginning might seem potentially sarcastic out of context, but in this case, it's likely a response to someone else's statement before expressing his actual worry. the rest of the sentence is a straightforward expression of his thoughts about penny's wishes, without any ironic or sarcastic undertones.",0
LEONARD: What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?,"PENNY: What time is it?
 LEONARD: It's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early, but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.
",BBT,0,"for this input, i will think through it step-by-step as the context isn't immediately clear without more information:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the question ""what did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?"" indicates that someone expressed they would miss leonard, which is generally a positive sentiment.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or sarcastic intent. the question itself seems straightforward and could be a genuine request for clarification. however, the fact that leonard is asking for an explanation could suggest that he's skeptical about the sincerity of the statement or that there's some underlying tension or complexity in the relationship.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the limited information provided, there isn't enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the question appears to be a genuine inquiry rather than a sarcastic statement. while there might be underlying complexities in the relationship or conversation, the text itself does not display clear markers of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

this classification is based on the available information, but it's important to note that sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, context, and previous interactions, which are not fully provided in this brief snippet of dialogue.",0
"RAJ: Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.","HOWARD: Don't push me, Sheldon.

 SHELDON: And I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation-- be it noogies, swirlies or the classic ""Why are you hitting yourself?""
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be mocking or belittling. the phrase ""ooh, big talk"" is often used sarcastically to undermine someone's boasting or tough attitude.

step 2: the true intention here is to ridicule or embarrass the person being addressed by bringing up a past incident where they were supposedly frightened by a chicken - an animal not typically considered threatening. this creates a stark contrast between the ""big talk"" and the seemingly trivial fear.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can clearly see the hallmarks of sarcasm:
- exaggerated praise (""big talk"") followed by a contradictory statement
- use of irony to mock or belittle
- bringing up an embarrassing past event to undermine current bravado

the statement is clearly meant to be humorous and cutting at the same time, using the contrast between ""big talk"" and being ""treed by a chicken"" for comedic and sarcastic effect. therefore, the classification of ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1
"PENNY: No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.","SHELDON: like Mrs. Riley' s chicken.

 PENNY: No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
 SHELDON: Of course I'm right What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?
",BBT,0,"i think i should analyze this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. penny is suggesting they can ""always go back to being friends,"" which on the surface seems like a friendly, conciliatory statement.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm here. the statement could be genuinely meant, or it could potentially be said with a hint of resignation or disappointment if penny and the other person were in a romantic relationship that didn't work out.

step 3: compare and analyze
given only this single line of dialogue, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. the statement appears to be straightforward and lacks the typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory context.

this statement appears to be a straightforward, factual explanation about the functionality of an ical download. sheldon is describing how someone can put calendar information directly into their phone. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meaning in this statement. the tone seems matter-of-fact and informative, which is consistent with sheldon's character if this is from the tv show ""the big bang theory."" therefore, i am confident in labeling this as ""not sarcastic.""",0

 HOWARD: Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

this statement from sheldon doesn't appear to be sarcastic. in the context of sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" this kind of unexpected or seemingly out-of-character interest is actually quite typical for him. sheldon often expresses curiosity about various subcultures or experiences that might seem surprising given his usual demeanor. this statement likely represents a genuine, albeit possibly naive or inexperienced, interest in exploring a goth nightclub. there's no apparent contradiction between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0

this response appears to be a straightforward, sincere answer to a question about reading habits. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm present. the speaker (raj) is simply stating that they are not up to date on their wiki-reading because they are currently focused on reading john grisham books. this is a plausible and common scenario, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0

 LEONARD: Really?
 SHELDON: Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
Very Good.
",BBT,0,"to accurately classify this input, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. leonard firmly rejects the offer of chocolate with an emphatic ""no"" and an exclamation mark, indicating a strong refusal.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or sarcasm here. in many cases, people who love chocolate might sarcastically refuse it while actually wanting it. however, it's also entirely possible that leonard genuinely doesn't want chocolate at that moment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited context and the ambiguity of the situation, we can't confidently determine if this is sarcastic or not. the statement could be taken at face value as a genuine refusal, or it could be a sarcastic response if leonard is known to love chocolate or if there's some other contextual cue we're missing.

given this analysis, i don't have enough confidence to definitively label this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the safest classification would be:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification is made with low confidence due to the lack of context. in a real-world scenario, more context about leonard's character, the situation, or his tone of voice would be helpful in making a more accurate determination.",0
"HOWARD: Oh, you know, Goth stuff. Goth magazines, Goth music.","PERSON: So, what do you guys do?
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this response appears to be a straightforward statement without any evident sarcasm. howard is simply listing examples of ""goth stuff"" - magazines and music related to the goth subculture. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems to be a genuine, matter-of-fact description of goth-related items.",0
"SHELDON: Obviously, waitressing at The Cheese Cake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning.","PENNY: My God, she didn't!
 LEONARD: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and complimentary. words like ""obviously,"" ""complex,"" and phrases like ""requires a great deal of analysis and planning"" suggest high regard for waitressing at the cheesecake factory.

step 2: true intention
knowing this is a quote from sheldon cooper, a character known for his sarcasm and condescension towards jobs he considers beneath his intellect, the true intention is likely to belittle waitressing. the exaggerated praise for a job typically seen as straightforward is a clue to the sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the overly elaborate description of waitressing and the reality of the job, combined with sheldon's character traits, strongly indicates sarcasm. the statement is using hyperbole to mock the simplicity of waitressing, not genuinely praising its complexity.

### label: sarcastic",1
SHELDON: When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the Battlestar known as Galactica.,"LEONARD: When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context requires some careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral to bizarre. there are no clear positive or negative emotional keywords. the statement references destroying ""human toast"" on a ""battlestar known as galactica"", which are unusual concepts that don't have a clear emotional valence.

step 2: true intention
this sentence appears to be a nonsensical statement that combines elements from different science fiction universes (battlestar galactica) with everyday objects (toast) in an absurd way. the true intention seems to be humor through absurdity rather than conveying any real meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface sentiment (neutral/bizarre) with the likely intention (humor through absurdity), this statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic in the traditional sense. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with a mocking tone. this statement, while humorous, doesn't seem to be saying the opposite of what it means - it's simply nonsensical.

given this analysis, i would classify this as:

### label: not sarcastic

the statement is humorous and absurd, but it doesn't fit the typical pattern of sarcasm. it's more of a non-sequitur or surreal humor rather than sarcasm.",0

 LEONARD: Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way.
 SHELDON: How would you put it?
 LEONARD: Yeah, okay, like you said.
",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement by sheldon doesn't appear to be sarcastic. it's a straightforward expression of his opinion that aligns with his character's typical perspective. sheldon, known for his logical and often socially oblivious nature, is likely genuinely expressing his view that the effort involved in pursuing intercourse seems excessive to him.

the phrase ""awful lot of trouble"" suggests he sees it as a complex or difficult process, which is consistent with sheldon's character traits. he often struggles to understand or appreciate social and emotional aspects of human behavior, including romantic relationships and sexuality.

there's no apparent contradiction between the surface meaning and the intended meaning, which is a key element of sarcasm. sheldon is simply stating his opinion directly, without any hidden or opposite meaning.

therefore, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic."" it's a sincere, albeit characteristically blunt and socially awkward, observation from sheldon's perspective.",0

 HOWARD: No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line.
 LEONARD: Thank you!
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat negative or critical. the statement implies that the woman in question moves on quickly after relationships, while suggesting the man (presumably howard's friend) would struggle to find a new girlfriend, resorting to ""building"" one.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be a humorous jab at howard's friend's social skills or attractiveness. the comment about ""building"" a girlfriend is clearly not meant literally, but rather as a hyperbolic way of saying the friend would have extreme difficulty finding a new partner.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that howard is using exaggeration and a mock-serious tone to deliver a joke at his friend's expense. the statement isn't meant to be taken at face value, but rather to humorously highlight the perceived difference in dating prospects between the woman and howard's friend.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic. the use of exaggeration and the absurd suggestion of ""building"" a girlfriend are clear indicators of sarcastic humor.

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. keywords and phrases like ""so good,"" ""sweety,"" and ""meaty"" all convey positive appreciation. the exclamation mark after ""that was so good!"" further emphasizes enthusiasm.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, there's no clear indication that the speaker is being insincere or using rhetorical devices. the comment seems straightforward, praising something (likely food) for being both sweet and meaty. the name ""raj"" at the beginning suggests this might be part of a dialogue or conversation about a meal.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement seems to be a genuine expression of enjoyment about a food item that combines sweet and meaty flavors. there are no obvious cues for sarcasm such as exaggeration, contradiction, or contextual incongruity.

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""i'm sorry"" and ""real class act,"" which typically indicate politeness or admiration.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually negative and critical. the phrase ""fiddling with yourself in the bathtub"" is likely a euphemism for masturbation, which is generally considered a private act. calling this a ""real class act"" is not meant sincerely, but rather to mock or criticize such behavior as inappropriate or vulgar.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface politeness and seemingly positive phrase ""real class act"" are in stark contrast to the crude subject matter and the implied criticism. this mismatch between the superficial positivity and the actual negative judgment is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

 HOWARD: You mean, Bernadette?
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. the first sentence seems sarcastic or annoyed, while the second sentence is overtly positive with phrases like ""wonderful girl"" and ""really likes you.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear when we analyze the context:
- the speaker starts with ""no, i mean princess leia,"" which is clearly not meant literally.
- they immediately follow with ""of course i mean bernadette,"" indicating that the previous statement was sarcastic.
- the rest of the statement appears genuine in praising bernadette and her feelings.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the overall message is positive about bernadette, the speaker uses sarcasm at the beginning to emphasize their point. the sarcastic element is used to dismiss a possible misunderstanding before providing the sincere information.

given this analysis, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the presence of the initial sarcastic remark, even though followed by sincere statements, qualifies this overall as a sarcastic response.",1

 SHELDON: Wa- no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry.

No, we'd be suffocating.
 LEONARD: Sheldon...
 SHELDON: Don't ""Sheldon"" me. We ordered for five people, not six.
 PENNY: Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.
",BBT,1,"to properly analyze this input, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or enthusiastic. the phrase ""oh, sure"" and the suggestion ""why don't we"" typically indicate agreement or enthusiasm. the mention of an ""old-fashioned eating contest"" could be seen as a fun, nostalgic activity.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and delivery suggest this is not sheldon's true intention. the statement is likely meant to be absurd or ridiculous, especially considering sheldon's character (if this is from the big bang theory). the suggestion of an eating contest with hands behind backs is impractical and out of place, indicating it's not a genuine proposal.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the absurd suggestion reveals this statement is actually sarcastic. sheldon is likely responding to someone else's suggestion or behavior that he finds equally ridiculous or impractical. the sarcasm is used to highlight the absurdity of the situation he's responding to.

SHELDON: Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.,"LEONARD: I am.
Are you interested in physics?
 BERNADETTE: Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn't gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics.
Or ice dancing.
 LEONARD: Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.
 BERNADETTE: That's amazing.
 SHELDON: Yes.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""amazing"" to describe leonard's work. this would typically indicate praise or admiration.

step 2: true intention
however, sheldon is comparing leonard's work to a very simple elementary school science project (growing lima beans on wet paper towels). this comparison significantly diminishes the supposed impressiveness of leonard's work. the use of ""nearly as amazing"" further emphasizes this belittling comparison.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""amazing"") is completely undercut by the comparison to a trivial child's experiment. this stark contrast between the surface praise and the actual insulting comparison is a classic structure of sarcasm. sheldon is not genuinely praising leonard's work but rather mocking it by equating it to something extremely basic and unimpressive.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is using superficially positive language to actually criticize and belittle leonard's work in a mocking way.",1
"HOWARD: Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.","SHELDON: That's why Leonard does it.
 PENNY: Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?

 PENNY: Thank you.
 SHELDON: And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves: ""What is physics?"" Oh, balls. It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece.
",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

for this input, i can confidently provide the label without going through the step-by-step process, as the phrase is a common idiom that doesn't contain sarcasm.

the expression ""i got a bone to pick with you"" is a straightforward idiom meaning that the speaker (howard) has an issue, complaint, or disagreement they want to discuss with the person they're addressing. it's typically used to initiate a serious or potentially confrontational conversation.

this phrase is direct and doesn't involve any irony, exaggeration, or mismatch between surface meaning and true intention that would indicate sarcasm. it's a literal statement of howard's intent to discuss a problem, so it's classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"BERNADETTE: Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.","BERNADETTE: Should I give him another chance?
 LEONARD: It's up to you. He didn't call your experiment stupid.
 BERNADETTE: Come here, tushy face.
 LEONARD: ""Tushy face. "" Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of enthusiasm about leonard's experiment. bernadette is describing the interference pattern as ""so cool,"" which is consistent with her character's scientific background and interest. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement. the tone seems sincere and excited about sharing a scientific observation with raj.",0
"PERSON: I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.","PERSON: Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.
 PENNY: Oh,it's not a problem.
",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the speaker is expressing a genuine concern about leonard's emotional state and the potential risks of allowing someone in that condition to operate heavy machinery. the language is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the speaker seems to be sincerely explaining their reasoning for not asking leonard to perform a task involving heavy machinery, which is a reasonable safety consideration.",0
"PENNY: Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.","BERNADETTE: So, what should we talk about?
 HOWARD: Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?
",BBT,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. penny is saying they don't need to discuss something further, indicating that leonard has already explained it sufficiently. the phrase ""covered it pretty well"" suggests a positive assessment of leonard's explanation.

step 2: however, when we look deeper, there are potential clues that this might not be entirely sincere:
1. the phrase ""oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore"" could be a way to abruptly end a conversation, possibly out of frustration or embarrassment.
2. saying leonard ""covered it pretty well in the car"" might be an attempt to avoid further discussion, regardless of how well it was actually explained.
3. without more context, it's hard to determine if penny is genuinely satisfied with leonard's explanation or if she's trying to deflect or move on from an uncomfortable topic.

step 3: while there are elements that could suggest sarcasm, they are not strong enough to conclusively label this statement as sarcastic. the statement could be genuine, especially without more context or information about penny's tone or body language.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i would lean towards labeling this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this judgment is made with less than 90% confidence due to the potential for subtle sarcasm that might be more apparent with additional context.",0
LEONARD: Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?,"SHELDON: My new computer came with Windows 7.
 SHELDON: Windows 7 is much more use r- friendly than Windows Vista.
 SHELDON: I don't like that.
",BBT,0,"to analyze this sentence for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of concern or skepticism. the phrase ""don't you think..."" suggests leonard is questioning someone's decision. the word ""overreaction"" implies that leonard believes the action (looking for a new city) is excessive compared to whatever prompted it.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. leonard appears to be genuinely questioning whether the action of looking for a new city to live in is an appropriate response to whatever situation prompted it. there don't seem to be any clear rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would indicate a hidden meaning or sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
in this case, the surface sentiment and the true intention appear to be aligned. leonard seems to be sincerely expressing his opinion that searching for a new city to live in might be an overreaction to a situation. there's no evident mismatch between what's said and what's meant, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of leonard's opinion without any sarcastic undertones.",0
"HOWARD: I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.","HOWARD: There's a 39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's.

 SHELDON: Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the statement appears to be making a generalization about jewish people's food preferences. the tone seems matter-of-fact, without obvious emotional keywords or sentimental phrases. there are no emojis or clear indicators of sarcasm on the surface.

step 2: true intention
the statement is likely meant to be humorous rather than a serious assertion. it's an overgeneralization that plays on the cultural stereotype of jewish people enjoying chinese food, particularly on holidays when other restaurants might be closed. the phrase ""jews always go with chinese food"" is an exaggeration that hints at a joking tone.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment doesn't immediately scream sarcasm, the exaggerated nature of the statement and the play on cultural stereotypes suggest a humorous, slightly sarcastic intent. it's not biting or harsh sarcasm, but rather a mild, playful form that relies on shared cultural understanding.

given this analysis, i would classify this statement as:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses gentle sarcasm to make a humorous point about cultural habits, even if it's not overtly sarcastic in tone.",1
"PENNY: Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.","SHELDON: Hello.
 PENNY: Hello
 SHELDON: Alright dispense with the friendlt banter
 SHELDON: I believe you know why I'm here.
",BBT,1,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be serious and somewhat paranoid. the statement talks about alien overlords, studying humans, and discovering weaknesses, which on the surface seems like a genuine conspiracy theory or science fiction scenario.

step 2: true intention
however, this is likely not the true intention. the context suggests this is probably a humorous or lighthearted conversation. the exaggerated nature of the statement (alien overlords, studying weaknesses) is typically used in jokes or sarcastic comments, especially when discussing mundane topics or explaining someone's behavior.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, we can see a clear discrepancy. the statement is purposely over-the-top and unlikely to be a sincere belief. it's using hyperbole and absurd scenarios (alien overlords) to make a point or joke about something or someone's behavior in a playful, exaggerated way.

given this analysis, we can conclude that this statement is indeed sarcastic. it's using an outlandish scenario to humorously comment on something or someone's actions.

 RAJ: Well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision.
 SHELDON: There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this question appears to be a straightforward inquiry without any apparent sarcastic elements. howard is simply asking why certain items aren't kept in the bathroom, which is a common and practical question in everyday life. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradictory meanings that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems neutral and the question appears to be asked at face value.",0
"PENNY: Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.","PENNY: Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.

 PERSON: I see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited?
 SHELDON: You said we were invited.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to break it down step-by-step. the sentence appears to be a straightforward clarification or correction of a previous misunderstanding. penny is explaining that she's inviting the other person to come with her to stan lee's house. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meanings in this statement. the tone seems sincere and informative rather than sarcastic.",0
PENNY: There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one.,"SHELDON: Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?

 LEONARD: Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.
 HOWARD: They were closing up. We got this whole box for 60 bucks.
 LEONARD: We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
",BBT,1,"to analyze this statement for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears to be concerned or helpful. penny is asking if there's a new girlfriend and suggesting that one might be needed.

step 2 (true intention):
looking deeper, this statement is likely not genuinely helpful. the phrase ""you might need one"" implies criticism or mockery of the person's current relationship status or behavior. it suggests that the person's current situation is so bad that they need to replace their partner or find a new one.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
while the surface appears to be a question and suggestion, the underlying tone is mocking and critical. the disconnect between the seemingly helpful surface and the actually critical intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

 SHELDON: I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics.
 SHELDON: All right, I'll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honoring this year?
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""oh, i'm so glad you asked it like that."" this suggests enthusiasm and appreciation for the way something was asked.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and delivery suggest a different intention:
- the abrupt ""you."" at the end feels dismissive or annoyed.
- the exaggerated gladness (""so glad"") combined with specifying ""you asked it like that"" hints at insincerity.
- this seems like a response to an unwanted or poorly phrased question, with leonard expressing irritation rather than genuine gladness.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface positive sentiment contrasts sharply with the likely true intention of expressing annoyance or frustration. this mismatch between the stated sentiment and the probable true feeling is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1

 SHELDON: For the record, giant rats are possible.
",BBT,1,"### label: not sarcastic

while leonard's statement does have a slightly exasperated tone, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. let's break it down:

1. surface sentiment: the statement expresses frustration or weariness with the current topic of conversation. leonard is requesting a change of subject to something more relatable or interesting.

2. true intention: leonard genuinely wants to change the topic of conversation to something he considers more relevant or engaging. the phrase ""vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet"" suggests he finds the current topic too abstract or disconnected from everyday life.

3. analysis: there's no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. leonard is being direct about his desire to change the subject, using a bit of hyperbole (""life as we know it on this planet"") to emphasize how far removed he feels the current conversation is from normal topics.

the statement is more of a plea or request with a touch of exasperation, rather than sarcasm. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with the intent to mock or criticize. in this case, leonard is being straightforward about his wishes, even if he's expressing them in a somewhat dramatic way.

therefore, the statement is classified as not sarcastic.",0
"SHELDON: Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.","RAJ: Oh, there it is: now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.

this statement by sheldon appears to be a straightforward declaration of his intention to get a drink. given sheldon's character (if this is from ""the big bang theory""), he is known for his literal and direct communication style. there are no indicators of sarcasm or hidden meaning in this statement. he is simply announcing what he plans to do, which is typical of his character's behavior.",0

 SHELDON: Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.
 LEONARD: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
 HOWARD: Yeah, since when do you take walks?
",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, so i'll explain my reasoning:

sheldon's statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. it's a typical example of sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory"" - he's sharing scientific information he's read, expressing his genuine interest in serotonin, and making a somewhat quirky comparison between his love for serotonin and refreshing beverages. 

the tone is earnest and informative, which is consistent with sheldon's character. he's not using irony or saying the opposite of what he means. instead, he's straightforwardly explaining why he wants to go for a walk after a meal, citing scientific reasons that align with his personality traits (love of facts and neurochemistry).

the ""bye-bye"" at the end further reinforces that he's sincerely leaving to go for his walk, not making a sarcastic comment.

therefore, this statement can be confidently classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the statement appears to be a straightforward question without any obvious sarcastic elements. howard seems to be genuinely inquiring about someone's intentions to walk up and down stairs, likely in a confused or questioning tone. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone in this short sentence. the context is limited, but based on the information provided, it comes across as a literal question rather than a sarcastic remark.",0

",BBT,0,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and polite. key phrases like ""very thoughtful"" express appreciation, and ""i think i'll finish my coffee first"" seems like a gentle decline of an offer.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. there's no obvious mismatch or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm. the speaker appears to be genuinely acknowledging someone's thoughtfulness while politely prioritizing finishing their coffee.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. the statement seems straightforward and sincere, without any indicators of irony or sarcasm.

 PERSON: Hey.
 SHELDON: Hello.
 PERSON: Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.
 SHELDON: Yes.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with words like ""fondest hope"" and ""bitchin'"" (slang for excellent or impressive) used to describe einstein's supposed expectations for the laser.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to create humor by juxtaposing the formal, scientific nature of einstein's work with modern, casual slang. it's highly unlikely that einstein would have used or even known the term ""bitchin'"" in 1917, let alone hope for his theoretical work to result in something described that way.

step 3: analysis and inference
the disconnect between the formal scientific context and the use of modern slang creates an absurd and humorous situation. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the speaker (sheldon) is saying something he doesn't literally mean for comedic effect. the sarcasm lies in attributing a colloquial, anachronistic desire to a renowned scientist in a historical context.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic, using humor to highlight the contrast between serious scientific work and casual modern language.",1

this dialogue line from leonard appears to be a straightforward, genuine inquiry without any sarcastic undertones. the character is asking about ongoing research and then inquiring about something else (""so what is all this?""). there are no linguistic cues or context provided that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems neutral and inquisitive, typical of normal conversation, rather than conveying any hidden or contrary meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0

 RAJ: - Why?
 SHELDON: Because…
 RAJ: Yes?
 SHELDON: It's my office.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. sheldon is conceding to something (""all right, all right"") and then making a statement about someone being able to buy their own desk. there are no overtly positive or negative words, but the repetition of ""all right"" suggests some reluctance or frustration.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention with certainty. however, the repetition of ""all right, all right"" suggests sheldon is giving in to something he may not fully agree with. the statement about buying a desk could be literal, or it could be a way of expressing that he's no longer willing to help or accommodate someone.

step 3: analysis and inference
while there's a hint of potential frustration or reluctance in sheldon's tone, there's not enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the statement appears to be straightforward, even if delivered with some reluctance. without more context or a clear mismatch between the surface meaning and true intention, we can't definitively classify this as sarcasm.

 LEONARD: No, Penny kissed me.
",BBT,0,"i'll think this through step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. howard is offering a possible explanation for what might be an awkward or unexpected kiss situation. the tone seems understanding and non-judgmental, even relating it to his own experiences with his mother.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be humorous or sarcastic. the suggestion that accidental lip kisses happen ""all the time"" with his mother is likely an exaggeration used for comedic effect. this comparison between an accidental romantic kiss and frequent mishaps with a parent is deliberately absurd.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears straightforward and helpful, the true intention is to make a joke by drawing an inappropriate parallel. the humor derives from the incongruity between the seemingly sincere tone and the ridiculous content of the statement. this mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 PENNY: Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""i'm just glad"" expresses happiness, and ""found yourself a keeper"" is typically a compliment, suggesting the person has found a good romantic partner.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, the phrase ""finally found"" could imply a long wait or previous unsuccessful relationships, which might be a subtle dig. the word ""just"" could also potentially downplay the sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, there are subtle hints that could indicate sarcasm. however, without additional context or tone indicators, it's not possible to definitively say this is sarcastic. the statement could be genuinely meant, especially if said by a close friend or family member.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i'll err on the side of taking the statement at face value.

 LEONARD: So...you and Zack again, huh?
 PENNY: Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
 PERSON: Were we here earlier?
 PENNY: Okay, we should, we should go.
 PERSON: Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. howard is informing someone about ""science dudes"" wanting to talk science and offering topic suggestions like rocks, dinosaurs, and beavers. the tone seems casual and informative.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are several clues that suggest sarcasm:
1. the use of ""science dudes"" instead of more respectful terms like scientists or researchers.
2. the oversimplification of scientific topics to ""rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver"" suggests a mocking tone towards these subjects.
3. the phrase ""our friend the beaver"" is particularly telling, as it's an oddly informal and patronizing way to refer to a scientific subject.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment doesn't immediately scream sarcasm, the underlying tone and word choices strongly suggest a sarcastic intent. howard appears to be belittling both the scientists and the scientific topics, implying that these conversations would be simplistic or boring.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that despite the seemingly neutral surface, the statement is indeed sarcastic in its true intention.",1
"SHELDON: In the bedrooms of ten-year- old girls, where they belong.","PERSON: Wow, this place is awesome.
 PERSON: Where do they keep the Archies?
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the statement is matter-of-fact, referring to where certain items ""belong."" there are no overtly positive or negative keywords, emojis, or sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be dismissive or derogatory. by saying these items belong ""in the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls,"" sheldon is likely implying that they are childish, immature, or not worthy of serious consideration by adults. this suggests a condescending attitude towards the items in question.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the underlying intention appears to be mocking or belittling. this discrepancy between the straightforward statement and the implied judgment is a common characteristic of sarcasm. sheldon is using a seemingly factual statement to convey a negative opinion.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a subtle form of sarcasm to express derision or contempt for whatever items are being discussed, by associating them with young girls' bedrooms.",1

 LEONARD: She didn't tell you?
 PERSON: She told me she dated a guy named Leonard.
 PERSON: Who would have thought it was you?
 LEONARD: Who else would it be?
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this case isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems uncertain or hesitant at first (""i don't know""), then shifts to a more agreeable tone (""yeah, sure. why not you?""). the words themselves don't indicate strong positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the context is unclear, but the speaker seems to be responding to a suggestion or question. the phrase ""somebody bigger and..."" suggests they were initially thinking of someone else. the sudden shift to ""yeah, sure. why not you?"" feels abrupt and potentially insincere. this could be a reluctant agreement or a dismissive response masked as agreement.

step 3: analysis and inference
the contrast between the initial hesitation and the seemingly enthusiastic agreement at the end suggests possible sarcasm. the speaker appears to be agreeing in a way that might not be genuine, possibly to end the conversation or avoid conflict.

### label: sarcastic

while there's some ambiguity without more context, the sudden shift in tone and the potentially insincere agreement suggest this is likely a sarcastic response.",1

 RAJ: Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be serious or somewhat negative. sheldon is stating that they are ""no longer a justice league"" and that they ""have no choice"" but to switch costumes. the use of ""obviously"" suggests a matter-of-fact tone.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, this statement is likely not meant to be taken literally. the contrast between the serious superhero reference (justice league) and the childish, comical alternative (muppet baby costumes) creates a humorous juxtaposition. this is characteristic of sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" who often makes deadpan statements that are unintentionally funny.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while sheldon's surface tone is serious, the content of his statement is absurd and comedic. the juxtaposition of adult superheroes with children's characters (muppet babies) in a seemingly serious context is a classic setup for sarcasm or deadpan humor. sheldon's character often doesn't intend to be sarcastic, but his literal interpretations and socially awkward statements often come across as such.

### label: sarcastic

the statement, while not intentionally sarcastic from sheldon's perspective, would likely be perceived as sarcastic by the audience due to its absurd content delivered in a serious manner. this fits the definition of situational or dramatic irony, which is often classified under the broader umbrella of sarcasm in many contexts.",1

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this line from sheldon (likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory"") doesn't appear to be sarcastic. sheldon is known for his direct and literal communication style, and this statement seems to be a straightforward attempt at negotiation or persuasion. he's acknowledging the other person's loyalty but then offering to ""up the ante,"" which means to increase the stakes or make a better offer. this is a sincere attempt to change someone's mind, not a sarcastic comment.",0

 SHELDON: Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?
",BBT,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be straightforward and somewhat humorous. raj is making two points, one about a conversation topic and another about the effects of alcohol. there are no obvious sarcastic keywords or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. raj is likely making a genuine, albeit humorous, observation about a conversation and his current state due to drinking mimosas. the use of ""little brown ass"" is likely self-deprecating humor rather than sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement is humorous and perhaps a bit crude, but it doesn't contain the hallmarks of sarcasm such as saying one thing but meaning the opposite.

### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this assessment without needing to break it down step-by-step. the statement by leonard appears to be a straightforward, sincere comment about making progress in identifying someone's problem. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meaning. the tone seems helpful and matter-of-fact, which is consistent with the literal meaning of the words.",0

 PENNY: Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls ""action.""
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. sheldon is saying ""you taught me something,"" which typically indicates appreciation for learning. the phrase ""who would have thought it?"" suggests surprise or amazement at this occurrence.

step 2: true intention
however, this is sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" a character known for his arrogance and belief in his superior intelligence. the phrase ""who would have thought it?"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is unexpected or unlikely. in sheldon's case, he's likely implying that it's surprising or unusual for someone else to teach him anything, given his perceived intellectual superiority.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears positive, sheldon's character context and the use of the rhetorical question ""who would have thought it?"" strongly suggest that he's not genuinely amazed or appreciative. instead, he's likely using sarcasm to downplay the idea that someone else could teach him something, reinforcing his own sense of superiority.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

 LEONARD: Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.
 LEONARD: She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be mildly negative or dismissive. sheldon is questioning the length and importance of the dinner conversation about research by comparing it to a fast food drive-thru experience.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to belittle or mock the idea of having an entire dinner dedicated to discussing someone's research. by comparing it to a quick fast food experience, sheldon is implying that the research isn't substantial enough to warrant a full dinner conversation.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention, but the way it's expressed is exaggerated and uses a mocking comparison. this exaggeration and the use of a rhetorical question followed by an absurd comparison (research dinner vs. fast food drive-thru) are classic indicators of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as:

 PERSON: Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.
 SHELDON: Hello. Hey.
 RAJ: Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
 PERSON: Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.
",BBT,0,"let's think through this step-by-step, as the context isn't immediately clear:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the use of ""forboded"" (likely meant to be ""forbade"") implies a restrictive or controlling action. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is unclear without more context. however, the statement seems absurd or illogical. the idea of forbidding someone to have sex while they're sleeping doesn't make sense, as sleeping people aren't typically engaging in sexual activity anyway.

step 3: compare and analyze
the disconnect between the seemingly serious tone and the illogical content suggests this might be a sarcastic or humorous statement. the absurdity of forbidding a sleeping person from having sex could be interpreted as a joke or a sarcastic comment on controlling behavior.

given this analysis, i'm leaning towards classifying this as sarcastic, but with less than 90% confidence due to the lack of broader context.

 AMY: Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking.
 PERSON: So, Penny, Leonard tells me you're an actress. That must be pretty exciting.
",BBT,1,"given the context and tone of the input, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the opening phrase ""oh, yeah, yeah. it's real great"" initially suggests a positive sentiment. the speaker seems to be expressing enthusiasm about their day.

step 2: true intention
however, as we continue reading, it becomes clear that penny's day was actually quite disappointing and potentially embarrassing. she drove to an audition expecting it to be for a cat food commercial, but it turned out to be for pornography instead. this reveals a stark contrast between the initial positive statement and the actual events described.

step 3: analysis and inference
the mismatch between the initial positive statement (""it's real great"") and the clearly negative experience described afterwards is a classic indicator of sarcasm. penny is using verbal irony to emphasize how bad her day actually was. the exaggerated positive opening followed by the unexpected and undesirable outcome creates a sarcastic tone.

 PERSON: Hey, you.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""got to be fun for you"" initially seems positive, but it's immediately followed by a graphic and potentially disgusting description (""suck the saliva out of your sister's mouth""). the tone seems mocking and confrontational.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to express disgust and make the listener uncomfortable. howard is likely not actually asking if this is fun, but rather pointing out how unpleasant and awkward the situation is. the graphic description is deliberately used to emphasize the discomfort.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment starts with a seemingly positive phrase (""that's got to be fun for you"") but quickly turns negative. the true intention is to express disgust and discomfort. the stark contrast between the initial positive framing and the clearly negative content that follows is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

 PENNY: Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?
 AMY: Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.
",BBT,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""it's a great time to be alive"" typically expresses enthusiasm and appreciation for the current era.

step 2: however, this sentence is likely to be sarcastic due to several factors:
1. the name ""penny"" suggests this is dialogue from a script or conversation.
2. the question ""isn't it?"" at the end invites agreement in a way that often signals sarcasm.
3. without more context, this statement seems overly broad and enthusiastic, which can be a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 3: comparing the surface positivity with the likely true intention, there's a clear mismatch. the speaker is probably using irony to express the opposite of what they're saying - that it's actually not a great time to be alive.

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. amy uses phrases like ""you're the most fun person i know,"" which on its face is a strong compliment and positive statement.

step 2: true intention
however, there are some clues that suggest the true intention might be different:
1. the statement starts with ""i'm not saying that you're not fun,"" which is a double negative. this often indicates an attempt to soften a potentially negative statement.
2. the contrast between the first part (""i'm not saying that you're not fun"") and the second part (""you're the most fun person i know"") is quite stark, which can be a sign of sarcasm.
3. the exaggeration in ""the most fun person i know"" could be interpreted as overstatement for sarcastic effect.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is positive, the structure of the statement and the use of contrast and potential exaggeration suggest that amy might not actually believe the person is very fun at all. the statement seems to use irony to convey the opposite of what is literally said.

 PENNY: Yeah, it was.
 BERNADETTE: Leonard's really one of a kind.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be critical or skeptical. key phrases like ""a bit heavy-handed"" suggest amy is questioning or criticizing something, likely the action of ""holding a snowflake"" while making a statement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out an exaggeration or overly dramatic gesture. amy is implying that the act of holding a snowflake while making a statement is too obvious or exaggerated a metaphor, perhaps mocking the attempt at symbolism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface criticism with the implied mockery of dramatization, there's a subtle mismatch. amy isn't just criticizing; she's using understatement (""a bit"") to highlight what she sees as an overly dramatic gesture. this subtle use of understatement to emphasize the opposite point is a common sarcastic technique.

the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or disbelief. the question format and the use of ""i'm sorry"" as an interjection suggest that person3 is taken aback by the information about sheldon buying a loom and learning to weave.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this question is likely genuine curiosity or amazement. there's no obvious indicator of sarcasm or mockery. the speaker seems to be seeking confirmation about an unexpected piece of information regarding sheldon's actions.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the question seems to be a straightforward expression of surprise about an unusual activity (buying a loom and learning to weave) undertaken by sheldon, who is presumably known for other types of behavior.

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. penny starts by saying she's not concerned about who hangs out with whom and doesn't have a problem with leonard's new girlfriend. this seems positive. however, she then makes a comment about the girlfriend wearing too much makeup, which is negative. she then abruptly changes topics to cute shoes, but follows with a hyperbolic statement about renting her womb.

step 2: true intention
penny's true intention seems to be expressing jealousy and discomfort with leonard's new girlfriend, despite her claims to the contrary. the abrupt topic changes and exaggerated statements suggest she's not being entirely truthful about her feelings. the comment about renting her womb is clearly hyperbole used for dramatic effect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (not being concerned) contradicts the underlying tone of jealousy and discomfort. penny uses sarcasm to indirectly express her true feelings. the exaggerated statement about renting her womb is a clear indicator of sarcastic humor.

 RAJ: Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about.
 RAJ: Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other.
 BERNADETTE: You guys ready to order?
",BBT,1,"to properly analyze this input, i'll go through the steps as my confidence is not high enough for an immediate judgment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. sheldon is requesting medication, including penicillin (an antibiotic), ipecac (to induce vomiting), and a mint. the combination of these items doesn't immediately suggest a positive or negative sentiment, but the inclusion of a vomiting agent could be seen as slightly negative.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be humor rather than a genuine request. the combination of items sheldon is asking for is unusual and somewhat absurd:
- penicillin suggests he's treating an infection
- syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting is contradictory to taking medication
- adding a mint at the end of this serious medical request is unexpected and trivial

this unusual combination suggests that sheldon is either making a joke or demonstrating his eccentric personality rather than making a serious request.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention appears to be humorous. the statement itself isn't directly sarcastic - sheldon isn't saying the opposite of what he means. instead, it's an example of situational humor or absurdism. 

sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with a mocking or contemptuous tone. this statement doesn't fit that definition precisely.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of extreme concern or distress. the phrase ""the words they'll be carving into my tombstone"" suggests a very serious, even life-threatening situation.

step 2: true intention
in reality, this is a quote from sheldon cooper, a character known for his germaphobia and exaggerated reactions in the tv show ""the big bang theory"". the true intention is to highlight sheldon's overreaction to someone drinking from leonard's glass, which is a minor, harmless occurrence for most people.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the extreme discrepancy between the surface sentiment (treating drinking from someone else's glass as a grave, tombstone-worthy event) and the actual trivial nature of the situation creates a clear sarcastic effect. the statement is deliberately exaggerated for comedic effect, mocking sheldon's obsessive personality.

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and casual. the phrase ""casual, la-di-da approach"" suggests a relaxed, easygoing attitude.

step 2: however, this statement is clearly sarcastic when we consider the cultural context and common stereotypes. jewish mothers are often stereotypically portrayed as being very involved, worried, and overprotective of their children, especially their sons. the phrase ""la-di-da"" is often used mockingly to describe something as pretentiously casual or carefree.

step 3: the stark contrast between the stereotype of jewish mothers and the description given here is the key to the sarcasm. howard is using irony by saying the exact opposite of what is commonly believed or expected, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

therefore, this statement is definitely sarcastic. howard is humorously pointing out how involved and concerned jewish mothers typically are by sarcastically stating the opposite.",1

without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcastic intent. the statement seems to be a straightforward comparison or explanation. however, given that this is attributed to sheldon (possibly referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory""), there might be more to this statement than appears on the surface.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there isn't enough information to confidently label this as sarcastic. the statement on its own doesn't contain typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradiction. without additional context about what event is being referred to or the full conversation, it's safest to assume this is a literal statement.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a possibility that this could be part of a larger sarcastic context, based solely on the information provided, the statement appears to be a straightforward comparison rather than a sarcastic remark.",0

",BBT,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""oh, yeah, that can only be good for you"" seems to express approval or a positive outlook on the situation.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly the opposite. the speaker is using verbal irony to express that this situation is actually problematic or potentially harmful for the person being addressed. the phrase ""can only be good for you"" is an exaggeration used sarcastically to emphasize how bad the situation really is.

step 3: the stark contrast between the surface positive sentiment and the actual negative implication is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is using a seemingly positive statement to convey a negative opinion about the situation of someone's girlfriend and ex-girlfriend hanging out together, which is typically seen as an awkward or potentially troublesome scenario.

therefore, the statement is decidedly sarcastic.",1

 AMY: Have you considered massage?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. sheldon uses phrases like ""i'd like to"" and ""i relish the thought,"" which typically indicate enthusiasm or enjoyment.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly negative. several clues indicate this:
1. sheldon explicitly states he's responding ""sarcastically.""
2. the context (sheldon's character is known for disliking physical contact) contradicts the surface sentiment.
3. the exaggerated language (""relish the thought"") is a common sarcastic device.
4. the idea of a ""stranger covering my body with oil"" is something sheldon would typically find uncomfortable, not enjoyable.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. this, combined with sheldon's explicit mention of sarcasm, makes it unambiguously sarcastic.

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic.""",1

 LEONARD: There's a reciprocity clause.

 RAJ: Well, that seems fair.
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first. sheldon is congratulating someone and welcoming them. he's providing them with items like an id card, key, and lapel pin, which seems helpful and inclusive.

step 2: true intention
however, the last sentence reveals sheldon's true intention. by saying ""which leonard was too cool to wear,"" sheldon is implying that leonard thought he was above wearing the lapel pin, and is criticizing this behavior. this suggests that sheldon doesn't actually think leonard is ""cool"" for not wearing it, but rather disapproves of his choice.

step 3: analysis and inference
the contrast between the initial welcoming tone and the final critical comment about leonard indicates sarcasm. sheldon is using the word ""cool"" ironically to express his disapproval of leonard's choice not to wear the lapel pin. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning (leonard being ""cool"") is the opposite of the intended meaning (leonard being foolish or disrespectful for not wearing the pin).

 BERNADETTE: What?!
 RAJ: Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is extremely positive. key phrases like ""cutie pie"" and ""any girl would be lucky to have you"" express strong affection and praise. the exclamation marks also reinforce the enthusiastic tone.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to definitively determine if there's a hidden intention behind these words. in many cases, such effusive praise could be genuine, especially if bernadette is speaking to a close friend or family member. however, the extreme nature of the compliments could potentially be seen as over-the-top or insincere in certain contexts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the possibility of sarcasm exists due to the somewhat exaggerated nature of the compliments, there isn't enough contextual evidence to conclusively label this as sarcastic. in many social situations, such enthusiastic encouragement could be completely sincere.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the possibility of genuine encouragement, i would lean towards classifying this as not sarcastic.

 PENNY: The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""i could so see you being the face of..."" typically suggests a compliment or positive association.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we consider the complete phrase ""being the face of hemorrhoids."" hemorrhoids are a painful and embarrassing medical condition. no one would genuinely want to be associated with or be ""the face"" of such a condition.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see a clear mismatch between the seemingly positive structure of the sentence and the negative implication of being associated with hemorrhoids. this mismatch is a hallmark of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

"SHELDON: All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, ""Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?""","SHELDON: What are you doing?
 LEONARD: Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
 SHELDON: It's 8:00 in the morning in Mumbai. 
How can she have dinner?
 LEONARD: Fine, whatever. 
Priya will be having breakfast.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly humorous. sheldon is explaining a concept and suggesting a potential term ""dinfast date,"" while also warning about the possibility of mockery for using such a term.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to be humorous and slightly mocking. sheldon is creating a hypothetical scenario where using the term ""dinfast"" would lead to ridicule. his example of peer-based mocking, ""hey, leonard, how was your dinfast with priya last night?"" is delivered in a way that's meant to be funny and slightly teasing.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment isn't overtly sarcastic, the true intention reveals a subtle form of sarcasm. sheldon is using the made-up term ""dinfast"" and the hypothetical mockery scenario to indirectly poke fun at the idea of labeling this not-quite-dinner date. the sarcasm is gentle and wrapped in sheldon's characteristic literal and analytical style.

### label: sarcastic

the subtle use of humor, the creation of a ridiculous term, and the imagined scenario of mockery all point to a gentle form of sarcasm, which is characteristic of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory.""",1

 PENNY: Put the corsage on her.
 LEONARD: When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain why:

1. surface sentiment: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative, with amy making a statement about someone touching her and an object being placed on her wrist.

2. true intention: the phrase ""copping a feel"" is a colloquial expression for inappropriate touching or groping. amy's casual and direct way of addressing this suggests she's not actually upset or offended, but rather making light of the situation.

3. analysis: the sarcasm comes from amy's nonchalant attitude towards what would typically be considered inappropriate behavior. she's using humor to defuse a potentially uncomfortable situation, implying that the touching is so obvious and prolonged that it's gone beyond a simple interaction to ""copping a feel."" the casual tone contrasts with the seriousness of unwanted touching, creating a sarcastic effect.

the sarcasm here is subtle but present in the way amy addresses a potentially serious situation with humor and casualness, subverting expectations of how someone might typically react to unwanted touching. therefore, the statement is classified as sarcastic.",1

 SHELDON: You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
 RAJ: I don't know if I want to play anymore.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: on the surface, sheldon appears to be making a sincere statement about the popularity of dungeons & dragons and expressing concern for the game's future.

step 2: however, the true intention is to mock the idea that not having a girlfriend is a valid reason to stop playing d&d. sheldon's exaggerated concern (""this game's in serious trouble"") is actually highlighting how ridiculous he finds this notion.

step 3: the contrast between the surface sentiment (concern for the game) and the true intention (mocking the idea) is what creates the sarcasm. sheldon is using verbal irony to make his point, saying the opposite of what he really means.

the sarcastic tone is typical of sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" who often uses dry humor and sarcasm, especially when discussing social norms that he finds illogical.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic.",1

 LEONARD: Yeah, every night for the last month.
 PENNY: Wow, can't believe he has a girlfriend.
 SHELDON: Me neither.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. keywords like ""fun news"" and the mention of expensive gifts (diamond earrings and leasing a car) suggest a positive tone. there are no obvious negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the phrase ""here's some other fun news"" could be interpreted as sarcastic, especially if delivered with a certain tone. the extravagance of the gifts (diamond earrings and a leased car) might be seen as excessive or foolish behavior, particularly if raj and emily's relationship is not very serious or long-term.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the potential for sarcasm lies in the speaker's attitude towards raj's actions. if howard genuinely thinks this is good news, it's not sarcastic. however, if he's implying that raj is being overly generous or foolish, it could be sarcastic.

given the context of the characters (assuming this is from ""the big bang theory""), howard often uses sarcasm when commenting on raj's romantic endeavors. the exaggerated nature of the gifts also leans towards a sarcastic interpretation.

### label: sarcastic

while there's some ambiguity without hearing the tone or having more context, the combination of the introductory phrase ""here's some other fun news"" and the extravagant nature of the gifts suggests that howard is likely being sarcastic about raj's actions.",0
HOWARD: Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you.,"HOWARD: Wow.

 HOWARD: Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.
 PENNY: I can't believe you're engaged to my friend.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral or even positive with the use of the word ""smart"" at the beginning.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly sarcastic. howard is pointing out the absurdity of whispering to avoid a deaf person hearing, which is obviously impossible. the statement is meant to highlight the illogical nature of whispering in this context.

step 3: comparing the surface positive ""smart"" with the clearly illogical action it's describing, we can confidently conclude this is sarcasm. howard is using irony to mock the idea of whispering to avoid being heard by someone who can't hear anyway.

therefore, the statement is definitely sarcastic.",1

 SHELDON: Would you like to see the list?
 PENNY: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. sheldon is talking about adding someone back to a list, which on its own isn't particularly emotional.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear with the last sentence: ""it's on a five and a quarter inch floppy."" this is a heavily outdated storage medium, which is being presented as if it's a current, normal thing to use. this stark contrast between the outdated technology and the casual way it's mentioned is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 3: the sarcasm comes from the juxtaposition of treating an extremely outdated technology (5.25"" floppy disk) as if it's a normal, current method of data storage. this is likely meant to emphasize how slow or inefficient the process of getting back on the list would be, or to mock the person for getting off the list in the first place.

the character sheldon from ""the big bang theory"" is also known for his dry, often sarcastic humor, which further supports this interpretation.

therefore, the final label is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1

 HOWARD: Little bit.
 LEONARD: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward, serious observation about someone's behavior. the key phrase ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself"" suggests accusation or criticism. there are no obvious sentimental phrases, emojis, or clear indicators of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
considering this is a quote from sheldon (likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory""), we need to consider the context and character. sheldon is known for his direct, often blunt statements that can come across as critical or judgmental, but are usually meant literally rather than sarcastically. the statement seems to be a direct observation or criticism about someone's hypocrisy or lack of self-awareness.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy. the statement is likely meant to be taken at face value - a critical observation about someone's behavior. sheldon's character typically doesn't employ sarcasm, preferring direct communication.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. sheldon uses words like ""encouraged"" and describes the group as ""advanced,"" which typically indicate approval or praise.

step 2: true intention
however, when we look deeper, sheldon's true intention becomes clear:
1. he's comparing the group's willingness to sail in the ocean to a belief that the earth is flat (falling off the edge).
2. this implies he thinks their beliefs or actions are extremely primitive or foolish.
3. the contrast between calling them ""advanced"" and implying they have such a backward belief creates irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention is to mock or belittle the group's intelligence or beliefs. sheldon is using verbal irony to say the opposite of what he means. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where praise is used to actually convey criticism or ridicule.

 PERSON: I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.
",BBT,0,"to analyze this input carefully, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or helpful. leonard offers to make a list, which seems like a kind gesture. the phrase ""mighty white of you"" traditionally expresses gratitude or appreciation for someone's kindness.

step 2: true intention
however, the phrase ""mighty white of you"" is outdated and has racial connotations that make it inappropriate in modern usage. in this context, it's likely being used ironically or sarcastically. leonard seems to be mocking the idea of making a list of things not to say, implying that the task is unnecessary or patronizing.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of helpfulness contrasts sharply with the likely intention of mockery or criticism. the use of the dated and problematic phrase ""mighty white of you"" in a seemingly polite offer is a strong indicator of sarcasm. leonard is not sincerely offering to be helpful, but rather pointing out the absurdity of needing such a list.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

 AMY: Are you getting sick?
",BBT,1,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. sheldon is claiming to be ""allergic"" to certain people, which is a negative expression. the phrase ""for no good reason"" also carries a negative connotation, suggesting disapproval.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is indeed negative, but it's expressed in a exaggerated and indirect way. sheldon is not literally allergic to people; he's using hyperbole to express his strong disapproval or disdain for those he believes have received undeserved nobel prizes.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention (both are negative), the way it's expressed is what makes this sarcastic. the use of ""allergic"" in this context is clearly not meant to be taken literally. it's an exaggerated way of expressing strong dislike or intolerance, which is a common sarcastic technique.

the phrase ""for no good reason"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, implying that sheldon believes these nobel prizes were awarded unjustifiably, which adds to the overall sarcastic criticism.

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. sheldon is describing a facial expression (""slightly widened eyes of mildly startled"") without overtly negative language. the phrase ""nothing quite like"" typically suggests something is uniquely good or enjoyable.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" this statement is likely meant to be dry and sarcastic. he's probably commenting on someone's underwhelming or minimal reaction to something, using exaggeration to highlight how unimpressed he is. the very specific and somewhat clinical description (""slightly widened eyes of mildly startled"") contrasts with the grandiose opening (""nothing quite like""), creating a humorous mismatch.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral to positive, the true intention appears to be sarcastic. sheldon is using verbal irony - saying something positive to convey a negative or dismissive sentiment. the contrast between the grand opening and the minimal reaction he's describing is a classic sarcastic technique.

",BBT,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll think through this step-by-step to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise and self-deprecation. sheldon is expressing shock (""oh, how could i be so stu..."") at realizing something was a ruse. the incomplete word ""stu..."" is likely meant to be ""stupid.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is likely sarcasm. sheldon, a character known for his intelligence and often condescending attitude, is probably not genuinely calling himself stupid. the exaggerated reaction (""oh, how could i be so stu..."") is likely meant to be ironic, implying that he actually finds it ridiculous that anyone thought they could fool him.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between sheldon's typical character (highly intelligent, rarely admitting fault) and the apparent self-deprecation in this statement strongly suggests sarcasm. the exaggerated language and the fact that it's framed as a question (""how could i be so stu..."") rather than a straightforward admission of error further support this interpretation.

given these factors, i confidently classify this statement as sarcastic. sheldon is likely mocking the idea that he could be fooled so easily, rather than genuinely admitting to being tricked.",1
"BERNADETTE: Well, if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.","PENNY: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?
",BBT,1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or critical. the phrase ""if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone"" is not typically a compliment. the word ""great"" at the end could be interpreted positively, but in this context, it feels more dismissive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be to criticize or mock someone's appearance or choice of clothing. comparing someone to an ""orange traffic cone"" is clearly not meant as a compliment. the ""well, if you don't mind..."" structure is often used to express disapproval or criticism indirectly. the ""great"" at the end is likely not sincere, but rather a sarcastic way of ending the statement.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment (step 1) aligns with the true intention (step 2), but the sarcasm comes from the way it's expressed. the speaker is using exaggeration (comparing to a traffic cone) and false enthusiasm (""great"") to convey their disapproval. this is a classic sarcastic structure where the literal words don't match the intended meaning.

the statement is clearly sarcastic. bernadette is using exaggeration and mock approval to express her disapproval of someone's appearance or clothing choice.",1
"LEONARD: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.","LEONARD: Okay. So... we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people,
",BBT,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""pretty magical night"" suggests a positive sentiment on the surface. ""magical"" is typically associated with wonderful, enchanting experiences.

step 2: true intention
however, the context provided before this phrase contradicts the positive sentiment:
- ""said horrible things about each other in public""
this describes a negative and unpleasant situation, which is at odds with the idea of a ""magical night"".

step 3: compare and analyze
the juxtaposition of the negative description (saying horrible things) with the positive evaluation (magical night) creates a clear contradiction. this contradiction is a hallmark of sarcasm, where someone says the opposite of what they actually mean for emphasis or humor.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

 LEONARD: Yeah, that's not it.
 LEONARD: Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.
",BBT,1,"given the context provided, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. sheldon uses phrases like ""oh, of course he is"" and ""she's very interesting,"" which on their own would indicate a positive, agreeing tone.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the full context:
1. the ""interesting"" fact sheldon provides is about someone severing their own toe webbing at 14, which is unusual and potentially disturbing rather than conventionally interesting.
2. sheldon's character (if this is from the big bang theory) is known for his lack of social awareness and tendency to find unusual facts fascinating.
3. the ""oh, of course he is"" at the beginning could be read as dismissive or sarcastic, especially if sheldon doesn't actually believe the person is interesting in a conventional sense.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems positive, the true intention appears to be sheldon inadvertently revealing that his idea of ""interesting"" is quite different from most people's. he's not intentionally being sarcastic, but rather demonstrating his unique perspective and lack of conventional social understanding.

### label: not sarcastic

while the statement could be interpreted as sarcastic in a different context, knowing sheldon's character and his genuine fascination with unusual facts, this is likely a sincere statement from his perspective, even if it might come across as odd or inappropriate to others.",0

 PENNY: All right, well, what do you think he wants?
 LEONARD: I don't know.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

let me explain my reasoning:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly positive. sheldon is mentioning holidays, which are generally associated with positive feelings. however, the second part of the statement about testicles introduces an unexpected and crude element.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention of this statement is to make a mocking or humorous comment about someone's behavior or situation. the juxtaposition of holidays (a pleasant topic) with a crude anatomical reference creates a jarring contrast that's typical of sarcastic humor. sheldon is likely not seriously suggesting this as a reason; he's using exaggeration for comedic effect.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the disconnect between the seemingly innocent opening about holidays and the crude, absurd suggestion that follows is a clear indicator of sarcasm. sheldon is using this exaggerated and inappropriate comment to mock or criticize someone's behavior indirectly.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic. the use of absurd exaggeration and the contrast between the holiday reference and the crude anatomical joke are classic hallmarks of sarcastic humor, especially coming from a character like sheldon, who is known for his dry and often sarcastic comments.",1
PENNY: Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.,"SHELDON: Oh, oh, oh.

 PENNY: All right, well, what do you think he wants?
 LEONARD: I don't know.
 SHELDON: You know, the holidays are just around the corner.
 SHELDON: Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.
 LEONARD: I told you. That was a different guy.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears slightly negative or disappointed. the phrase ""that's too bad"" typically expresses disappointment. the rest of the statement describes a new year's eve activity in a neutral tone.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are clues that suggest this might not be a sincere expression of disappointment:
1. ""waiting for the ball to drop"" is a common new year's eve activity, but describing it as something they ""could have spent"" time doing implies it might not be very exciting.
2. the phrasing ""we could have spent"" suggests a missed opportunity, but in a way that doesn't sound genuinely regretful.
3. the specificity of mentioning just ""waiting for the ball to drop"" rather than a more general ""celebrating new year's eve"" hints at a focus on a potentially boring aspect of the celebration.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment expresses mild disappointment, the true intention seems to be conveying that waiting for the ball to drop on new year's eve is not actually an exciting prospect. the speaker is likely using verbal irony to suggest that missing this opportunity is not really ""too bad"" at all, but rather a relief or non-issue.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

 SHELDON: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. leonard is agreeing (""sure"") and suggesting an activity (seeing what scientists are wearing). there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
considering this is likely from a sitcom context (given the character name ""leonard""), and knowing that scientists aren't typically known for their fashion, the true intention is probably to mock the idea of scientists being fashionable or interesting to observe for their clothing choices. the suggestion to ""see what all the scientists are wearing"" is likely meant to be humorous because it's implying scientists' attire would be noteworthy or exciting when it's typically perceived as mundane or unfashionable.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly positive, the underlying intention appears to be making a joke at the expense of scientists' perceived lack of fashion sense or the absurdity of being interested in scientists' clothing. this discrepancy between the surface meaning and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

And now we're reversed.
 PERSON: You're the winner.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears slightly negative. the phrase ""you'd think"" often introduces a criticism, and ""decent cup of cocoa"" implies that the cocoa isn't good. the word ""winner"" is typically positive, but it's used in contrast with the implied poor quality of the cocoa.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to criticize or mock someone who is supposed to be a ""winner"" but can't perform a simple task like making good cocoa. the speaker (sheldon) is using verbal irony to express disappointment or disdain. the contrast between being a ""winner"" and failing at a simple task is deliberate and meant to emphasize the criticism.

step 3: analysis and inference
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see a clear discrepancy. the statement isn't meant to be taken literally. instead, it uses irony to convey criticism in a more biting way. this is a classic structure for sarcasm, where praise (""winner"") is used to emphasize criticism (inability to make good cocoa).

 PENNY: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. sheldon acknowledges the news as ""important,"" which is positive. however, he then dismisses biology as being about ""yucky, squishy things,"" which has a negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
sheldon's true intention seems to be to downplay the importance of biology despite acknowledging that the news sounded important. his characterization of biology as ""yucky, squishy things"" is intentionally childish and reductive, which doesn't align with his typically scientific mindset.

step 3: compare and analyze
while sheldon initially seems to validate the importance of the news, his subsequent dismissal of the entire field of biology as ""yucky"" and ""squishy"" contradicts this. this contradiction, combined with the intentionally simplistic and negative description of biology (which, coming from sheldon, is likely not his true scientific opinion), suggests a sarcastic tone.

the juxtaposition of acknowledging importance and then immediately trivializing the subject matter is a common sarcastic technique. sheldon is using sarcasm to express his lack of interest or respect for biology, despite its objective importance.

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no obviously positive or negative words, no emojis, and no clear sentimental phrases. the statement is presented as a simple suggestion or possibility.

step 2: true intention
given that this is a line from sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory""), we need to consider the context and character. sheldon is known for his literal interpretations and lack of social awareness. the suggestion of a ""man with a pocket watch"" seems oddly specific and outdated, which is typical of sheldon's character. it's likely meant to be humorous by highlighting sheldon's misunderstanding of modern dating preferences or social norms.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention is likely to be humorous through its absurdity. however, this doesn't necessarily make it sarcastic. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with a mocking or critical tone. in this case, sheldon probably genuinely believes a pocket watch could be appealing, which is funny because of how out of touch it is, but not sarcastic.

 LEONARD: Me, too; I missed you.
 PENNY: You see me all the time.
 PENNY: You sure you just don't miss the sex?
",BBT,0,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first, with leonard saying ""sex with you is pretty great."" this seems like a compliment or positive statement about their sexual experiences together.

step 2: true intention
however, the follow-up question ""have you ever tried it?"" completely changes the meaning. this implies that the person leonard is talking to has not actually had sex with leonard, which contradicts the first statement. this creates a logical inconsistency that's typically used for humorous or sarcastic effect.

step 3: compare and analyze
the contradiction between the initial positive statement and the follow-up question that negates it is a classic structure for sarcasm. the true intention appears to be making a joke or delivering a sarcastic comment, rather than genuinely praising their sexual experiences.

given this analysis, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

",BBT,0,"i'll think this through step-by-step as the input is unusual and requires careful consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. the speaker is matter-of-factly describing an event that occurred. there are no obvious sentimental keywords or phrases, and no emojis. the tone seems casual and informative.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be humorous or absurd. the speaker is using intentionally misspelled words (""wady"" for ""lady"", ""high-wes"" for ""high-res"", ""wast"" for ""last"", ""cwaigswist"" for ""craigslist"") that mimic a childish or exaggerated speech impediment. this, combined with the inappropriate nature of the described action (taking pictures of one's ""junk"" for a public classifieds website), suggests the speaker is not being serious.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the neutral surface sentiment contrasts sharply with the absurd and humorous true intention. the intentional misspellings and the inappropriate scenario described indicate that the speaker is not sincerely relating a true event, but rather making a joke or being facetious.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence that this statement is sarcastic.

 LEONARD: This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
 PENNY: Okay, you're kind of really great.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest"" suggests an uncomfortable, possibly painful experience. this is not typically how one would describe a pleasant massage.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to criticize or mock someone's massage technique. by using such an exaggerated and unusual comparison (likening a neck massage to being carried off by an eagle), leonard is employing hyperbole to emphasize how bad the massages are. this is a common technique in sarcasm, where one uses extreme or absurd comparisons to make a point.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (negative) aligns with the true intention (criticism), but the way it's expressed is exaggerated and humorous. the use of such an outlandish comparison to describe a massage is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is not literally suggesting that the massage feels like an eagle attack, but rather using this hyperbole to humorously emphasize how unpleasant or aggressive the massages are.

### label: sarcastic

 RAJ: Okay, um... how about ""Crash""? 
Howard ""Crash"" Wolowitz.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive, with words like ""terrific"" and the statement that ""astronauts would love"" something.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly negative and mocking. howard is using irony to point out how ridiculous and dangerous it would be to have an astronaut nicknamed ""crash."" the juxtaposition of ""love to go hurtling through space"" with a person named ""crash"" creates a clear sarcastic tone.

step 3: the stark contrast between the superficially positive language and the obviously negative implication confirms this is a sarcastic statement. howard is using sarcasm to emphasize how bad of an idea it would be to have someone nicknamed ""crash"" as an astronaut.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic.""",1

 AMY: Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.
",BBT,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be serious and explanatory. sheldon is offering a reason for why he might not be performing well, comparing himself to einstein.

step 2: upon closer examination, this statement is likely not meant to be taken at face value. there are a few key points to consider:
1. einstein did not actually fail math - this is a common myth.
2. comparing oneself to einstein is often seen as arrogant or pretentious.
3. sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory"" is known for his intelligence and arrogance.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that this statement is indeed sarcastic. while on the surface it appears to be a straightforward explanation, it's actually a self-aggrandizing comparison that relies on a false premise. the sarcasm lies in sheldon indirectly boasting about his intelligence by comparing himself to einstein, while also making an incorrect statement about einstein's academic history.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and encouraging. key phrases like ""hope your hands are steady"" and ""i'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you"" seem supportive and confident in the addressee's abilities.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be the opposite of the surface sentiment. the speaker emphasizes the extreme difficulty of the task (""width of a single hair"") and then dismissively says ""but this is just biology,"" implying it should be easy. the use of ""genius like you"" in this context comes across as exaggerated and insincere.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. sheldon is apologizing and attributing his attitude to his hair, which on the surface doesn't immediately signal sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
knowing sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" this statement is likely meant to be humorous. sheldon is typically not associated with a ""bad boy attitude"" or trendy hairstyles. he's probably making a joke about himself, implying that his hair (which is usually very conservative) has suddenly given him a rebellious persona.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between sheldon's typical personality and the idea of him having a ""bad boy attitude"" because of his hair creates a humorous contradiction. this is a classic setup for sarcasm, where the speaker says something that is clearly not true or not in character for comedic effect.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the statement doesn't contain overtly positive or negative words, but the suggestion of living inside one's mother's body could be seen as strange or unsettling.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be humorous and absurd. the suggestion of living inside one's mother's body is not meant to be taken literally. it's likely an exaggeration used to make a point about extreme dependency or closeness to one's mother.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see a clear disconnect. the statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the absurdity of the suggestion, combined with the context (assuming this is from a sitcom or comedy show given the character name ""leonard""), indicates that this is meant to be humorous through exaggeration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first, with phrases like ""good times"" and sharing secrets, which typically indicate fond memories and closeness. however, the content of the secrets shared is quite shocking and inappropriate, especially the cousin revelation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the absurdity and inappropriateness of the situation. the speaker is recounting this memory in a way that contrasts the initial positive framing (""good times"") with the awkward and disturbing nature of the secrets shared. this contrast creates a comedic effect through irony.

step 3: analysis and inference
comparing the initially positive framing with the actually disturbing content reveals a clear sarcastic tone. the speaker is not genuinely recounting this as a ""good time"" but rather using sarcasm to emphasize how uncomfortable or inappropriate the situation was. the casual delivery of shocking information (especially about the cousin) further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. howard mentions ""fun night"" and lists activities that generally sound enjoyable: making gift bags, drinking wine, and browsing online. these are typically associated with a pleasant evening.

step 2: true intention
while the activities described could be genuinely enjoyable, there's a subtle shift in tone with ""and then went online and saw this."" the vagueness of ""this"" and its placement at the end of the sentence suggests it might be something unexpected or potentially negative that contrasts with the earlier positive activities.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly fun activities and the ambiguous ""saw this"" online creates a subtle tension. however, there's not enough context to definitively say this is sarcastic. the speaker could genuinely have had a nice evening that ended with seeing something surprising online.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or despondent. key phrases like ""not really up for chatting,"" ""sit here quietly,"" and ""let my life flash before my eyes"" indicate a somber, withdrawn mood.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to align with the surface sentiment. howard appears to be genuinely upset or depressed. the phrase ""let my life flash before my eyes"" is often used hyperbolically to indicate extreme distress or a sense of impending doom, but in this context, it seems to be used to emphasize howard's genuine negative emotional state.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. howard's statement appears to be a sincere expression of his current emotional state and desire to be left alone. the dramatic language (""let my life flash before my eyes"") intensifies the sentiment but doesn't contradict it.

",BBT,1,"to properly analyze this statement for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be disappointment or regret. the use of ""darn"" at the beginning expresses frustration, and the statement suggests that sheldon would have liked to invite the person to join them if they weren't busy.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing sheldon's character (assuming this is sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory""), his true intention is likely the opposite. sheldon often struggles with social interactions and typically prefers not to include additional people in his plans. the statement sounds more like a polite social convention that sheldon might be awkwardly attempting to use, rather than a genuine expression of disappointment.

step 3: comparison and final inference
comparing the surface sentiment of disappointment with the likely true intention of relief or indifference, there's a clear mismatch. this mismatch, combined with sheldon's character traits, strongly suggests that this statement is sarcastic. sheldon is likely using this statement as a way to appear polite or normal in a social situation, while actually being relieved that he doesn't have to include someone else in his plans.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of excitement or amazement. sheldon is talking about communicating with ""a man in space,"" which typically would be considered an impressive feat.

step 2: true intention
however, sheldon's true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disappointment. the comparison to ""the coffee bean over on lake street"" suggests that the communication is so poor that the astronaut might as well be at a nearby coffee shop instead of in space. the mention of ""(walkie-talkie static)"" implies technical difficulties in the communication.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the initial impressive idea of talking to someone in space and the mundane comparison to a local coffee shop creates a sarcastic tone. sheldon is using this comparison to highlight his disappointment with the quality of the communication, implying that the impressive nature of talking to someone in space is negated by the poor connection.

",BBT,1,"to properly assess this statement for sarcasm, i'll need to think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. ""i'm starting to get a sense of it"" suggests a growing understanding or comprehension, which is generally seen as a positive development.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning behind this statement. in isolation, this could be a genuine expression of beginning to understand something. however, depending on the tone and context, it could potentially be an understatement if leonard actually fully understands the situation, or it could be said with exasperation if he's struggling to understand something that should be simple.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information and lack of context, there isn't enough evidence to confidently label this statement as sarcastic. the surface meaning and the likely true intention appear to align. without clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction, it's safer to assume the statement is meant literally.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's always a possibility of sarcasm with more context, based solely on this isolated statement, it appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment about gradually understanding something.",0
"AMY: Well, if that's all it takes, it's a good thing you don't have a dog.","AMY: You slept with him?
 PENNY: I didn't know what else to do.
He had those big, sad eyes.
 BERNADETTE: Oh, sure, you had no choice.
 PENNY: He looked at me like this.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""it's a good thing"" typically indicates a positive outlook. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the statement appears to be a subtle jab or criticism. the implication is that the person being addressed is easily satisfied or impressed by something trivial. the mention of ""if that's all it takes"" suggests that the speaker finds the other person's standards or requirements to be surprisingly low. the dog reference further emphasizes this by implying that even having a dog would be too much responsibility for this person.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment uses positive language (""it's a good thing""), the underlying meaning is actually critical and mocking. this mismatch between the literal words and the intended meaning is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to convey disapproval or criticism in a seemingly positive statement.

### label: sarcastic

the statement exhibits clear sarcastic traits by using seemingly positive language to convey criticism or mockery, creating a deliberate contrast between the surface meaning and the true intention.",1
"PENNY: Of course, it is... it's been in the news. And it's a very famous boson.","SHELDON: There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, color and consistency.
 PENNY: Disgusting.
 LEONARD: No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track.
 PENNY: Why do you need all this stuff...?
 LEONARD: No, no, no, no... Sorry!
 SHELDON: I am glad you asked.
 SHELDON: Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
",BBT,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and knowledgeable. penny is affirming that something is ""very famous"" and has ""been in the news."" the phrase ""of course, it is"" suggests confidence in the statement.

step 2: however, considering the context (this appears to be from the tv show ""the big bang theory""), and knowing penny's character as generally less scientifically knowledgeable, this statement seems out of character. the mention of a ""very famous boson"" (likely referring to the higgs boson) is not typical language for penny.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's a discrepancy between penny's usual character and this seemingly knowledgeable statement about physics. this suggests that penny is likely pretending to know about the topic or mimicking someone else's words without understanding them. the overly confident ""of course, it is"" further reinforces this interpretation.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is likely meant to be humorous by showing penny attempting to sound knowledgeable about a complex scientific topic she doesn't actually understand, which is a form of situational irony often used for comedic effect in the show.",1

 SHELDON: And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.
 PENNY: Yeah, that's basically what I said.
 SHELDON: The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking,
 SHELDON: perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.
",BBT,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my thought process for clarity:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be mocking or belittling. the phrase ""making boom-boom in the potty"" is infantile language typically used when talking to very young children about using the toilet. this is contrasted with the prestigious nobel prize, creating a jarring and humorous juxtaposition.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to ridicule or make fun of someone's achievement by comparing it to a basic bodily function that even toddlers can do. the speaker (leonard) is using exaggerated childish language to imply that the recipient's accomplishment is trivial or unimpressive.

step 3: analysis and final label
the stark contrast between the prestigious nobel prize and the infantile description of using the toilet creates a clear sarcastic tone. the speaker is not genuinely praising the achievement but rather mocking it through this absurd comparison. the use of such extreme understatement (comparing a nobel-worthy achievement to toilet training) is a classic sarcastic technique.

therefore, this statement is definitively sarcastic.",1
"SHELDON: The original title was ""A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism"""" I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.","SHELDON: This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.

 SHELDON: Behold.
 LEONARD: ""Magnets: What Do They Stick To?"" If the answer is ""metal,"" it's not exactly groundbreaking.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be straightforward and serious. sheldon is explaining why he changed the title of his work, citing concerns from religious people in town.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually humorous and sarcastic. sheldon is implying that his work is so advanced and complex that uneducated religious people might mistake it for witchcraft. this is an exaggeration meant to highlight both the sophistication of his work and the perceived ignorance of others.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the serious tone and the absurd implication (being accused of witchcraft in modern times for a scientific paper) is the key to the sarcasm. sheldon is not genuinely concerned about being labeled a witch; he's using this hyperbole to mock both the complexity of his work and the supposed simplicity of others.

the sarcasm lies in the incongruity between the advanced nature of maxwell's equations and electromagnetic theory, and the medieval concept of witchcraft. this juxtaposition creates a humorous effect typical of sarcastic statements.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
PENNY: We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.,"SHELDON: in town were starting to say I was a witch.

 PENNY: Hi. I'm Penny.
 PERSON: Alex.
Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
 PENNY: In a way.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward observation or comment without any clear indicators of sarcasm. penny is simply describing a situation as a ""five-year experiment,"" which could be referring to a relationship, a work project, or some other long-term endeavor. there are no obvious contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would suggest sarcastic intent. the language is neutral and matter-of-fact, consistent with a genuine, non-sarcastic remark.",0

And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him.
 PENNY: Well, a lot of people can't.
 PENNY: Uh, hey.
 LEONARD: Where are we going?
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be direct and somewhat sexual. the phrase ""wants to take your pants off"" indicates a strong physical attraction or desire. the mention of the ""limbic system"" adds a scientific or intellectual tone to the statement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. penny is expressing sexual attraction in a somewhat quirky, intellectual way. by referencing the limbic system (which is associated with emotion and behavior), she's using a nerdy or scientific approach to express her desires.

step 3: compare and analyze
there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. penny is being direct about her feelings, albeit in an unconventional way. the statement doesn't seem to be mocking or contradicting itself, which are common traits of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement, while unusual in its phrasing, appears to be a genuine expression of attraction rather than a sarcastic comment.",0

 SHELDON: Welcome aboard, old chum.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward informational update about howard's final descent, likely referring to a space mission or similar event. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this context. the speaker, raj, is simply relaying information from an official source (nasa web site) without any apparent irony or hidden meaning.",0

 RAJ: Oh, uh, come in, come in.
 RAJ: Oh, I, uh, I didn't think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: on the surface, this statement appears to be a straightforward explanation of why two people are unavailable, using relatively neutral language.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we examine the second part of the sentence more closely. the phrase ""my mom's kind of under my dentist"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's a play on words, using ""under"" in two different contexts - ""under the weather"" (meaning ill) and ""under"" in a sexual sense.

step 3: the sarcasm lies in the unexpected and humorous twist in the second half of the sentence. howard is using a euphemism to imply his mother is having a sexual relationship with his dentist, which is presented in a casual, matter-of-fact way that contrasts with the actual shocking nature of the information. this incongruity between the delivery and the content is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic, using wordplay and unexpected juxtaposition for humorous effect.",1
"HOWARD: It's okay, you know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.","HOWARD: Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist.
 RAJ: Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
 HOWARD: Former dentist.
I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
 RAJ: So you're wandering all around by yourself?
That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to.
",BBT,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and humble. howard is saying that ""space cowboys"" don't seek glory and fame, implying they do their work for more noble reasons. he contrasts this with other professions that supposedly do seek fame.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is likely sarcastic. several clues point to this:
1. the term ""space cowboys"" is not a real profession, which adds a humorous tone.
2. the comparison to ""rock stars,"" ""athletes,"" and specifically ""howie mandel"" (a comedian and game show host) is an odd and exaggerated grouping.
3. the statement implies that these other professions are solely motivated by fame, which is an oversimplification.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears humble and selfless, the exaggerated comparisons and the use of the non-existent ""space cowboys"" profession strongly suggest that this statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the speaker is likely using sarcasm to humorously comment on the nature of fame or to mock the idea of selfless professions.

 RAJ: It's like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other's holes.
",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, so i'll explain my reasoning:

the statement ""that sounds a little funny to an american ear"" is a straightforward observation about how something might be perceived by americans. there's no indication of sarcasm here. the speaker is directly expressing that whatever was previously mentioned might sound unusual or amusing to someone from the united states.

the phrase ""a little funny"" is used in its literal sense to mean slightly strange or odd, not in a sarcastic or ironic way. the tone appears to be matter-of-fact and explanatory rather than mocking or contradictory, which are common in sarcastic statements.

without additional context or cues that might suggest a hidden meaning or intention, this statement appears to be a genuine comment about cultural differences in language or perception, not a sarcastic remark.",0
"PERSON: ""To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.""","HOWARD: Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.
 PERSON: Well, Howard, that's very nice of you.
 LEONARD: Yeah, maybe. Open it first.
 HOWARD: It's my official NASA portrait.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""out of this world"" is typically used as a compliment, suggesting something is extraordinary or excellent. the comparison to ""the guy in this picture"" seems to reinforce this positive sentiment.

step 2: true intention
however, upon closer examination, there are clues that suggest this might not be a straightforward compliment:
1. the phrase ""out of this world"" is being used literally in relation to a comic book store, which often deals with science fiction and space-related content.
2. the comparison to ""the guy in this picture"" using past tense (""was"") implies that the person in the picture is no longer present, possibly an astronaut or character who went to space and didn't return.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention appears to be making a play on words with ""out of this world."" the speaker is likely using the phrase both figuratively (as a compliment) and literally (referring to space-related content in comic books). the comparison to a person who was ""out of this world"" adds a darker undertone, possibly implying that the store is as gone or obsolete as a person who left earth.

this clever wordplay and the potential negative implication hidden within a seeming compliment are hallmarks of sarcasm.

 RAJ: Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""you're right,"" ""fantastic,"" and ""please, tell me more"" suggest enthusiasm and interest. the statement ""i haven't heard enough about it"" also seems to convey eagerness for more information.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is quite different:
1. the phrase ""i haven't heard enough about it all week"" implies howard has actually heard about it repeatedly.
2. ""hearing about that never gets old!"" is likely an exaggeration, suggesting the opposite is true.
3. the overall tone seems excessively enthusiastic, which often signals sarcasm.
4. the context of howard's character (if this is from ""the big bang theory"") is that he often uses sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is clearly positive, but the true intention appears to be expressing annoyance or frustration at hearing about the party repeatedly. the exaggerated enthusiasm and the implication that he's heard about it all week strongly suggest that howard is actually tired of hearing about the party and is using sarcasm to express this.

 AMY: You need to ask him to leave.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be straightforward and somewhat complimentary towards wil wheaton. sheldon refers to him as a ""minor celebrity"" and states that ""many people recognize him."" this seems to convey a positive or neutral sentiment on the surface.

step 2: true intention
however, when we look deeper, we can detect some subtle sarcasm:
1. sheldon says ""once you explain who he is,"" implying that wil wheaton isn't actually that well-known.
2. the phrase ""minor celebrity"" can be seen as a backhanded compliment, suggesting wheaton isn't truly famous.
3. ""many people recognize him"" is vague and could be interpreted as damning with faint praise.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral, the underlying meaning seems to be subtly mocking wil wheaton's level of fame. sheldon is using seemingly complimentary language to actually downplay wheaton's celebrity status. this discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is indeed sarcastic, though in a subtle way typical of sheldon's character.

 HOWARD: I know.

 BERNADETTE: That's a lot for a kid to deal with.
",BBT,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of sadness and comfort. keywords like ""sad"" indicate a negative emotion, while ""cheer her up"" suggests a positive action. the mention of ""ben and jerry"" (likely referring to the ice cream brand) implies comfort food.

step 2: the true intention seems to be a humorous or lighthearted comment about comforting someone who is sad. the speaker first positions himself as the ""only person"" who could cheer her up, but then immediately adds ""ben and jerry"" to that list. this juxtaposition of himself with ice cream brands creates a humorous effect.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, while there is a slight contrast between the initial claim of being the ""only person"" and then mentioning ice cream, this doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the statement is more likely meant to be self-deprecating humor or a light joke rather than sarcasm. the speaker isn't saying the opposite of what they mean, which is a key element of sarcasm.

 LEONARD: Well, he's not wrong.
Howard did go to the International Space Station.
",BBT,0,"to analyze this thoroughly, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or frustrated. the phrase ""milk that cow"" is an idiom suggesting someone is taking advantage of a situation for longer than is reasonable. the question ""how much longer"" implies impatience or annoyance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. sheldon seems genuinely irritated that someone (likely referring to a third party) is still bringing up or benefiting from something that happened five weeks ago. the use of the idiom ""milk that cow"" is meant to emphasize how excessive or unreasonable sheldon finds this behavior.

step 3: comparison and analysis
in this case, the surface sentiment and the true intention are consistent. while the language is colorful and uses an idiom, it's not inverting the meaning or using irony in a way that would indicate sarcasm. sheldon appears to be straightforwardly expressing frustration.

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the statement doesn't contain overtly positive or negative words, but the phrase ""crossing my legs"" in relation to seeing crayons suggests discomfort or unease.

step 2: true intention
this statement appears to be a reference to a past event or experience that left a lasting impression on penny. the connection between crayons and crossing legs is unusual and unexpected, which suggests there's more to the story than what's explicitly stated. it likely refers to an embarrassing or uncomfortable incident from penny's past involving crayons.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is fairly neutral, the true intention seems to be sharing a humorous or embarrassing anecdote. the unexpected connection between crayons and a physical reaction (crossing legs) creates a comedic effect. however, this doesn't appear to be sarcastic. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with a mocking or critical tone. this statement, while amusing, doesn't show signs of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

step 2: this sentence is likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory,"" where sheldon cooper often makes blunt, critical comments. the true intention seems to be sheldon expressing his frustration at someone's lack of progress or improvement, possibly in a game or task they're repeating.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, while the statement is critical, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. sheldon is known for his direct and often tactless communication style. he seems to be genuinely expressing his disappointment rather than using irony or saying the opposite of what he means.

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. the phrase ""tastes great"" is generally positive, suggesting a good recommendation from the liquor store employee.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are a few elements that suggest this might not be a straightforward recommendation:
1. the context of putting liquor in coffee is unusual and potentially inappropriate.
2. the source of the recommendation (a liquor store employee) may not be the most reliable for coffee-related advice.
3. the casual way it's presented (""the guy at the liquor store said..."") suggests a lack of careful consideration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the underlying context and implications suggest this is likely a sarcastic statement. the speaker is probably highlighting the absurdity of taking alcohol recommendations for coffee from a liquor store employee. the incongruity between the positive surface sentiment and the questionable nature of the advice points towards sarcasm.

",BBT,1,"step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly playful. the question ""why don't you ask scotty to beam you up?"" references the popular sci-fi series star trek, where ""beam me up"" is a famous catchphrase.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is likely sarcastic. ""beam me up"" is not a real possibility in our world. by suggesting this fictional solution to an unnamed problem, the speaker is likely implying that the situation is hopeless or ridiculous, or that the person they're speaking to is being unrealistic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying meaning relies on the impossibility of the suggested action. the speaker is using a fictional, impossible solution from pop culture to comment on a real-world situation. this mismatch between the surface suggestion and the real-world impossibility is a classic structure of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

let's think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine question about how someone dumped another person. the use of ""what"" and the question mark indicate curiosity or surprise.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention becomes clear:
- the phrase ""did he use a forklift?"" is not meant to be taken literally.
- this is an exaggeration used for comedic effect.
- the implication is that the person being dumped is extremely heavy, so heavy that a forklift would be needed to ""dump"" them.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be a simple question, the true intention is to make a joke at someone's expense by implying they are overweight. the use of exaggeration and the unexpected comparison to a forklift are classic elements of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be serious advice or a warning. the phrase ""trust me"" indicates sincerity, and the statement is presented as factual information.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention is likely not sincere advice. the statement ""that's how they get you"" implies a conspiratorial or paranoid tone, which is often used in humorous or sarcastic contexts. additionally, the idea that someone could be tricked into being jewish is absurd, which is a common element in sarcastic statements.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly sincere surface sentiment and the absurd content of the statement strongly suggests sarcasm. the use of a ridiculous premise (being tricked into being jewish) delivered in a seemingly serious manner is a classic sarcastic technique.

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""really looking forward to it"" and ""no place i would rather be"" indicate enthusiasm and contentment with the current situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is less clear-cut. while the first sentence seems genuinely positive, the second sentence is more intense and could be interpreted as hyperbole. the phrase ""no place i would rather be than here"" is sometimes used sarcastically, especially when someone is in an undesirable situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a potential mismatch between the moderate positivity of the first sentence and the extreme positivity of the second. this could indicate sarcasm. however, without more context (such as tone of voice, body language, or knowledge of the situation), it's difficult to be certain.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic markers, i'm inclined to interpret this as genuine rather than sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification has a lower confidence level due to the potential for sarcasm in the second sentence. context would greatly help in making a more definitive judgment.",0

this statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. leonard is expressing a genuine preference about how he'd like (or rather, not like) to be surprised. the comment about not wanting to cry on a big screen seems to be a sincere concern about public embarrassment rather than a sarcastic remark. the overall tone is straightforward and doesn't contain typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking.",0

 RAJ: You're wasting your time.
Just please, leave me alone.
 HOWARD: Now what?
 LEONARD: I don't know.
",BBT,0,"to analyze this properly, i'll go through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. bernadette is suggesting going to red lobster to talk about something, which on its own is a normal, friendly suggestion. the phrase ""we're all thinking it"" implies a shared understanding or agreement among the group.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer with the last sentence: ""i just had the decency to wait for him to leave."" this implies that they were waiting for someone to leave before discussing something about them, likely something negative or gossipy. this reveals a less-than-kind intention behind the seemingly friendly suggestion to go to red lobster.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly innocent suggestion to go to red lobster and the revelation that they were waiting for someone to leave before talking about them creates a sarcastic tone. bernadette's use of the phrase ""had the decency"" is ironic, as waiting for someone to leave before talking about them behind their back isn't typically considered decent behavior.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement is sarcastic because it presents a facade of friendliness and decency while actually revealing an intent to engage in gossip or criticism behind someone's back.",1

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and confident. the speaker is making a promise (""i promise you"") and expressing certainty (""you'll see""). the tone seems encouraging and persuasive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. raj appears to be genuinely trying to convince someone to go on a date with him. he's using a persuasive tactic by promising that one date will be enough to change the person's mind or impression about him.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would indicate sarcasm. the speaker appears to be sincere in their attempt to secure a date.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to phrases like ""wonderful idea"" and the enthusiastic tone of suggesting alternatives like rubbing pudding on gums and contacting the syfy channel.

step 2: true intention
however, upon closer inspection, it's clear that sheldon is using heavy sarcasm:
- ""oh, sure"" is a common sarcastic opener.
- the suggestion of rubbing pudding on gums instead of flossing is absurd and clearly not meant seriously.
- ""give them what for"" is an idiom often used sarcastically to mock the idea of complaining.
- the overall tone is exaggerated and mocking, indicating that sheldon strongly disagrees with whatever was suggested before this quote.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface positive sentiment is completely at odds with sheldon's true intention, which is to ridicule and dismiss the idea he's responding to. the use of absurd examples and exaggerated enthusiasm are classic hallmarks of sarcasm.

this line is indeed sarcastic. howard is using understatement and irony to acknowledge that his actions (putting up a camera) have gone well beyond just being ""creepy."" the phrase ""looking at creepy in the rearview mirror"" metaphorically suggests they've gone so far past creepy that it's barely visible behind them. this self-aware admission of excessive behavior, delivered in a casual and somewhat humorous tone, is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1

",BBT,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive or neutral. the person is thanking someone for food (burrito and pork rinds) and for sharing information (lecture on monster trucks).

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention seems to be expressing irritation or boredom. the key clues are:
1. ""i think i'm gonna go"" suggests a desire to leave, possibly due to discomfort or boredom.
2. the oddly specific ""20-minute lecture"" implies it was unsolicited and perhaps unwanted.
3. the unusual combination of items (burrito, pork rinds, and monster truck lecture) creates a sense of absurdity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface gratitude contrasts sharply with the implied desire to leave and the subtle criticism of the host's behavior. this mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is using polite language to mask their true feelings of annoyance or boredom.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic. the speaker is not genuinely thankful for the experience but is using sarcasm to express their discomfort or desire to leave the situation.",1

 HOWARD: What?
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""lane frequented by liars"" and ""you big liar!"" indicate accusation and insult. the tone seems confrontational and accusatory.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. there's no apparent mismatch or irony. the speaker (raj) appears to be directly accusing the other person of being a liar, using somewhat playful but still confrontational language.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. the statement is a direct accusation without any apparent irony or reversal of meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the language is somewhat colorful (""lane frequented by liars""), but it's used to reinforce the direct accusation rather than to create a sarcastic tone.

### label: not sarcastic

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with phrases like ""i'm sure she finds it charming."" this seems to suggest approval or admiration for the behavior described.

step 2: true intention
looking closer, we can see that bernadette is actually criticizing someone's driving behavior. the context suggests frustration with someone who won't go around a bus in the right lane. the phrase ""i'm sure she finds it charming"" is using irony to express the opposite of what's literally said.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface positive sentiment in step 1 contrasts sharply with the true critical intention in step 2. this mismatch, along with the use of irony, is a clear indicator of sarcasm. bernadette is not genuinely suggesting that anyone would find this driving behavior charming; she's using sarcasm to express frustration or criticism.

 AMY: It was good.
 SHELDON: That's it?
 SHELDON: ""Good""?
",BBT,1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. amy says ""i enjoyed it"" and mentions ""losing my virginity,"" which typically has positive connotations of excitement or a significant life event.

step 2: true intention
the true intention reveals a humorous misunderstanding. amy expected a sexual experience when told about ""losing her virginity,"" but instead was shown the movie ""raiders of the lost ark"" for the first time. this creates a comedic contrast between the expectation and reality.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention is to highlight the amusing misinterpretation. the contrast between the sexual expectation and the innocent movie-watching experience creates a humorous situation. this use of unexpected juxtaposition and playing with the literal versus figurative meaning of ""losing virginity"" is a classic sarcastic technique.

### label: sarcastic

 SHELDON: Anyway, thank you for watching it.

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to the phrase ""very entertaining"". this suggests enjoyment or a positive viewing experience.

step 2: true intention
however, the sentence ends with ""despite the glaring story problem."" this qualifier contradicts the initial positive sentiment. the use of ""glaring"" emphasizes a significant flaw in the story, which is not typically associated with something truly entertaining. the ellipsis (...) also hints at a pause or hesitation, potentially indicating that the speaker is about to contradict or qualify their initial statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the initial positive statement and the subsequent negative qualifier suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm. they're saying it was entertaining, but then immediately pointing out a major flaw, implying that it wasn't actually entertaining at all. the use of ""very"" before ""entertaining"" could be an overemphasis that further hints at sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the surface sentiment appears positive, the true intention is to criticize the story. this contradiction and the way it's phrased strongly indicate sarcasm.",1

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or disbelief at someone's restraint, likely in a romantic or sexual context. the speaker, penny, is expressing intense attraction or desire towards someone, questioning how another person can resist acting on such feelings. this kind of hyperbolic language is common in romantic conversations or fictional dialogues and doesn't carry the hallmarks of sarcasm. the statement is direct and passionate rather than ironic or mocking, which are typical characteristics of sarcastic speech.",0

Hmm.
 AMY: I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together.
",BBT,0,"to accurately classify this statement, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive and excited. phrases like ""brave new world"" and ""little lady"" suggest an optimistic, adventurous tone. the speaker appears to be looking forward to something.

step 2: true intention
this line is from sheldon cooper in ""the big bang theory."" knowing his character, the phrase ""brave new world"" is likely an exaggeration. the use of ""little lady"" is atypical for sheldon and seems condescending. the context suggests he's about to use the bathroom, making the grand language absurdly mismatched to the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the mismatch between the grandiose language and the mundane situation (presumably using the bathroom) creates a humorous effect. sheldon's character often uses overly formal or dramatic language in everyday situations, which is a form of deadpan humor rather than outright sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

while the statement is humorous due to its exaggeration and mismatched tone, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic in the traditional sense. sheldon isn't saying the opposite of what he means; he's genuinely relieved to use the bathroom but expressing it in an absurdly dramatic way. this is more accurately classified as deadpan or situational humor rather than sarcasm.",0

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to break it down step-by-step. the statement from sheldon appears to be a straightforward declaration of his intentions without any apparent sarcastic undertones.

sheldon is making a distinction between ""bothering"" someone and ""talking"" to them, which is characteristic of his literal and precise communication style often depicted in ""the big bang theory"" series. there's no evident contrast between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems to be a genuine expression of sheldon's perspective on his planned interaction.",0

 SHELDON: No. Wait, I want to guess. Don't tell me.
 PERSON: I wasn't going to tell you.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive and confident. sheldon says ""i'm really good at this"" and seems eager to guess or solve something, asking for a hint. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
analyzing the context and language style, this seems to be a genuine attempt by sheldon to guess something. the mention of ""difficulty initiating a stream of anything"" suggests he's trying to diagnose a medical condition or solve a problem. this aligns with sheldon's character (if this is from the big bang theory), who often believes he's highly competent in various fields.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (confidence and eagerness to solve) matches the true intention (actually trying to guess or diagnose something). there's no apparent mismatch between what's said and what's meant. the question about ""difficulty initiating a stream"" is direct and doesn't seem to have a hidden meaning or irony.

given this analysis, i can confidently say this statement is not sarcastic. sheldon appears to be genuinely trying to solve a problem or make a guess, which is consistent with his character.

",BBT,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. leonard claims he was his mother's favorite child, which typically would be a positive statement.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we consider the context:
- leonard mentions getting ""an ugly, itchy sweater"" while his brother got a car.
- he phrases the statement as a rhetorical question: ""why? because i got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car?""
- he then contradicts this obvious disparity by stating ""no, i was her favorite.""

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that leonard is being sarcastic. the surface claim of being the favorite child directly contradicts the evidence he provides (getting a poor gift compared to his brother's). the rhetorical question and the contradictory ""no"" further emphasize the sarcastic tone.

this statement from sheldon doesn't appear to contain any sarcastic elements. it seems to be a straightforward attempt to change the subject of conversation, followed by a somewhat random fact about himself. this is typical behavior for sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory,"" who often makes abrupt topic changes and shares unexpected personal information. the question about yodeling is likely meant to be quirky or humorous, but not sarcastic.",0

 PENNY: And in a different way than it was 20 minutes ago.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my thought process:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to phrases like ""i can't believe"" and ""wasted all that time,"" which express disappointment or frustration.

step 2: true intention
given that this is a quote from sheldon (likely from the big bang theory), we need to consider his character and the context. sheldon is known for his enthusiasm for comics and cosplay. the true intention is likely expressing genuine disappointment about not being able to use the hulk costumes they worked hard on.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
while the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention (both are negative), the exaggerated language ""wasted all that time"" for something sheldon would typically value highly suggests sarcasm. the sarcasm lies in the irony of sheldon considering costume preparation as wasted time, which is contrary to his usual character.

therefore, i classify this statement as sarcastic.",1

",BBT,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive and encouraging. sheldon seems to be giving permission or advice to someone about how to end a meeting.

step 2: however, the true intention is actually mocking or criticizing. sheldon is implying that the person's idea or contribution is so bad that it's a joke, and he's sarcastically suggesting they use it to end the meeting (when jokes are typically used to start meetings).

step 3: the disconnect between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the actually negative true intention is a clear indicator of sarcasm. sheldon is using verbal irony to convey his disapproval or criticism in a biting, humorous way.

therefore, the statement is definitely sarcastic.",1

 PENNY: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
",BBT,0,"to properly classify this statement, i'll need to think through it step-by-step, as the sarcasm level isn't immediately clear from the text alone.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the question ""what do you think i was gonna do at home?"" doesn't contain overtly positive or negative words. however, the phrasing suggests a hint of defensiveness or frustration.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this question seems to be challenging an unspoken assumption or accusation. the speaker appears to be responding to an implied criticism or suspicion about their activities at home. the phrasing suggests they feel the need to defend or explain themselves, possibly against an unreasonable expectation.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the underlying intention carries a tone of frustration or exasperation. this discrepancy between the literal words and the implied meaning suggests a degree of sarcasm. the speaker is likely using this rhetorical question to highlight the absurdity of whatever assumption they're responding to.

given this analysis, i would classify this statement as:

step 1: surface sentiment
the first part of the sentence seems neutral or even positive, suggesting buying a cake or pie. however, the second part contains the phrase ""insult to her faith,"" which is typically negative.

step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""cake or pie"" (typically positive gifts) with ""insult to her faith"" (clearly negative) creates a stark contrast. the use of ""always thoughtful"" to describe an insult is clearly contradictory, as insults are not typically considered thoughtful.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment starts neutral but ends negative. however, the true intention is to highlight the absurdity of considering an insult as a thoughtful gesture. this contradiction between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using irony to mock the idea that insulting someone's faith could be considered a thoughtful action.",1

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

penny's statement is clearly sarcastic. the idea of looking for ""clues inside a beer"" is absurd and not meant to be taken literally. this is a humorous way of saying she's going to get a beer from the fridge under the guise of investigating, likely in a situation where she's not supposed to be drinking or is using the ""investigation"" as an excuse to have a beer. the sarcasm comes from the obvious mismatch between the stated intention (looking for clues) and the real intention (drinking beer).",1

 RAJ: Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. penny is listing things that are good: her beer isn't flat, her rack isn't saggy, and she concludes by saying ""the future's great."" the use of ""great"" is explicitly positive.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are a few elements that suggest this might not be entirely sincere:
1. the items penny lists as positives are rather trivial or superficial (beer quality and physical appearance).
2. the phrase ""so far"" implies a limited perspective or potential for change.
3. the casual, almost flippant tone when discussing the ""future"" suggests she might not be taking the concept seriously.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the choice of trivial positives and the casual tone suggest that penny might be making light of or mocking the idea of a great future. the contrast between the mundane positives and the grand concept of ""the future"" creates a humorous dissonance that's characteristic of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is sarcastic. penny is likely using these superficial positives to ironically comment on the future or her current situation.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and accusatory. the phrase ""demented sex pervert"" is strongly negative and insulting. the question format also implies judgment or criticism.

step 2: true intention
considering this is dialogue from sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory""), we need to consider his character. sheldon is known for his literal interpretations, lack of social awareness, and blunt speech. given this context, it's likely that sheldon is not intentionally being sarcastic, but rather asking a literal, albeit socially inappropriate, question based on some prior conversation or situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is harsh and could be interpreted as sarcastic in many contexts, sheldon's character traits suggest that he's likely being literal rather than sarcastic. the shock value comes from his social ineptitude rather than intentional sarcasm.

",BBT,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""let the dead man talk"" seems somewhat morbid or dark on the surface. it's followed by a neutral question ""so, why do you think that?"", which doesn't carry strong sentiment on its own.

step 2: true intention
in context, ""let the dead man talk"" is likely not meant literally. it's probably a figure of speech, possibly used to dramatically introduce someone who hasn't spoken in a while or to sarcastically refer to someone as if they were ""dead"" (inactive) in the conversation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems dark or morbid, the true intention is likely to be a dramatic or humorous way of giving someone the floor to speak. the contrast between the dramatic ""dead man"" phrase and the casual follow-up question creates a humorous effect.

given this analysis, there seems to be a discrepancy between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this statement from sheldon doesn't appear to be sarcastic. it seems to be a straightforward question about his career direction after giving up string theory. the tone and content are consistent with sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory"" - he's genuinely seeking advice on his next area of scientific focus. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm. the question appears to be asked in earnest, reflecting sheldon's typical direct and analytical approach to problem-solving.",0

 LEONARD: That's a rude thing to say. Out loud.
 SHELDON: It's an outrage.

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and helpful. howard is seemingly offering career advice, using phrases like ""exciting opportunities"" which typically have positive connotations.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention appears to be mocking or belittling. the suggestion of ""home care for the old and fat"" is likely not a genuine career recommendation, but rather a way to insult or dismiss the person howard is talking to. the use of ""old and fat"" is particularly telling, as these terms are often used pejoratively.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly helpful surface sentiment and the underlying insulting intention is stark. howard is using a superficially positive tone to deliver what is actually a put-down. this mismatch between the apparent meaning and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

 AMY: See? Maybe you'll love living alone.
 SHELDON: I don't know. Perhaps.
",BBT,1,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first, with amy suggesting living together. however, the abrupt ""oh, sure"" at the end introduces a shift in tone.

step 2: true intention
analyzing the dialogue more closely:
- amy starts by suggesting living together, which seems sincere.
- the interruption and repetition of ""you and..."" suggests hesitation or surprise.
- the final ""oh, sure"" is likely delivered in a tone that contradicts its literal meaning. in spoken dialogue, this phrase is often used sarcastically to express doubt or disagreement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the initial suggestion seems genuine, the abrupt shift in tone with ""oh, sure"" strongly indicates sarcasm. this phrase is commonly used to sarcastically agree with something the speaker actually disagrees with or finds unlikely.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the sarcastic ""oh, sure"" at the end clearly indicates that amy is not genuinely agreeing with or considering the idea of living together, but rather expressing disbelief or rejection of the notion in a sarcastic manner.",1

",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic. sheldon is proposing a series of romantic and life-changing events like getting engaged, buying a house, starting a family, and growing old together. the language used includes traditionally positive relationship milestones.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and delivery suggest that sheldon's true intention is the opposite of what he's saying. the exaggerated nature of his suggestions, the rapid escalation from one life event to another, and the final exclamation ""do you hear yourself, woman?!"" indicate that he's not actually proposing these ideas sincerely. instead, he's using these suggestions to mock or criticize the initial idea (whatever was proposed before his response).

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm. sheldon is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to ridicule an idea, which is a common sarcastic technique. the final rhetorical question further emphasizes his disbelief and criticism of the original suggestion.

### label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is using exaggerated positive suggestions to convey his strong disagreement or disbelief with a previous idea or suggestion.",1

 PENNY: Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.
 LEONARD: That's the part you have a problem with?
 PENNY: Relax.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative, with words like ""fighting"" indicating conflict.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear in the second sentence, which personifies wine (sauvignon blanc) and implies that amy treats it better than a person. this is an absurd comparison meant to highlight amy's perceived inappropriate behavior in a humorous way.

step 3: the contrast between the surface description of a fight and the unexpected comparison to wine treatment creates the sarcastic tone. the speaker is using irony to criticize amy's behavior, suggesting she values wine more than people.

the use of personification and the unexpected comparison are classic markers of sarcasm, making this statement clearly sarcastic.",1

 SHELDON: Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?
 PERSON: Um... okay, I guess.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of frustration or disappointment. amy is comparing her long-term relationship with someone else's quick success in a romantic situation. the phrase ""nothing"" in contrast with ""taking his pants off"" suggests a negative comparison.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be expressing exasperation or disbelief at the unfairness of the situation. amy is likely not actually happy about this scenario, but rather using exaggeration to highlight her frustration. the stark contrast between her experience and the other person's is intentionally emphasized to make a point.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment expresses frustration, the way it's conveyed suggests sarcasm. the exaggerated comparison between a three-year relationship with ""nothing"" happening and someone else's immediate success is likely not meant to be taken literally. it's a rhetorical device used to emphasize amy's frustration in a humorous or biting way.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement.

### label: sarcastic

the exaggerated comparison and the use of hyperbole to express frustration are clear indicators of sarcasm in this context.",1

 HOWARD: That does sound fun.
 RAJ: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be sheldon offering a straightforward business plan. the tone seems helpful and matter-of-fact.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear in step two of the plan. sheldon suggests spreading a rumor that the comic book store gives customers genital warts. this is clearly not a genuine business strategy, but rather an absurd and harmful suggestion.

step 3: the contrast between the seemingly helpful tone of offering a business plan and the ridiculous, destructive nature of the actual plan reveals the sarcastic intent. sheldon is not seriously suggesting this course of action, but rather using extreme exaggeration to make a point or express frustration.

the use of such an outlandish and inappropriate suggestion in the guise of a helpful business plan is a clear indicator of sarcasm. therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1
"SHELDON: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.","RAJ: You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dump Leonard?

 PENNY: Well, good job. Now she hates me.
 RAJ: Great.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""on the bright side"" typically indicates a positive sentiment. however, the rest of the statement talks about losing friends, which is generally negative. the phrase ""i wonder who you're going to lose next"" also carries a negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
despite the initial ""bright side"" phrase, sheldon's statement is actually quite mean-spirited. he's pointing out that someone has lost a friend and speculating about future friend loss, which is not genuinely positive or supportive. the ""bright side"" is that a study was proven correct, but this is at the expense of someone's social relationships.

step 3: analysis and inference
the contrast between the seemingly positive opening (""on the bright side"") and the actually negative content (losing friends) is a classic indicator of sarcasm. sheldon is using a typically positive phrase to introduce what is clearly a negative situation, creating a stark and intentional mismatch between the words and their meaning. this is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""it's true,"" ""you're both gorgeous,"" and ""says something about the man"" seem to be offering compliments and agreement.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems more complex:
- the phrase ""kind of says something about the man who could bed you both"" has a potentially negative or judgmental undertone.
- it implies that the speaker is making a comment about the character or qualities of a man who could attract or be intimate with both women.
- this could be interpreted as a backhanded compliment or a subtle criticism disguised as praise.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the underlying message appears to have a subtle sting or criticism. however, this doesn't quite reach the level of clear sarcasm. the statement is more of a veiled comment or subtle jab rather than an outright reversal of meaning typical in sarcasm.

given this analysis, i would conclude:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""boy, when you met bernadette"" suggests something significant happened, and mentioning ""the field of robotics"" implies a notable impact. the word ""hit"" could be interpreted positively as making a significant impact.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be quite different from the surface sentiment. the phrase ""really took a hit"" is actually an idiom meaning to suffer damage or a setback. the implication is that when the person met bernadette, they stopped focusing on robotics, which negatively impacted the field.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears positive, but the true intention is to point out a negative consequence. this mismatch between the seemingly positive framing and the actual negative implication is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to make a pointed comment about how meeting bernadette led to a loss for the field of robotics.

",BBT,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive. penny uses phrases like ""good thing"" and ""lesson"", which typically have positive connotations. the overall tone seems to suggest they've gained something beneficial from the experience.

step 2: true intention
however, when we look closer, the phrase ""lesson in what not to do"" implies that they've observed negative examples or mistakes. this suggests that the experience itself wasn't actually positive, but rather served as a cautionary tale or example of poor behavior/decisions.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the initially positive-sounding ""maybe it's a good thing"" and the revelation that it's actually a lesson in negative examples creates a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. this mismatch is a hallmark of sarcasm, where someone says something seemingly positive but actually means the opposite.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be matter-of-fact or slightly humorous. there are no overtly positive or negative words, no emojis, and no clear sentimental phrases. the statement seems to be describing a common situation in a casual manner.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is likely to be humorous or mildly shocking. it's implying that getting out of a car without underwear is a common occurrence for ""all of us,"" which is generally not true and would be considered inappropriate or embarrassing for most people. this exaggeration and casual treatment of a potentially scandalous situation suggests the speaker is either joking or making light of a specific incident.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention appears to be humorous through exaggeration and casual treatment of an unusual situation. however, this doesn't necessarily make it sarcastic. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with a mocking or critical tone. in this case, the statement is more of an exaggeration for comedic effect rather than a reversal of meaning.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative or disapproving. the phrase ""no one wants to see"" implies a lack of desire or interest in the described scenario. the vivid and somewhat absurd imagery of neil degrasse tyson in a wet t-shirt bent over a porsche hood also contributes to a potentially off-putting or humorous surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is likely to be humorous and exaggerated. it's using an unexpected and somewhat ridiculous image of a well-known astrophysicist in a sexualized context typically associated with models or celebrities. this juxtaposition of a serious scientific figure with a stereotypical ""sexy"" pose is meant to be funny and absurd.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface disapproval with the likely intention of humor, we can see a clear disconnect. the statement is using exaggeration and unexpected imagery to create a humorous effect. this mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended humorous effect is a hallmark of sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears positive. the use of ""wow"" and the phrase ""went where no man has gone before"" typically indicate admiration or amazement at someone's achievement.

step 2: true intention
the phrase ""went where no man has gone before"" is a famous quote from star trek, typically used to describe groundbreaking achievements. however, in this context, it's likely being used ironically. the name ""howard"" suggests this might be from a sitcom or similar context, where the phrase is probably being applied to a mundane or embarrassing situation rather than a genuine achievement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment contrasts with the likely ironic use of the star trek quote. this mismatch between the apparent praise and the probable mundane reality of the situation strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""pretty cool"" suggests a positive attitude towards the object being discussed, whether it's a tribble or a toupee.

the true intention seems to be genuine and straightforward. there's no obvious contradiction or exaggeration that would typically indicate sarcasm. the speaker is simply describing an object and expressing a positive opinion about it, regardless of what it actually is.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy. the statement is delivered in a matter-of-fact manner, with a touch of uncertainty (""it could be a toupee""), but ultimately concludes with a sincere positive assessment (""pretty cool"").

step 2: true intention

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention reveals a discrepancy. leonard is using indirect language and a seemingly casual tone to deliver criticism or express disapproval. this mismatch between the surface sentiment and the underlying meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or surprised, as indicated by:
- ""wow"" - an exclamation of surprise or admiration
- ""you still have it?"" - expressing amazement that something has been kept

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention seems to be sarcastic or mocking:
- ""i just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere"" - this suggests that bernadette thought the item was carelessly discarded or neglected, implying it wasn't worth keeping or taking care of.
- the contrast between the initial surprise and the following assumption creates a sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positivity of ""wow, you still have it?"" is immediately undercut by the following statement, which reveals bernadette's actual, less flattering assumption. this contrast between the apparent surprise and the revealed expectation of neglect is a classic sarcastic structure.

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. sheldon is saying he's listening to someone snore and wondering how he'll ever sleep without it. this could be interpreted as him finding comfort in the sound.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention is likely the opposite. snoring is generally considered an annoying sound that disrupts sleep. the statement ""wondering how i'll ever sleep without it"" is almost certainly not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the surface sentiment (seemingly positive about the snoring) and the likely true feeling (annoyance at being kept awake) strongly indicates sarcasm. sheldon is using verbal irony to express his frustration with the snoring by pretending it's something he'll miss.

given this analysis, i'm confident in classifying this statement as sarcastic. the use of irony to express the opposite of what is literally said is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1

 AMY: I'm sure he brought it.
 SHELDON: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.
 AMY: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast.
",BBT,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. amy is talking about breakfast and casually mentioning a syrup-free section of her dashboard. there are no overtly sentimental words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting an absurd or inconvenient situation. the mention of syrup on a car dashboard implies a messy eating situation, likely while driving. amy seems to be pointing this out in a deadpan or matter-of-fact way, which can be a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention appears to be highlighting an absurd situation in a deadpan manner. this discrepancy between the casual tone and the implied ridiculous scenario (eating messily in a car) suggests sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is sarcastic, albeit in a subtle way.

 HOWARD: How can I convince you it won't?
 BERNADETTE: Well, is there anything about me you're keeping inside?
 HOWARD: I'm not answering that. 
It's a trap.
 BERNADETTE: So there<i> are</i> things you don't like.
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. howard uses phrases like ""in the trap"" and ""chew my leg off,"" which are typically associated with distress or discomfort. the statement ""you just keep talking"" also implies annoyance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is indeed to express frustration and discomfort, but in an exaggerated, humorous way. howard is using hyperbole (chewing his leg off) to dramatically illustrate how trapped he feels in the conversation. this is a common technique in sarcastic or witty remarks.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention (both are negative), the exaggerated language and imagery used (comparing a tedious conversation to being so trapped that one would chew off their own leg) pushes this statement into the realm of sarcasm. the hyperbole is used for comedic effect, which is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

you're okay with that.
 BERNADETTE: Uh-huh.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the key phrase ""i love that"" suggests enthusiasm and appreciation for the situation described. the statement seems to express contentment with the current arrangement of work and household responsibilities.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. several clues suggest this:
1. the imbalance of responsibilities described (bernadette working and doing all the cleaning)
2. the phrase ""you're okay with that"" implies criticism of the other person's acceptance of this unfair situation
3. the overall tone, when considering the context, seems more accusatory than genuinely appreciative

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the positive surface sentiment (""i love that"") and the likely negative true intention (criticism of an unfair situation) is a classic indicator of sarcasm. bernadette is using verbal irony to highlight and criticize the inequity in their household arrangement.

 SHELDON: Well, I'm done speaking to you.
 AMY: Don't be like that. You two need to talk this out.
 PENNY: Yeah, 'cause you sound really funny.
 LEONARD: Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.
",BBT,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative and alarmist. sheldon is listing various risks and potential complications after what seems to be a medical procedure. the use of phrases like ""hardly out of the woods,"" ""risk of infection,"" ""blood clot,"" and the extreme scenario of ""a barn spider lay eggs in your nose"" all contribute to a very concerning and negative surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
knowing this is sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" we can infer that his true intention is likely to be factual and literal, albeit exaggerated. sheldon is known for his literal interpretations, lack of social awareness, and tendency to overanalyze situations. he's probably genuinely trying to inform about potential risks, but his social awkwardness and tendency towards hyperbole lead him to present this information in an exaggerated and somewhat inappropriate manner.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is quite negative and the scenario about the barn spider seems absurd, this is actually consistent with sheldon's character and how he typically communicates. he's not trying to be funny or ironic; he genuinely believes he's being helpful by pointing out all possible risks, no matter how unlikely.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

sheldon's statement, while exaggerated and potentially humorous to others, is not intended to be sarcastic. it's a genuine, albeit socially inappropriate, attempt to inform about medical risks.",0

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to phrases like ""i love that"" and ""take pride in your looks."" this initially suggests a complimentary tone.

step 2: true intention
however, the context reveals frustration. bernadette is expressing annoyance at having to wait to use the bathroom in the morning because her partner spends an excessive amount of time on their appearance. the phrase ""even when i have to pee in the morning"" indicates inconvenience and discomfort.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""i love that"") contrasts sharply with the underlying frustration. bernadette is using verbal irony to express her true feelings of annoyance. the statement is framed as a compliment but is actually a criticism of her partner's behavior.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly using sarcasm to convey frustration and criticism through ostensible praise.

",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""i love that,"" which typically expresses admiration or appreciation.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be criticism or mockery. the statement ""you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink"" implies that the person being addressed considers themselves above a certain behavior that howard likely sees as acceptable or not a big deal. the use of ""too good"" in this context often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the person is being overly fastidious or pretentious.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the positive surface sentiment (""i love that"") and the critical true intention creates a clear sarcastic tone. howard is not genuinely expressing love or admiration, but rather using sarcasm to point out what he perceives as unnecessary or exaggerated standards of behavior.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a classic sarcastic structure of expressing ""love"" for something that the speaker actually finds ridiculous or worthy of criticism, making it clearly sarcastic.",1

 AMY: And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.
",BBT,0,"to analyze this with high confidence, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""all good things"" suggests something positive, while ""must come to an end"" is a common saying that doesn't inherently carry negative connotations.

step 2: true intention
this line is spoken by sheldon, a character known for his literal and direct communication style in ""the big bang theory"". given sheldon's character, it's likely he's using this phrase in its literal sense, rather than sarcastically. the phrase is often used to express acceptance of a situation ending, even if it's disappointing.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be a mismatch that would indicate sarcasm. sheldon is probably using this common phrase to genuinely express that something good is ending, in line with his typically straightforward communication style.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

this question from howard appears to be a genuine inquiry about professor abbott's family and their potential interest in the belongings being discussed. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this straightforward question. the tone seems neutral and the content is a logical query one might ask when dealing with someone's possessions, especially in a context where the owner (professor abbott) might not be present or able to make decisions about their belongings.",0

 LEONARD: I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat melancholic or resigned. key phrases like ""sad truth,"" ""not everyone will accomplish something great,"" and ""just have to find meaning in the little moments"" suggest a rather somber or pessimistic outlook.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, this quote seems to be a genuine reflection on life's realities. howard is acknowledging that not everyone will achieve grand accomplishments, but there's still value in appreciating life's smaller moments. the language is straightforward and contemplative, without apparent irony or contradiction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention of the statement. there's no discrepancy between what's said and what's meant. the statement is a sincere observation about finding contentment in life, even if one doesn't achieve greatness in conventional terms.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

",BBT,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. penny is saying ""good job, sheldon"" and mentions that what was said was ""almost on topic.""

step 2: however, the true intention seems to be mild criticism or teasing. the phrase ""almost on topic"" suggests that sheldon's contribution wasn't fully relevant. the ""you know what?"" and ""i'm gonna say"" imply a deliberate decision to offer praise, rather than spontaneous appreciation.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see a discrepancy between the surface positivity and the underlying criticism. the praise is exaggerated for something that's only ""almost"" correct, which is a common sarcastic technique. the deliberate nature of the praise further supports this interpretation.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is indeed sarcastic. penny is using exaggerated praise for a less-than-perfect performance, which is a classic form of sarcasm.",1
HOWARD: Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?,"LEONARD: Okay. On the count of three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne.
 LEONARD: Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit.
 LEONARD: Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be self-deprecating or doubtful. howard refers to himself as a ""dummy"" and questions his ability to handle something ""as complicated as a blanket."" the use of ""dummy"" and describing a blanket as ""complicated"" are key indicators here.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. blankets are universally understood to be simple items that require no special skills to use. by exaggeratedly questioning his ability to handle a blanket, howard is actually emphasizing how simple blankets are, contrary to his words.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the surface sentiment (expressing doubt about handling a simple object) and the true intention (highlighting the absurdity of considering a blanket complicated) strongly indicates sarcasm. the exaggeration of calling himself a ""dummy"" and a blanket ""complicated"" are classic sarcastic techniques used to make a point through irony.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using exaggeration and self-deprecation to humorously emphasize how simple blankets are to use.",1

 SHELDON: You know, I don't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
",BBT,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeing or positive, with phrases like ""you're right"" and ""we should do what you do."" this initially seems supportive.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention becomes clear when we consider the full context:
- the suggestion to ""have our mom send us pants from the walmart in houston"" is likely not a serious or practical suggestion.
- the specificity of mentioning walmart in houston adds to the mocking tone.
- this statement is probably in response to someone criticizing penny's clothing choices or shopping habits.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreement (""you're right"") contrasts sharply with the absurd suggestion that follows. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. penny is not actually agreeing or suggesting they should do this; she's using sarcasm to mock the other person's criticism or suggestions.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly sarcastic. penny is using exaggeration and false agreement to ridicule the other person's viewpoint or criticism.",1

 SHELDON: Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty.
 SHELDON: And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster, improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.
",BBT,0,"to properly classify this statement, i'll need to think through it step-by-step, as the context isn't entirely clear and sarcasm often relies heavily on context.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no obviously positive or negative words, no emojis, and no clear sentimental phrases. it's a straightforward question about taking someone to office depot.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. however, the phrasing ""is that why you had to take him"" suggests there might be an underlying implication or accusation. the mention of office depot, a mundane location, at night, could be seen as unusual or suspicious.

step 3: analysis and inference
while there's potential for this to be sarcastic, especially if delivered with a certain tone of voice or in a specific context, there's not enough information to conclusively determine sarcasm. the question could be genuine curiosity about an odd situation, or it could be a sarcastic implication about someone's behavior or an excuse they've given.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the ambiguity without more context, i would err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

Ladies?
 PENNY: Come in.
 SHELDON: Ladies.
 PENNY: What's up?
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""elevated anxiety levels"", ""increase my discomfort"", and ""tasteless uncensored crotch talk"" all suggest discomfort and unpleasantness.

step 2: true intention
this is a quote from sheldon cooper, a character known for his literal and often socially awkward speech patterns. in this context, he's likely being genuine about experimenting with anxiety and discomfort. however, the extreme and somewhat humorous way he describes it (""tasteless uncensored crotch talk"") suggests a level of exaggeration or dry humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention seems to be a mix of genuine experimentation with anxiety and a somewhat humorous description of the situation. the exaggerated language and sheldon's known character traits suggest that while he may genuinely be trying to increase his anxiety, he's describing it in a way that's unintentionally funny to others.

given this analysis, i don't believe this statement is intentionally sarcastic. sheldon is likely being genuine in his intent, even if his description comes across as humorous to others.

",BBT,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears negative due to words like ""difficult,"" ""bloated,"" ""cranky,"" and ""crampy."" these words describe unpleasant physical and emotional states.

step 2: the true intention of this statement is likely not sarcastic. it appears to be a genuine, albeit insensitive, comment about the difficulties of dealing with someone experiencing menstrual symptoms. the character sheldon, from the context, is known for his lack of social tact and tendency to make blunt, factual statements without considering their emotional impact.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. there's no reversal of meaning or ironic twist that would indicate sarcasm. sheldon is likely expressing his genuine opinion, albeit in a socially inappropriate way.

 LEONARD: Me-wow.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive. the speaker mentions creating user accounts to post ""positive comments"" about a paper, which on the surface seems supportive.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention seems questionable and potentially unethical. creating multiple accounts to post positive comments about one's own paper is a form of deception and manipulation. this behavior is generally frowned upon in academic and professional circles as it artificially inflates the perceived value of the work.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of support contrasts sharply with the underlying unethical behavior. this disconnect between the apparently positive action and the deceitful intent is a hallmark of sarcasm. however, in this case, it doesn't seem that raj is being sarcastic. instead, he appears to be genuinely admitting to engaging in this behavior, possibly not realizing or caring about its impropriety.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is:

 RAJ: That's what I said when we moved it.
 BERNADETTE: You helped him?!
",BBT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the statement is straightforward, indicating that stuart independently chose throw pillows. there are no overtly negative or positive keywords or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention likely differs from the surface meaning. several factors suggest this:
1. the specificity of mentioning throw pillows, a minor decorative item, implies it might be significant.
2. the emphasis on stuart doing this ""all on his own"" could be exaggerating his independence or ability.
3. the context of this being said by ""raj"" suggests it might be a response or comment about stuart's taste or decision-making.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the neutral surface sentiment with the likely underlying intention, there's a discrepancy. the statement appears to be praising stuart's independence in choosing decor, but the specificity and emphasis suggest mockery or criticism of his taste or ability to make good choices.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is likely implying that stuart's choice of throw pillows is poor or questionable, while on the surface appearing to compliment his independence.

 BERNADETTE: So, where is it?

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""i don't know"" indicates uncertainty, while ""perhaps"" suggests a mild, non-committal hypothesis. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emotive phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a genuine suggestion or hypothesis about what might have happened. the speaker is offering a plausible explanation for a situation (likely in response to someone wondering where something is). the language is straightforward and doesn't employ any obvious rhetorical devices or unusual stylistic choices that might indicate sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy or contradiction. the statement seems to be a sincere attempt to offer a possible explanation for a situation. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or mockery that would typically signal sarcasm.

 LEONARD: Okay.
 SHELDON: Do you want to say it?
 AMY: Let's say it together.
 SHELDON: We're getting a turtle!
",BBT,1,"to accurately classify this statement, i'll go through the steps to analyze it carefully:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or celebratory. keeping champagne on ice suggests preparing for a celebration or good news. the phrase ""this is why i've been saying"" implies a sense of validation or correctness in one's previous statements.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. the statement could be genuinely celebratory, or it could be an exaggerated response to a minor event, implying sarcasm. the character penny (if this is from a script) might be known for sarcastic comments, but we don't have that information.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited context and the ambiguity of the statement, it's challenging to definitively classify this as sarcastic. while it could be a sarcastic overreaction to something trivial, it could also be a genuine expression of excitement or validation.

due to the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the absence of contextual clues, i'm inclined to classify this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification is made with less than 90% confidence due to the ambiguity and lack of context. in a real-world scenario, more context would greatly improve the accuracy of this classification.",0
"PERSON: Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.","PERSON: Glad you guys could make it.
 LEONARD: Of course.
 PENNY: Wow, it looks really pretty in here.
",BBT,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""really sets a mood"" typically indicates a favorable atmosphere or ambiance. the use of ""yeah"" at the beginning also suggests agreement or affirmation.

step 2: however, the true intention seems to be sarcastic. the mention of ""half a dozen menorahs"" is unusual and likely an exaggeration. menorahs are typically used for religious purposes, not for setting a general mood. the speaker is probably implying that having so many menorahs is excessive or inappropriate for creating ambiance.

step 3: comparing the positive surface sentiment with the likely intended meaning, there's a clear discrepancy. the speaker is using a positive-sounding statement to convey a criticism or joke about an excessive or inappropriate use of menorahs. this mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first with phrases like ""good for you"" and ""lovely little notion"". however, the tone quickly shifts with the mocking comparison to inventing the telephone and the ""you just got burned"" comment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly to mock and belittle leonard's idea. sheldon is using exaggerated praise and an absurd comparison to the invention of the telephone to ridicule leonard's notion, whatever it was. the imaginary phone call to leonard's uncle is a rhetorical device to further emphasize how foolish sheldon thinks leonard's idea is.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the stark contrast between the initial seemingly positive sentiment and the actual mocking intention is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. sheldon's elaborate setup and delivery, including the fictional phone call, are designed to maximize the sarcastic impact. the final ""you just got burned"" comment confirms the sarcastic nature of the entire statement.

therefore, this text is definitively sarcastic.",1
HOWARD: It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.,"PENNY: I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is making a joke about the biblical story of the israelites wandering in the desert for 40 years, humorously suggesting that it took that long to ""walk off"" their meal (likely referring to the passover feast). this is a playful and exaggerated explanation that combines a serious historical/religious reference with a modern, casual concept of walking off a big meal, creating a humorous contrast that signals sarcasm.",1

 AMY: Can I be in charge of pricing?
I've been going to garage sales my whole life.
 AMY: Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?
",BBT,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no obviously positive or negative words, no emotional phrases, and no emojis. it's a straightforward statement assigning tasks to amy.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be assigning roles, but there's an unusual element: ""being 75."" this doesn't make literal sense as a task or role, which suggests it might be a joke or sarcastic comment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is neutral, but the inclusion of ""being 75"" as a task is odd and likely humorous. this mismatch between the straightforward assignment of pricing and the impossible task of ""being 75"" suggests a sarcastic or joking tone.

given this analysis, i'm more confident in making a judgment.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is likely sarcastic due to the absurd task of ""being 75"" assigned alongside a normal task like pricing. this kind of incongruity is a common element in sarcastic humor.",1

 BERNADETTE: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or sad. the phrase ""if i had a friend"" suggests loneliness or a lack of friendship. the use of ""might have"" implies uncertainty or missed opportunity.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be self-deprecating humor or subtle sarcasm. amy is likely not literally saying she has no friends. instead, she's probably making a joke about herself, implying that she lacks social awareness or common knowledge that a friend would typically provide.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears sad, the underlying tone and context suggest this is a humorous or sarcastic remark rather than a genuine statement of friendlessness. the contrast between the surface meaning and the likely intended meaning is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses self-deprecating humor and subtle irony to convey a message, which are common traits of sarcasm. therefore, i conclude that this statement is sarcastic.",1

",BBT,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. sheldon's comment ""then buckle up; you're in for a cranky night"" is a straightforward warning or prediction about an unpleasant experience ahead. the phrase ""buckle up"" is often used metaphorically to mean ""prepare yourself,"" and sheldon is directly stating that a ""cranky night"" is coming. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the statement is blunt and possibly rude, but not sarcastic.",0

",BBT,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly negative. the phrase ""pop it like a zit"" is somewhat crude and potentially unpleasant imagery.

step 2: the true intention of this statement is likely meant to be humorous or shocking rather than a genuine instruction. the comparison of eating something to popping a zit is unexpected and deliberately gross, which suggests it's not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the likely intention, there's a mismatch that suggests sarcasm or humor. the speaker is probably not seriously suggesting to eat something in this manner, but rather using an exaggerated, absurd comparison for comic effect.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses an unexpected and exaggerated comparison that's likely meant to be humorous rather than sincere advice, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.",1
"LEONARD: No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.","PENNY: Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?
 LEONARD: I don't know-- some time tomorrow morning.
 PENNY: Don't you want to know for sure?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be serious, as leonard is talking about feeling a disturbance in the force when someone enters california airspace. this references star wars and implies he has some kind of mystical connection or power.

step 2: the true intention is likely humorous. leonard is almost certainly not claiming to actually have force powers. instead, he's making a joke about being so attuned to this person's presence that he'll know immediately when they arrive, exaggerating this awareness by comparing it to fictional mystical abilities.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see a clear mismatch between the surface-level seriousness of claiming force powers and the true intention of making a humorous exaggeration. this mismatch is a hallmark of sarcasm, where someone says something they don't literally mean for comedic effect.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic, using an over-the-top claim (feeling a disturbance in the force) to humorously express how aware he is of this person's impending arrival.",1
"PERSON: Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don't have to not ask me twice.","PERSON: I don't want to rush you, but I'm closing a little early tonight.
 RAJ: Ooh. Hot date?
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems negative or dismissive. the speaker starts with ""uh, no"" which indicates disagreement or reluctance. the phrase ""you don't have to not ask me twice"" is somewhat confusing but implies the speaker doesn't need to be asked again.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be enthusiasm or eagerness, despite the seemingly negative opening. the speaker is actually expressing that they're very interested in joining for meatloaf, so much so that they don't even need to be asked once, let alone twice. the confusion in phrasing (""you don't have to not ask me twice"") is likely intentional wordplay to emphasize their eagerness.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the opening ""uh, no"" seems negative, the overall message is actually positive - the speaker wants to join for meatloaf. the confused phrasing ""you don't have to not ask me twice"" is a playful way of saying ""you don't even have to ask me once."" this mismatch between the apparent negative opening and the actually positive intention, combined with the wordplay, suggests a sarcastic or humorous tone.

### label: sarcastic

the speaker is using a form of verbal irony, saying ""uh, no"" but actually meaning ""yes, absolutely!"" this reversal of apparent meaning, combined with the playful language, is characteristic of sarcasm.",1

 SHELDON: You still didn't pick a date.
 PENNY: Stay out of it! Shut up!
",BBT,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive at first with the mention of romantic elements like the moon and trees. however, it takes an unexpected turn with the mention of elizabeth mcnulty's death, which introduces a somber tone.

step 2: true intention
the speaker, raj, appears to be listing things they can see or experience, but the inclusion of a deceased person's gravestone (presumably) in this list creates a jarring contrast. this sudden shift from romantic elements to mortality suggests a cynical or darkly humorous perspective.

step 3: analysis and inference
the juxtaposition of romantic scenery with a grave marker, especially noting the age similarity, indicates a sardonic view of the situation. the speaker is likely using this contrast to highlight the absurdity or melancholy of the moment, rather than genuinely appreciating the scenery.

given this analysis, there's a strong indication of sarcasm in the statement. the speaker is using irony to convey a message about the proximity of beauty and mortality, or perhaps commenting on the futility of romantic notions in the face of life's harsh realities.

 HOWARD: Happy birthday to you.
 PERSON1: Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas you can actually get married in.
",BBT,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or excited. the use of ""wow"" indicates surprise or amazement, and the statement is presenting an unusual fact about a denny's restaurant in vegas where people can get married.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be expressing amusement or disbelief at the idea of getting married in a denny's restaurant. denny's is typically known as a casual, low-cost diner chain, not a romantic or traditional wedding venue. the juxtaposition of a wedding (typically seen as a special, formal event) with denny's (a casual dining spot) creates an incongruity that suggests the speaker finds this concept absurd or humorous.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears positive, the underlying intention seems to be pointing out the absurdity of the situation. however, this doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm. the speaker appears to be genuinely sharing an unusual fact, albeit with a tone of amusement or disbelief. the statement doesn't seem to convey a meaning opposite to what is literally said, which is a key characteristic of sarcasm.

 PHOEBE: Oh some guy she met in the movies

",FRIENDS,1,"### label: not sarcastic

this quote from chandler in the tv show ""friends"" is a humorous reference to the song lyrics ""i wanna do a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight"" by kc and the sunshine band. while chandler's delivery is likely playful and witty, as is typical of his character, it doesn't contain sarcasm in the traditional sense.

chandler is making a joke by paraphrasing song lyrics to describe someone else's intentions, but he's not saying the opposite of what he means or using irony to mock or criticize. the humor comes from the unexpected reference and chandler's casual delivery, rather than from sarcasm.

therefore, while the statement is humorous, it's not inherently sarcastic.",0

",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment of this statement appears to be neutral or slightly helpful. chandler is giving what seems like advice about using q-tips, suggesting when to stop using them.

step 2: however, this statement is likely not about q-tips at all. it's probably a metaphorical expression used to tell someone they're overthinking or pushing too far into a subject or situation. the true intention is likely to tell someone to stop what they're doing because they've gone too far.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see a discrepancy between the surface meaning and the likely intended meaning. the use of a mundane object (q-tip) to make a point about a more complex situation is a common technique in sarcasm and humor. the absurdity of needing to explain when to stop using a q-tip adds to the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. there are no overtly emotional words or phrases. chandler is talking about looking for his keys, which on its own is a mundane, everyday activity.

step 2: true intention
this line is from the tv show friends, and knowing chandler's character, this is likely a joke about death. the phrase ""if i go first"" is likely referring to dying first among his friends. by saying he wants to be ""looking for his keys"" when he dies, chandler is making light of death by imagining himself doing something trivial and everyday at that moment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention is to make a dark joke about death by contrasting it with a mundane activity. this juxtaposition of the serious topic of death with the trivial act of looking for keys creates a humorous effect through sarcasm and irony.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic due to:
- the repeated ""yes"" for emphasis
- the exclamation marks indicating excitement

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention seems to be negative or sarcastic because:
- the phrase ""in prison!!"" is unexpected and contrasts sharply with the initial enthusiasm
- prison is generally considered a negative place, not something to be excited about
- the all-caps ""ross"" suggests this might be dialogue from a tv show or similar context where sarcasm is common

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the initial enthusiastic agreement and the unexpected mention of prison strongly suggests sarcasm. the speaker appears to be mockingly agreeing with something, then revealing that the agreement only applies in an undesirable context (prison).

 MONICA: Shut up, the camera adds 10 pounds.
",FRIENDS,1,"to analyze this input thoroughly, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of this statement is neutral. chandler is asking a straightforward question about the number of cameras focused on someone. there are no obvious sentiment-laden words, phrases, or emojis that indicate a clear positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
this line is from the tv show ""friends,"" and context is crucial here. chandler is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. in this case, he's likely not genuinely inquiring about the number of cameras, but rather making a comment about someone being overly self-centered or attention-seeking.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention is to make a pointed, humorous observation. chandler is using a seemingly innocent question to imply that the person he's talking to is behaving as if they're the center of attention, like a celebrity surrounded by cameras.

given this analysis, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

chandler's question is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a witty jab at someone's behavior, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1

",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or defensive. chandler is making a statement that appears to be defending or justifying something by comparing it to buildings, which can be very old.

step 2: true intention
given this is a line from chandler in the tv show friends, it's important to consider his character and typical speech patterns. chandler is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor. the statement ""but younger than some buildings!"" is likely an exaggerated comparison, probably in response to someone pointing out that something (or someone) is old.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment seems positive or defensive, but the true intention is likely to highlight the ridiculousness of the comparison or the situation. by comparing age to buildings, which can be centuries or even millennia old, chandler is likely making a joke about how the initial statement of something being old is relatively insignificant.

given chandler's character and the nature of the statement, this is most likely a sarcastic comment meant to be humorous rather than a genuine defense.

",FRIENDS,0,"to properly classify this statement, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be one of excitement or amusement. the repetition of ""and then"" and ""oh oh oh"" suggests enthusiasm or surprise. the description of the woman alternating between being dressed and naked implies a playful or shocking scenario.

step 2: true intention
this appears to be chandler from the tv show ""friends"" describing a website or computer program, likely with adult content. his tone is likely meant to be humorous rather than truly excited. he's exaggerating the absurdity of the situation for comedic effect.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface level sounds enthusiastic, chandler's character is known for his sarcastic and deadpan humor. in this case, he's not being truly sarcastic, but rather using exaggerated description for comedic effect. the statement is meant to be funny, but it's not attempting to convey the opposite of what is said.

",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and self-deprecating. key phrases like ""oh no don't go,"" ""i have scared you,"" ""i have said too much,"" and ""i am hopeless and awkward and desperate for love"" all convey a sense of insecurity, awkwardness, and desperation.

step 2: true intention
this line is from the tv show ""friends,"" spoken by the character chandler bing. chandler is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor. in this context, he's likely exaggerating his awkwardness and desperation for comedic effect. the over-the-top nature of the statement, particularly ""i am hopeless and awkward and desperate for love,"" suggests that he's not being entirely sincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the exaggerated nature of the statement and the character's known tendency for sarcasm indicate that this is not meant to be taken at face value. chandler is using self-deprecating humor to make light of a potentially awkward situation, which is a form of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the exaggerated self-deprecation and the context of the character's typical behavior strongly suggest that this statement is meant to be sarcastic rather than a genuine expression of desperation.",1
MONICA: Sounds like she has got the whole package!,"MONICA: How was your date with Ginger.
 CHANDLER: Great. It was great. She is , uh, she is great, great looking, great personality, she is greatness
",FRIENDS,1,"to properly analyze this statement, i'll go through the suggested steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""the whole package"" is typically used as a compliment, suggesting someone has many desirable qualities. the exclamation point adds emphasis, seemingly reinforcing the positive tone.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, the name ""monica"" in all caps suggests this might be dialogue from a script or transcript. in such contexts, sarcasm is often used for comedic effect. the overly enthusiastic tone could be masking a contrary opinion.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the potential for this to be a scripted line leaves room for sarcastic intent. however, without more context about the situation or the person being discussed, it's challenging to definitively label this as sarcastic.

given the uncertainty, i cannot confidently classify this statement as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. more context would be needed to make a definitive judgment. if forced to choose, i would lean towards ""sarcastic"" based on the potential for this to be a scripted line using exaggerated enthusiasm, but my confidence in this classification is low.",0

 ROSS: I guess he must have gotten the part in the play.

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to positive. chandler is referencing a popular song lyric by gloria estefan in a casual, conversational manner.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to make a humorous, sarcastic comment. chandler is likely responding to a situation or conversation where someone is inevitably going to be affected by something, and he's drawing a playful parallel to the song lyrics.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment doesn't match the true intention. chandler isn't genuinely suggesting that gloria estefan's song lyrics are coming true in a literal sense. instead, he's using the song reference as a witty, sarcastic way to comment on an inevitable situation.

the sarcasm comes from the unexpected connection between a potentially serious situation and a pop song lyric, delivered in chandler's characteristic dry, humorous style.

given this analysis, i can confidently label this as ""sarcastic"".",1

 CHANDLER: Its possible, you are very lovable.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and supportive. chandler says he'd miss the person if they broke up, and explicitly states he's ""trying to be supportive.""

step 2: true intention
however, looking closer at the context and chandler's character (if this is from the tv show friends), there's likely more going on:
1. the statement ""i'd miss you if i broke up with you"" is odd - typically, one would say this about the other person breaking up with them, not themselves.
2. ""just trying to be supportive"" feels tacked on and insincere, especially given chandler's typical sarcastic nature.
3. the overall structure suggests chandler is actually making light of a breakup situation or mocking the idea of being supportive.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface words are positive, the underlying intention appears to be making a joke or being sarcastic about relationship dynamics. the mismatch between the seemingly supportive words and the likely mocking intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

"CHANDLER: Oh, uh, no thanks. I just had an M&M.","PERSON: Hey, you guys the water is great. You should really go in!
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: on the surface, this appears to be a polite decline of an offer, with chandler stating he doesn't want something because he ""just had an m&m.""

step 2: the true intention becomes clear when we consider the context. an m&m is a very small candy, and it would be highly unusual for someone to decline food or drink because they've eaten a single m&m. this response is deliberately exaggerated to create a humorous effect.

step 3: the contrast between the polite, matter-of-fact delivery and the absurdity of the reason given (being full from a single m&m) creates the sarcastic tone. chandler is likely using this exaggeration to humorously deflect or avoid whatever was being offered.

therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic, using understatement and exaggeration for comedic effect.",1

",FRIENDS,1,"to properly analyze this statement, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. chandler's statement ""there is pretty much nothing i can do about it"" suggests a sense of helplessness or resignation.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, this statement is likely meant to be humorous and sarcastic. chandler, a character from the tv show friends, is known for his sarcastic humor. the exaggerated helplessness in his statement (""pretty much nothing i can do about it"") when someone isn't coming back soon is likely not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely intention, we can see a discrepancy. while on the surface it seems like a straightforward statement of inability to act, the exaggerated nature and chandler's character context suggest this is actually a sarcastic comment, likely meant to humorously emphasize his perceived lack of control or influence over the situation.

 JOEY: That's not whipped
 CHANDLER: That's what I did, wapah.
",FRIENDS,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is negative. the phrase ""you can't do anything"" is a direct statement implying inability or uselessness, which is inherently negative.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or rhetorical device at play. the statement could be:
a) a literal expression of frustration or disappointment
b) an exaggeration used to motivate or challenge someone
c) a playful tease between friends

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the straightforward nature of the statement, it's most likely that this is a literal expression rather than sarcasm. sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant, or using a more complex structure to convey irony. this statement is too direct and simple to confidently classify as sarcastic.

this straightforward statement from chandler doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. it's a common, casual way to say goodbye or indicate that one is leaving. there's no discrepancy between the surface meaning and the likely intended meaning, nor any obvious irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, we can confidently classify this as not sarcastic.",0

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly questioning. ""really?"" on its own doesn't carry strong positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's impossible to definitively determine the true intention. ""really?"" could be:
- a genuine expression of surprise or interest
- a sarcastic response implying disbelief or skepticism
- a prompt for more information

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the ambiguity of ""really?"", we cannot confidently determine if this is sarcastic or not. the word itself is often used in both sarcastic and non-sarcastic ways.

the surface sentiment appears positive and excited. chandler uses phrases like ""that's so funny"" and describes a conversation with monica about adding lights to their balcony. the tone seems enthusiastic about the idea.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention reveals sarcasm. chandler is actually mocking monica's rejection of his idea. by saying ""that's so funny,"" he's not expressing genuine amusement, but rather highlighting the irony of the situation. he's pointing out that his suggestion, which monica dismissed, turned out to be a good idea after all.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the disconnect between the surface enthusiasm and the underlying criticism of monica's decision indicates sarcasm. chandler is using verbal irony to express his frustration or amusement at being proven right. the exaggerated retelling of their conversation further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic."" chandler's statement is a classic example of using sarcasm to point out someone else's mistake or poor judgment in a humorous way.",1
"CHANDLER: Oh my god, you almost gave me a heart attack!","CHANDLER: Okay, I am officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joey?
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this statement from chandler appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or shock, rather than sarcasm. the phrase ""oh my god"" and the mention of ""almost gave me a heart attack"" are common exaggerations used to express a startled reaction. in this context, chandler is likely responding to something unexpected or shocking that someone else did or said, and his response seems to be a straightforward, albeit dramatic, expression of his genuine feelings. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement.",0
CHANDLER: Janice? Janice?,"PERSON: Will you get me a white zinfandel and glass of red for Janice.
",FRIENDS,1,"since this input is very short and lacks context, i'll think through it step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no obvious sentimental keywords, phrases, or emojis. it's simply someone (chandler) calling out a name (janice) twice.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. repeating a name could indicate various emotions or intentions, such as:
- surprise at seeing janice unexpectedly
- frustration or exasperation if janice is someone chandler doesn't want to see
- concern if chandler is looking for janice
- excitement if chandler is happy to see janice

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and insufficient context, we cannot confidently classify this as sarcastic. the repetition of the name alone doesn't provide enough information to infer sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

while i can't be 100% certain due to the limited information, the safest classification based on the given text alone is ""not sarcastic."" there simply isn't enough context or clear sarcastic elements to justify a ""sarcastic"" label.",0
"CHANDLER: I am sorry, it was a one time thing. I was very drunk and it was someone else's subconscious","RACHEL: You and I were, uh
 PHOEBE: doing it on this table
 CHANDLER: You okay there?
 ROSS: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment seems apologetic and explanatory. chandler is saying ""i am sorry"" and offering an explanation for his actions.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention appears to be humorous and absurd. the explanation given is clearly nonsensical and impossible - being drunk in ""someone else's subconscious"" is not a real scenario.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see a clear mismatch between the surface-level apology and the absurd explanation. this is a classic setup for sarcasm, where the speaker says something seemingly sincere but follows it with an clearly ridiculous statement. the impossibility of the situation described creates a humorous effect typical of sarcastic remarks.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly meant to be a joke rather than a genuine apology or explanation, fitting the definition of sarcasm as the use of irony to mock or convey contempt.",1
"CHANDLER: And sometimes I would want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.","ROSS: And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this line appears to be a straightforward instruction or explanation from the character chandler, likely in the context of a tv show or script (possibly from the sitcom ""friends""). there's no evident sarcasm or hidden meaning in this statement. chandler is simply describing a potential scenario or signal in what seems to be a sports-related context, likely baseball. the statement is direct and informative, without any apparent irony or sarcastic undertones.",0
CHANDLER: Crazy bitch!,"JOEY: Well the tough thing is she really wants to have sex with me.
",FRIENDS,1,"given the limited context and the nature of the exclamation, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is clearly negative. the phrase ""crazy bitch!"" is an insult, typically expressing frustration, anger, or disapproval. the use of an exclamation mark emphasizes the strong emotion behind the statement.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. however, this phrase is often used in casual, informal settings, sometimes among friends in a playful manner, or in response to surprising or outrageous behavior. the name ""chandler"" suggests this might be dialogue from a tv show or movie, possibly the character chandler from ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly negative, the true intention is ambiguous without more context. in many cases, especially in comedic settings or among friends, such a phrase could be used sarcastically to express surprise, admiration, or even affection in a humorous way. however, it could also be a genuine expression of frustration.

given the ambiguity and the character ""chandler"" (if it refers to the ""friends"" character known for sarcasm), i'm leaning towards a sarcastic interpretation, but my confidence is not high enough to state this definitively.

### label: sarcastic

(note: this classification is made with low confidence due to the lack of context. in a real-world scenario, more context would be necessary for a more accurate classification.)",1
"CHANDLER: Yes, the doctor's say if they remove it, he will die!","RACHEL: This one's from Joey, feels like a book, think itÕs a book. And itÕs a book!
 PHOEBE: Oh its Dr. Suse.
 JOEY: That book got me through some tough times
 PERSON: There is a little child inside this man.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment of this statement appears to be serious and somewhat alarming. the phrase ""the doctor's say if they remove it, he will die!"" suggests a grave medical situation.

step 2: however, this is a line from chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"". the exaggerated nature of the statement, especially coming from chandler, suggests that it's not meant to be taken literally. it's likely an over-the-top response to something trivial or non-life-threatening.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, we can infer that this statement is indeed sarcastic. chandler is probably exaggerating a minor issue by equating it to a life-or-death situation for comedic effect.

### label: sarcastic",1
CHANDLER: And I just won a million dollars!,"ROSS: I don't want to be single. I just, I just want to be married again.
",FRIENDS,0,"given the context and nature of this statement, i believe a step-by-step analysis would be beneficial to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is extremely positive. winning a million dollars is typically seen as a highly fortunate and exciting event. the exclamation point further emphasizes the apparent enthusiasm.

step 2: true intention
this statement is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. in the context of the show, it's highly improbable that chandler actually won a million dollars. the statement is likely an exaggeration used to make a point or express frustration about something else entirely.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the extremely positive surface sentiment and the likely reality of the situation strongly suggests sarcasm. chandler is probably using hyperbole to express something negative or frustrating in a humorous way, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

CHANDLER: You sure he is going to be able to crack that code?,"CHANDLER: Well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I have got pants that need to be altered.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly doubtful. chandler is asking a question about someone's ability to crack a code. the phrase ""you sure"" suggests a hint of doubt or skepticism.

step 2: true intention
in the context of the friends tv show (assuming this is from friends, given chandler's name), chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. the question itself doesn't contain obvious sarcasm markers, but chandler's character often uses a deadpan delivery for sarcastic comments.

without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a genuine question or if chandler is implying that the person in question is unlikely to crack the code.

step 3: compare and analyze
while there's a hint of doubt in the question, there isn't enough evidence to conclusively label this as sarcastic. the question could be genuinely seeking confirmation about someone's abilities. without more context or information about chandler's tone or the situation, we can't confidently claim this is sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

while chandler is often sarcastic, this particular line doesn't provide enough context or clear sarcasm markers to confidently label it as such. it appears to be a straightforward, albeit slightly doubtful, question.",0
"CHANDLER: These people find out that a spelling game is going over there, there will be nobody left at our party.","MONICA: Could guys please try to keep It down? We are trying to start a tournament.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be concern or worry. chandler seems to be expressing anxiety that their party will be deserted if people find out about a spelling game happening elsewhere.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, this statement is likely intended to be humorous rather than genuinely worried. the idea that a spelling game would be so attractive as to draw everyone away from a party is absurd and exaggerated. this hyperbole is characteristic of chandler's sarcastic humor in the show ""friends.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment expresses concern, the true intention is to make a joke by exaggerating the appeal of a spelling game. this mismatch between the apparent worry and the ridiculous scenario being described is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses exaggeration and absurdity to create humor, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. chandler is not genuinely worried about losing party guests to a spelling game; he's making a sarcastic comment about the (lack of) excitement at their party or the perceived nerdiness of their friends.",1

",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""i have no one"" typically expresses loneliness or isolation, which are negative emotions.

step 2: true intention
this line is from the tv show ""friends,"" spoken by chandler bing, a character known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor. in the context of the show, chandler often uses such statements not to express genuine sadness, but as a humorous way to point out his perceived lack of success in relationships or social situations.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, chandler's character and the typical tone of the show suggest that this line is likely delivered with a self-mocking tone. the exaggeration of having ""no one"" is probably used for comedic effect rather than as a sincere expression of loneliness.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses exaggeration and self-deprecating humor, which are hallmarks of chandler's sarcastic style in ""friends,"" to create a humorous moment rather than express genuine sentiment.",1

 MONICA: very bad.
 PHOEBE: Chandler what are you doing?
 MONICA: Chandler?
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this statement by chandler appears to be a straightforward admission about his smoking habits. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. he's simply stating that he was smoking yesterday and is continuing to smoke today. the tone is matter-of-fact and doesn't contain any irony, exaggeration, or other hallmarks of sarcastic speech. therefore, i can confidently classify this as ""not sarcastic"" without needing to break it down step-by-step.",0

 JOEY: Relax ok? I can get this open, anybody got a coat hangar?
",FRIENDS,1,"to analyze this properly, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly confused. chandler starts with ""oh i do,"" indicating agreement or understanding, but then immediately contradicts himself with ""oh no, wait a minute,"" suggesting confusion or realization of a mistake.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor. the statement about taking something out of his shirt when putting it on doesn't make logical sense, as you typically put things into a shirt pocket, not take them out when dressing. this illogical statement is likely meant to be humorous.

step 3: analysis and inference
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that chandler is not actually confused but is intentionally saying something illogical for comedic effect. this is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic humor, where he uses deadpan delivery to say something absurd.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly meant to be humorous and not taken at face value, fitting the definition of sarcasm in the context of chandler's character and the show ""friends.""",1
"CHANDLER: I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.","RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. chandler is talking about littering (a negative action) but with the intention of potentially being saved by ""that crying indian"" (which could be seen as a positive outcome).

step 2: true intention
this statement is actually a reference to a famous 1971 anti-littering public service announcement featuring a native american actor shedding a tear at the sight of pollution. chandler is not seriously suggesting that littering would bring help. instead, he's making a joke by referencing this well-known ad in an absurd context.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment doesn't match the true intention. chandler is using irony by suggesting an illogical and inappropriate action (littering) as a solution to their problem. he's not seriously advocating for littering but rather making a humorous reference that highlights the absurdity of their situation.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly using irony for humorous effect, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

MONICA: Huh! Whats dufus speled backwards?,"JOEY: Okay done
 MONICA: Whats pleh?
 JOEY: ThatÕs Help spelled backwards so that helicopters can read it from the air.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral or slightly curious. monica is asking a question about how to spell ""dufus"" backwards. there are no overtly sentimental words or phrases, and no emojis.

step 2: the true intention behind this question is likely not genuine curiosity, but rather a setup for a joke or a clever observation. ""dufus"" is a slang term for a foolish or stupid person. spelling it backwards would result in ""sufud,"" which sounds similar to ""stupid.""

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that this is likely a sarcastic statement. the seemingly innocent question about spelling is actually a clever way to call someone stupid without directly saying it. the humor lies in the fact that the answer to the question (sufud) sounds like ""stupid,"" which relates back to the meaning of ""dufus.""

",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the phrase ""oh no"" and the negative statement ""its not gonna make any sense"". this suggests disappointment or concern.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. chandler from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic humor, but this line alone doesn't provide enough evidence of sarcasm. it could be a genuine expression of concern about something not making sense.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the likely true intention seem to align in this case. there's no clear indicator of sarcasm, irony, or any rhetorical device that would suggest the statement means the opposite of what it says.

given this analysis, i believe the most appropriate label is:

### label: not sarcastic

while chandler is often sarcastic, this particular line doesn't show clear signs of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward expression of concern or disappointment about something not making sense.",0

 RACHEL: Well I am really sick of your smoking. So I brought something that is going to help you quit.

this statement by chandler appears to be a straightforward, literal comment without any indicators of sarcasm. he's simply stating that a particular patch (likely referring to a clothing patch or software patch) is not good or suitable. the language is direct and doesn't contain any obvious contradictions, exaggerations, or irony that would suggest sarcastic intent. therefore, it can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0

 PERSON2: And he was my best student.
 PERSON1: Yes she was my best teacher.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. chandler is asking a question about what will keep kids in school, implying that something should be effective in doing so.

step 2: true intention
given this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor, and considering the context (likely responding to something ineffective or ridiculous), the true intention is likely to mock or criticize whatever was previously mentioned as a method to keep kids in school.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface question ""if that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?"" is actually implying that the method being discussed is completely ineffective or absurd. chandler is using rhetorical questioning to emphasize how useless or counterproductive the idea is, rather than genuinely asking what would be more effective.

the contrast between the seemingly straightforward question and the implied criticism is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic.",1
"CHANDLER: Hey, my father's house does that.","PHOEBE: And! And!
 RACHEL: Ah!
",FRIENDS,0,"to properly classify this statement, i'll need to think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. chandler is making a simple statement about his father's house having some feature (though we don't know what ""that"" refers to). there are no obviously sarcastic keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, knowing chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" he often uses dry humor and sarcasm, especially when talking about his father. the vagueness of ""that"" could be intentional, potentially setting up a joke or sarcastic comment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, chandler's tendency towards sarcasm and the ambiguous nature of the statement leave room for potential sarcasm. however, without more context or information about what ""that"" refers to, it's impossible to definitively classify this as sarcastic.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and insufficient context, i would err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative or accusatory. chandler is asking if the person was late because they were ""burying this woman,"" which on the surface implies something sinister or illegal.

step 2: true intention
in reality, this is likely a joke or exaggeration. chandler is probably not seriously accusing someone of burying a woman. instead, he's using hyperbole to comment on how late the person was, suggesting they were so late it was as if they had time to bury someone.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface accusation is clearly not meant to be taken literally. there's a stark contrast between the surface meaning and the true intention, which is to humorously exaggerate how late the person was. this discrepancy between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 CHANDLER: I majored in lightning rounds, alright! We are gonna destroy you!
 MONICA: Wanna bet?
",FRIENDS,1,"to analyze this statement for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be genuine confusion. the phrase ""i am so confused"" directly expresses a state of bewilderment or lack of understanding. there are no obvious positive or negative emotional keywords, just a straightforward statement of confusion.

step 2: true intention
considering this is a line from chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends,"" we need to examine it more closely. however, the statement itself doesn't contain any obvious rhetorical devices or exaggerations that would typically indicate sarcasm. it seems to be a straightforward expression of confusion about a situation or conversation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while chandler is often sarcastic, not everything he says is meant to be taken sarcastically. in this case, the surface sentiment and the likely true intention align. there's no apparent mismatch between what is said and what is meant, which is usually a key indicator of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

CHANDLER: A tshirt that says - I don't belong here.,"MONICA: Hey guys, what should I wear to a Nick's game?
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. the sentence simply describes a t-shirt with a specific text on it: ""i don't belong here."" there are no overtly positive or negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the context and the implied meaning. the phrase ""i don't belong here"" on a t-shirt is paradoxical. by wearing a shirt that says you don't belong, you're actually drawing attention to yourself and making a statement. this creates an ironic situation where the wearer is essentially belonging by claiming not to belong.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface description of the t-shirt (step 1) contrasts with the implied meaning and irony of actually wearing such a shirt (step 2). this discrepancy between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm. the humor comes from the self-referential nature of the message - wearing a shirt that claims you don't fit in is itself a way of fitting in with a certain counterculture or mindset.

additionally, knowing this is attributed to chandler from the tv show ""friends"" adds context, as his character is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.

given these factors, i confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.",1

 MONICA: Just do it!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""i am convinced!"" this exclamation suggests enthusiasm or strong agreement.

step 2: true intention
considering this is chandler speaking (likely referring to the character from friends), and his known sarcastic personality, the ""oh oh"" at the beginning suggests a mocking or exaggerated tone. this, combined with the overly emphatic ""i am convinced!"", hints at insincerity or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems positive, the exaggerated language and the context of chandler's character strongly suggest that he's not actually convinced at all. instead, he's likely expressing disbelief or disagreement in a sarcastic manner.

",FRIENDS,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be mixed. the first part (""oh just like give a minute to wake up for this"") seems neutral or slightly negative. the second part (""ha ha! you lost the ring. you the worst best man ever!"") appears to be negative, with laughter followed by criticism.

step 2: true intention
analyzing the context and language style:
1. ""oh just like give a minute to wake up for this"" suggests chandler is not fully engaged or enthusiastic.
2. ""ha ha!"" indicates laughter, but in this context, it's likely not genuine amusement.
3. ""you lost the ring"" is stating a fact, but the way it's presented seems exaggerated.
4. ""you the worst best man ever!"" is an extreme statement, likely not meant literally.

the true intention appears to be chandler making a joke at someone else's expense, using exaggeration and mock criticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment initially appears negative, but the true intention is to make a humorous comment. the exaggerated criticism and the use of ""worst best man ever"" (a contradictory phrase) are clear indicators of sarcasm. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the show ""friends,"" which further supports this interpretation.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine, curious question. chandler is asking phoebe about a scientific fact, seemingly acknowledging her knowledge of unusual information. the phrase ""you know strange things"" could be seen as a compliment to phoebe's diverse knowledge.

step 2: true intention
however, considering this is chandler speaking (known for his sarcastic humor in the show ""friends""), and the absurdity of the question itself (the boiling point of brain is not common knowledge), it becomes clear that this is not a genuine inquiry. the true intention is likely to make a humorous jab at phoebe's tendency to know random, often bizarre facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward question, the true intention reveals a sarcastic comment disguised as a question. chandler is using verbal irony by asking an absurd question while implying that phoebe might actually know such an outlandish fact. this discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

step 2: however, this line is from the tv show ""friends"" and is spoken by chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor. in the context of the show, this line is likely not about an actual bunny, but rather a humorous or sarcastic comment about something else entirely.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, and considering chandler's character, this line is most probably meant to be sarcastic. it's likely a deadpan or ironic comment about a situation that has nothing to do with an actual bunny.

i'm outputting this result directly because the context provided doesn't give strong indications of sarcasm. the statement ""and you are gonna make them all disappear"" appears to be a straightforward comment, likely in response to a previous statement or action. without more context or clear markers of sarcasm (such as exaggerated tone, irony, or contradictory elements), this statement seems to be meant literally rather than sarcastically.",0
"CHANDLER: Wow you look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani","PERSON: [Laughs]
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. chandler is saying ""wow"" and making a compliment about mrs. tribbiani looking like her son. this would typically be seen as a flattering remark.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing this is from the tv show friends and understanding chandler's character, there's likely more to this statement. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. the fact that he's telling a mother she looks like her son (rather than the other way around) is unusual and potentially unflattering, as it might imply she looks masculine or older than expected.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention is likely to make a joke at mrs. tribbiani's expense. chandler is probably not genuinely complimenting her but rather making a sarcastic remark about her appearance in relation to her son.

given this analysis, and considering chandler's character and the context of the show:

since my confidence is less than 90%, i'll think through it step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. it's just a question about someone's makeup without any obvious positive or negative connotations.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's impossible to determine the true intention. this could be a genuine question, a compliment, or potentially sarcastic depending on the tone, situation, and relationship between the speakers.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's not enough information to compare surface sentiment with a true intention. the phrase is too ambiguous on its own to infer sarcasm or lack thereof.

given this analysis, i cannot confidently assign a label of ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"" to this input. more context would be needed to make an accurate determination.",0
CHANDLER: I'm sorry man there is never a good time to have to .. Stop catching on fire.,"JOEY: When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, it wouldn't matter. Now I got to be careful?
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

this line is from the tv show friends and is a classic example of chandler bing's sarcastic humor. the situation (someone catching on fire) is serious, but chandler's response is deliberately understated and casual, creating a humorous contrast. 

the phrase ""stop catching on fire"" is not something one would normally say, as catching on fire isn't typically a recurring or voluntary action. by phrasing it this way, as if it's a simple habit someone could just decide to stop, chandler is using irony to highlight the absurdity of the situation.

the initial ""i'm sorry man"" and ""there is never a good time"" set up a seemingly sincere tone, which is then subverted by the ridiculous suggestion to ""stop catching on fire,"" creating the sarcastic effect.

this kind of deadpan delivery of an absurd statement in response to a serious situation is a hallmark of sarcastic humor, particularly for chandler's character in friends.",1
CHANDLER: Joey's got a really bad hernia but its nothing that a laser eye surgery wont fix,"JOEY: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay  you that money back and I don't want that hanging on my head. Besides, soon as my insurance kicks in I' ll all the free operations I want. T'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or helpful. chandler is suggesting a solution (laser eye surgery) for joey's health problem (hernia).

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly absurd and nonsensical. a hernia is a condition where an organ pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle or tissue, typically in the abdominal area. laser eye surgery is a procedure to correct vision problems. these two medical issues are completely unrelated, and laser eye surgery would not help a hernia in any way.

step 3: compare and analyze
the mismatch between the surface sentiment (seemingly helpful suggestion) and the true intention (an obviously ridiculous and impossible solution) is a clear indicator of sarcasm. chandler is using this absurd statement to likely make a joke or express frustration about joey's condition in a humorous way.

"CHANDLER: See now that I see crying over, but Bambi, is a cartoon.","PHOEBE: You know whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two, cause on the thrid day my mother killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. chandler is comparing two situations - one that he sees as worthy of crying over (unnamed), and bambi, which he dismisses as ""just a cartoon."" the use of ""see now"" suggests he's contrasting these situations.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is likely to humorously downplay the emotional impact of bambi. by calling it ""just a cartoon,"" chandler is likely trying to appear tough or unemotional about a film that is famously sad and often makes people cry. this dismissive attitude towards a well-known tearjerker is probably meant to be funny.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively straightforward, the true intention reveals a layer of humor. chandler is likely aware that many people find bambi emotionally impactful, so his dismissal of it as ""just a cartoon"" is probably meant to be humorous rather than genuinely dismissive. this creates a contrast between the surface statement and the likely intended meaning.

however, while there's humor here, it doesn't quite reach the level of sarcasm. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with a mocking or contemptuous tone. here, chandler is being humorous, but he's not necessarily saying the opposite of what he means.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement is humorous but doesn't fully embody the characteristics of sarcasm. it's more of a deadpan or dry humor statement typical of chandler's character in ""friends.""",0
"CHANDLER: Because his penis was too big. I am sorry, thatÕs the kind of thing I do.","PERSON: I am sorry, why did Phoebe and Mike breakup?
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward, if crude, explanation for an unspecified situation. the mention of a ""penis being too big"" is typically seen as a positive attribute in colloquial speech. however, the follow-up statement ""i am sorry, that's the kind of thing i do"" suggests self-awareness of inappropriate behavior.

step 2: true intention
knowing this is a line from the character chandler in the tv show ""friends"", we can infer more context. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor and tendency to make jokes in uncomfortable situations. the true intention here is likely not to provide a genuine explanation, but rather to make a joke, possibly to deflect from a serious or awkward conversation.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, we can see a clear discrepancy. chandler is not actually sorry, nor is he providing a genuine explanation. he's using an outrageous statement to create humor, which is a classic sarcastic technique. the self-referential comment at the end further emphasizes his awareness of using sarcasm or inappropriate humor.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis confirms that this statement is indeed sarcastic, aligning with chandler's character and the context of the show.",1
"CHANDLER: Oh hurry up, I want to sign that.","PERSON: But that reminds me, sign this.
 ROSS: What is it?
 PERSON: Its nothing, just that you can't sue the city incase you scrap your knee or your know get your head blown off.
",FRIENDS,1,"given the context-free nature of this single line, i'll think through it step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or eager. chandler is expressing a desire to sign something quickly, which typically indicates enthusiasm or positive anticipation.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, given that this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor, there's a possibility that his eagerness might be insincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems straightforward, chandler's character traits and the potential for situational irony make it challenging to definitively label this as sarcastic or not sarcastic without more context.

given the limited information and chandler's tendency towards sarcasm, there's a slight lean towards potential sarcasm, but it's not conclusive enough to confidently label it as such.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" because, without additional context to clearly indicate otherwise, it's safer to interpret the statement at face value. however, i acknowledge that with more context, this interpretation could change.",0

 CHANDLER: Key is stuck in the lock.
 JOEY: I could fix it hold on hold on, watch out watch out.
 CHANDLER: It still doesn't work!
 JOEY: I am not finished.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. chandler uses phrases like ""nice job"" and ""quite the craftsman"" which are typically complimentary. the exclamation point also adds enthusiasm to the statement.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, given that this is a line from the tv show friends, and knowing chandler's character, there's a possibility that he's being sarcastic. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, often delivered in a seemingly sincere tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly positive, chandler's character and the nature of the show friends make it plausible that this could be a sarcastic comment. however, without more context about joey's craftsmanship or the specific situation, we can't be certain that this is sarcasm.

given the uncertainty and lack of clear indicators of sarcasm, i'll err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that with more context about the specific scene or episode, this interpretation could change.",0
CHANDLER: Well thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.,"CHANDLER: Hey, I need you to set me up for a joke. Later when Monica is around I need you to ask me about firetrucks
 JOEY: I don't know Chandler, I am not so good with remembering lines.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""thank god,"" which typically expresses relief or gratitude.

step 2: however, the true intention of chandler's statement is likely sarcastic. the phrase ""thank god"" is being used ironically here. chandler is implying that the person he's speaking to is not good at whatever task is being discussed, and it's fortunate that their job doesn't depend on this skill.

step 3: comparing the surface positive sentiment with the underlying critical message, we can infer that this statement is indeed sarcastic. chandler is using praise (""thank god"") to actually convey criticism, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

 MONICA: We have to unscrew the chain
 JOEY: Hurry, I can't feel my ears
 CHANDLER: Can you ever feel your ears?
 JOEY: Interesting
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems frustrated or exasperated. chandler says he doesn't have tools, which on the surface appears to be a straightforward statement.

step 2: true intention
however, the first part of chandler's statement, ""oh i left them in my bulldozer,"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally. it's highly unlikely that chandler actually owns a bulldozer, and even if he did, it wouldn't be a typical place to store tools. this exaggerated, absurd statement is a classic setup for sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the absurd first statement and the straightforward second statement creates a sarcastic tone. chandler is using hyperbole (the bulldozer reference) to emphasize the fact that he doesn't have tools in a humorous, sarcastic way. this is typical of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor.

### label: sarcastic",1
"CHANDLER: We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.","JOEY: Quack quack, quack quack, quack quack.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be understanding and positive. the phrase ""now we understand"" suggests that chandler and others have gained clarity about a situation. the tone seems supportive of someone taking time to do something (presumably creating a gift).

step 2: however, considering this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor, we need to look deeper. the phrase ""what was taking so long"" implies impatience or frustration with waiting. the way he says ""now we understand you were doing this"" could be interpreted as mocking or belittling the effort put into the gift, especially if ""this"" refers to something underwhelming.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there's a clear discrepancy. chandler is probably not genuinely understanding or impressed. instead, he's likely using a seemingly positive statement to express disappointment or criticism about the time taken versus the result. this is a classic sarcastic technique.

given chandler's character and the context clues, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
CHANDLER: Oh tons. I am quite the woodsman.,"CHANDLER: Okay, lets find these birds.

 CHANDLER: how?
 JOEY: Maybe we can lure them out, you know of any bird calls?
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. chandler is claiming to be ""quite the woodsman"" and says he has ""tons"" of experience, which on the surface seems like a confident, positive statement about his abilities.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing chandler's character from the tv show friends, this is likely not his true intention. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor and self-deprecation. he's not typically portrayed as outdoorsy or skilled in wilderness activities. the exaggerated ""oh tons"" and the somewhat formal ""quite the woodsman"" phrase seem out of character if meant sincerely.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment (confident, positive) contrasts with what we can infer about chandler's true abilities and typical way of speaking. this mismatch, combined with chandler's known tendency for sarcasm, strongly suggests that he's being sarcastic here. he's likely exaggerating or completely fabricating his woodsman skills for humorous effect.

### label: sarcastic",1
CHANDLER: If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.,"JOEY: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
",FRIENDS,1,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat negative or critical. the phrase ""if only there was something in your head"" suggests a lack or deficiency, which is typically not a positive statement.

step 2: true intention
this sentence is actually a sarcastic remark. chandler is implying that the person he's talking to lacks the ability to think before speaking. the phrase ""something in your head"" is a euphemism for a brain or intelligence. by saying ""if only,"" chandler is sarcastically suggesting that the person doesn't have this ability, when in reality, everyone does have a brain to control what they say.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention goes beyond simple criticism. the use of ""if only"" to point out an obvious biological fact (that everyone has a brain) is a clear indicator of sarcasm. chandler is not literally suggesting that the person lacks a brain, but rather criticizing their behavior in a clever, indirect way.

given this analysis, we can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1
"CHANDLER: Well yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.","ROSS: So uh, does it do anything uh special?
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward, factual statement about chandler's third nipple having magical properties.

step 2: the true intention is clearly not literal. this statement is absurd and impossible, referencing the fictional world of narnia. chandler is using hyperbole and fantasy to mock the idea of a third nipple having any special function.

step 3: comparing the surface statement (a seemingly serious claim about magical nipple powers) with the true intention (mocking the concept through absurd exaggeration), it's clear this is sarcasm. chandler is using over-the-top imagery to sarcastically dismiss whatever was previously said about his third nipple.

the use of deadpan delivery of an obviously false and fantastical statement is a classic form of sarcasm, especially typical of chandler's character in the show ""friends"". therefore, this statement is definitely sarcastic.",1
"CHANDLER: I am sorry, we donÕt have your sheep.","RACHEL: Hey
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly apologetic. chandler is saying ""i am sorry"" and stating that they don't have someone's sheep. there are no obviously sarcastic keywords or phrases, and no emojis or other indicators of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. the context is crucial here. in a normal conversation, people don't typically discuss missing sheep, so this statement is likely absurd or out of place. the true intention is probably to make a joke or respond to an unusual situation with humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is straightforward, the context and the absurdity of the statement suggest that this is likely a sarcastic or humorous remark. chandler is probably not actually apologizing for not having someone's sheep, but rather making a witty comment about an unusual situation or misunderstanding.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the absurdity of the statement in a normal context, combined with chandler's character traits, strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic remark rather than a genuine apology about missing sheep.",1
"CHANDLER: No, rabies.","CHANDLER: What what?
 JOEY: Hey, shaving?
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll think through this step-by-step to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the word ""rabies"" is associated with a serious and dangerous disease, which generally carries a negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact intention. however, this appears to be a snippet from a conversation, likely from the tv show ""friends"" given that chandler is speaking. chandler is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. the abruptness and seeming non sequitur of ""no, rabies"" suggests it's not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely intention, there's a clear mismatch. the statement ""no, rabies"" is almost certainly not meant to be taken at face value. it's likely a sarcastic or humorous response to an unheard question or statement, possibly dismissing or mocking whatever was previously said.

given chandler's character and the nature of the response, this statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic, using an absurd answer (rabies) for comedic effect.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate classification for this statement.",1
CHANDLER: Was that place the sun?,"CHANDLER: Hold on, there is something different.
 ROSS: I went to their tanning place your wife suggested.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment of this statement appears to be a genuine question. chandler is asking if a place was the sun, which on its face seems like a straightforward inquiry.

step 2: however, the true intention of this statement is likely not a genuine question. it's impossible for a place to literally be the sun, so chandler is probably using hyperbole or exaggeration to make a point about the characteristics of a place he's referring to.

step 3: comparing the surface question with the impossibility of the literal meaning, we can infer that chandler is using sarcasm. he's likely implying that the place was extremely hot, bright, or uncomfortable, to the point where he's sarcastically comparing it to the sun itself.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement ""maybe he was nervous"" appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic suggestion. chandler is offering a possible explanation for someone's behavior, and there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this short, simple statement. the tone seems genuinely considerate and speculative rather than mocking or ironic.",0

 CHANDLER: I don't know. I can't . I just, I can't get her out of my head you know. I am a very bad person. I am a horrible person.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""we still love you"" and the reassuring tone of ""no you are not chandler"" (assuming this is in response to chandler expressing self-doubt or criticism).

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be comfort and reassurance. however, there's an odd element here - addressing chandler in the third person while seemingly talking to him directly. this creates a slightly humorous or playful tone, which could potentially be interpreted as gentle teasing or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the overall message is supportive, the unusual phrasing (talking about chandler to chandler) introduces an element of humor that could be construed as mild sarcasm. however, without more context, it's difficult to definitively say if this is intended as sarcasm or just a playful way of offering reassurance.

given the ambiguity and the fact that the supportive message seems genuine despite the unusual phrasing, i'm inclined to err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a playful element to the phrasing, the overall intention appears to be genuine reassurance rather than sarcasm.",0

i can confidently classify this statement as ""not sarcastic"" without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the sentence ""i was saying the actual words"" is a straightforward statement from chandler (likely a character from the tv show ""friends""). there's no indication of sarcasm, irony, or any hidden meaning in this simple declaration. chandler is merely stating that he was speaking literally, which is a direct and honest communication without any sarcastic undertones.",0
CHANDLER: His legs flail about as if independent from his body,"ROSS: According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejesus out of him?
 MONICA: Michael flatly lord of the dance
 ROSS: That is correct!
 JOEY: The Irish gig guy?
",FRIENDS,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment of this statement is neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""legs flail about"" suggests uncontrolled or awkward movement, which could be seen as a negative description. the comparison ""as if independent from his body"" adds an element of oddity or unusualness to the description.

step 2: this sentence is likely a humorous description of someone's dancing or movement style. the exaggerated language and vivid imagery (""flail about"", ""independent from his body"") suggest that this is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a comedic observation. the statement appears to be from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler often makes witty, exaggerated comments.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that while the description sounds negative on the surface, it's actually meant to be funny rather than critical. the exaggeration is used for comedic effect, not to convey genuine criticism or negativity. this type of humorous exaggeration is a common form of friendly teasing or observational comedy, but it doesn't quite reach the level of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

while the statement is humorous and exaggerated, it doesn't appear to be saying the opposite of what is meant, which is a key component of sarcasm. instead, it's using hyperbole for comedic effect, making it witty but not sarcastic.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement from chandler doesn't appear to be sarcastic. it seems to be a straightforward explanation or correction about the concept of time travel. the tone is matter-of-fact and doesn't contain any obvious irony or contradiction between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm. chandler is likely responding to someone's comment about inability to do something, clarifying that while they can't go back in time, they can do the thing in question.",0
CHANDLER: Did I wake you?,"CHANDLER: Are you kidding me? Joey Joey Joey Joey!

this short line from chandler in the tv show ""friends"" appears to be a straightforward question without any sarcastic undertones. chandler is simply asking if he woke someone up, likely after calling or arriving somewhere. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the phrasing or context provided, so it's most likely meant to be taken at face value as a genuine inquiry.",0

 MONICA: I don't think I have enough quarters
 PHOEBE: I have quarters!
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

chandler's statement is clearly sarcastic. the surface enthusiasm about doing laundry all night contrasts sharply with the reality that most people would find this boring or undesirable. 

key sarcastic elements:
1. exaggerated excitement (""great!"")
2. repetition of ""all night"" for emphasis
3. treating a mundane chore (laundry) as if it's an exciting activity

chandler, known for his sarcastic humor in friends, is using verbal irony here. he's saying the opposite of what he really means, expressing fake enthusiasm about an unexciting prospect to highlight how unappealing it actually is.

this is a classic example of sarcasm used for comedic effect.",1
"CHANDLER: ThatÕs a good one too Pheebs, now all that I have to do is find a plane load of people whose resolution is to plummet to their deaths","PHOEBE: That's a good one. Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance with phrases like ""good one"" and ""resolution"". however, the mention of ""plummet to their deaths"" introduces a stark negative element.

step 2: true intention
chandler's response is clearly not meant to be taken literally. he's using dark humor to respond to something phoebe (referred to as ""pheebs"") said earlier. the juxtaposition of a ""good"" idea with finding people who want to die in a plane crash is absurd and not meant seriously.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positivity (""good one"") is completely undermined by the dark content of the rest of the statement. this stark contrast between the apparent approval and the morbid suggestion is a classic indicator of sarcasm. chandler is known for his sarcastic wit in the show ""friends"", and this line is very much in character for him.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

"CHANDLER: You know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.","CHANDLER: What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. chandler uses the word ""amusing,"" which typically has a positive connotation. however, he contrasts this with finding it ""regular,"" which is more neutral.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show friends, where chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. the contrast between ""amusing"" and ""regular"" is intentional. by saying he finds something ""regular"" that others might find ""amusing,"" chandler is actually implying that he doesn't find it amusing at all. this understatement is a classic sarcastic technique.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention is to convey disapproval or lack of amusement through understatement. the contrast between what ""some might find"" and what chandler claims to find is the key to the sarcasm here. he's essentially saying, ""this isn't actually amusing at all.""

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be confusion or disbelief, with chandler questioning someone's dating choice.

step 2: the true intention is to mock or ridicule the name ""hornswoggle"" by comparing it to a character from a children's puppet show (""fraggle rock""). chandler isn't genuinely asking if the person is dating a fraggle rock character; he's using this comparison to emphasize how ridiculous he finds the name.

step 3: the sarcasm comes from the deliberate exaggeration and the absurd comparison. chandler doesn't actually believe the person is dating a puppet; he's using this hyperbole to make fun of the name. the ""ahh"" at the end also suggests a sarcastic tone.

the contrast between the literal question and the implied mockery, along with the exaggerated comparison, clearly indicates that this is a sarcastic statement.",1
"CHANDLER: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?","CHANDLER: How old is that sock!. If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years, it would be talking too.
 ROSS: Okay, I think its time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears serious and concerning. chandler states that he killed joey for eating his last stick of gum, which is an extreme overreaction. the question ""do you think that was wrong?"" suggests potential doubt about the morality of this action.

step 2: true intention
this statement is clearly not meant to be taken literally. it's a hyperbolic joke typical of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends."" the extreme overreaction to a minor incident (eating gum) is intentionally absurd. chandler is using dark humor to express mild annoyance at joey, not actually confessing to murder.

step 3: analysis and inference
the massive disconnect between the trivial nature of eating someone's gum and the extreme ""consequence"" of murder creates an absurd scenario that's clearly not meant to be taken seriously. the deadpan delivery of such an outrageous statement, followed by a nonchalant question about its morality, is a classic sarcastic technique.

 ROSS: Well what? What were you doing seeing her boobies?
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be defensive. chandler is saying it was an accident and denying a specific scenario.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to use exaggeration and absurdity to make light of the situation. by providing an oddly specific and ridiculous scenario (being across the street with a telescope and donuts), chandler is actually drawing attention to the fact that his actions were deliberate, not accidental.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface-level denial contrasts sharply with the absurd scenario chandler presents. this contrast is a classic sarcastic technique. by offering such an outlandish alternative, chandler is actually implying that his actions were intentional, while verbally claiming they were accidental. this ironic contrast between what is said and what is meant is a hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using humor and exaggeration to deflect from his actual intentions, which is a common use of sarcasm in sitcom dialogue, especially for his character in ""friends.""",1

the surface sentiment appears neutral or slightly positive. chandler is making a statement about a word, ""joincidence,"" which seems to be a play on words.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to make a joke by creating a nonsensical word. ""joincidence"" is likely a combination of ""join"" and ""coincidence,"" with chandler emphasizing that it starts with a ""c"" instead of the expected ""co-"" prefix.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention is humorous. chandler is deliberately using wordplay to create a silly, made-up word. this kind of intentional misuse of language to create humor is a common form of sarcasm, especially in sitcom dialogue (this line is from the tv show ""friends"").

the sarcasm here is subtle but present in the deliberate misuse of language for comedic effect. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the show, and this line is consistent with his character's style of wit.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this statement.",1
"CHANDLER: The Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see King George is giving us the land, so.","CHANDLER: Rach rach, we gotta settle
 RACHEL: Settle what?
",FRIENDS,1,"to analyze this statement for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. chandler is presenting information about the jamestown colony and king george giving land, which on its face doesn't indicate any strong emotion or sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
knowing this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" and considering his character's tendency for sarcasm, we need to look deeper. the statement is likely not meant to be taken at face value. the use of ""you see"" and the overly simplistic explanation of a complex historical event suggest chandler is probably not being entirely serious.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the oversimplification of colonial history and chandler's typical speaking style suggest this is likely a sarcastic comment. he's probably making a joke about the complexities of colonialism by presenting it in an absurdly simplified manner.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
"CHANDLER: Dear god, this parachute is a knapsack","MONICA: Why wouldn't I be married when I am forty?
 CHANDLER: Oh no no no, I just meant hypothetically
 MONICA: Ok , hypothetically, why won't I be married when I am forty?
 CHANDLER: No
 MONICA: No, what is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be one of alarm or concern. the phrase ""dear god"" is often used to express shock or worry. the statement about the parachute being a knapsack implies a potentially dangerous situation.

step 2: this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" spoken by the character chandler, who is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. in context, chandler is probably not actually in a situation where he needs a parachute. the true intention is to make a humorous observation, possibly about something that looks like it should be one thing (a parachute) but is actually another (a knapsack).

step 3: comparing the surface alarm with the likely context and chandler's character, this statement is clearly not meant to be taken literally. it's a classic example of chandler's dry, sarcastic humor, where he's making a joke by pretending to be in a dire situation when he's not.

### label: sarcastic",1
"CHANDLER: Oh yeah ok, including the waffles last week, you now owe me, seventeen zillion dollars.","JOEY: Hey, Chan. Can you help me out here, I promise I'll pay you back.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be serious. chandler is stating a large debt owed to him, including specific items like waffles. the use of a precise number (""seventeen zillion"") might initially seem like a factual statement.

step 2: true intention
however, ""seventeen zillion"" is not a real number. it's an exaggeration used for comedic effect. this hyperbole, combined with the casual mention of waffles contributing to such an astronomical sum, indicates that chandler is not being serious about the debt.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of a serious debt claim contrasts sharply with the true intention of making a joke through exaggeration. this deliberate mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a classic indicator of sarcasm. chandler is using hyperbole to humorously emphasize that the other person owes him, but not literally expecting payment of ""seventeen zillion dollars.""

based on this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

"CHANDLER: No, no, I am just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.","CHANDLER: Anybody know a good tailor?
 JOEY: You needs some clothes altered?
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be straightforward and literal. chandler is stating that he's looking for a man to draw on him with chalk. there are no overtly sentimental words or phrases, and no emojis.

step 2: true intention
however, considering this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor, and the unusual nature of the request, it's highly unlikely that he actually wants someone to draw on him with chalk. the true intention is likely to sarcastically respond to a previous statement or question, probably dismissing or mocking whatever was said before.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface meaning (step 1) is absurd and doesn't align with normal behavior or requests. the true intention (step 2) is to use this absurdity to create a sarcastic response. the mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

given chandler's character, the context of the show, and the nature of the statement, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1
"CHANDLER: I am telling you, when she leaned back, I could see her brain","CHANDLER: Hey

 MONICA: Why
 ROSS: Don't tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward statement. chandler is claiming he could see someone's brain when they leaned back. there are no obviously sarcastic keywords or phrases, and no emojis to indicate tone.

step 2: true intention
in reality, it's impossible to see someone's brain through their head. this statement is likely an exaggeration used for comedic effect. chandler, a character known for his sarcastic and witty remarks in the tv show ""friends,"" is probably making a joke about someone being unintelligent or ""empty-headed.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement seems literal, the true intention is to make a humorous, exaggerated claim. the impossibility of the statement, combined with chandler's typical speech patterns, strongly suggests this is meant to be a sarcastic comment about someone's intelligence.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly an exaggeration used for comedic effect, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic.""",1
CHANDLER: Me? I am gonna die alone!,"RACHEL: Hey Chandler? Monica just broke my sea-shell lamp.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll think through this step-by-step to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and pessimistic. the phrase ""i am gonna die alone!"" expresses a bleak outlook on one's future romantic prospects.

step 2: true intention
however, this line is from the character chandler in the tv show friends. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor and self-deprecating jokes. in the context of the show, this line is likely delivered with chandler's typical dry, sarcastic tone. he's probably exaggerating for comedic effect rather than genuinely believing he will die alone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention is likely to be humorous. chandler often uses hyperbole and self-mockery as a form of sarcasm. the extreme nature of the statement (""die alone"") further suggests it's not meant to be taken literally.

given chandler's character traits and the exaggerated nature of the statement, this line is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine expression of despair. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1
CHANDLER: Spanish midgets wrestling Julie! Okay yes I see how they got there.,"ROSS: Man, I sure miss Julie
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: not sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly confused. there are no strong emotional keywords or sentimental phrases. the statement ""okay yes i see how they got there"" indicates a sense of realization or understanding.

step 2: true intention
this appears to be a line from the tv show ""friends,"" spoken by the character chandler. he's likely responding to something unusual or unexpected that he's just heard or seen. the true intention seems to be genuine surprise or confusion, followed by a moment of comprehension.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's no significant difference between the surface sentiment and the true intention. chandler is expressing genuine surprise at first, then acknowledging that he understands the connection or reasoning behind whatever bizarre situation he's referring to (spanish midgets wrestling julie). this is typical of chandler's character - making dry observations about unusual situations.

while chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, this particular line doesn't appear to be sarcastic. he's not saying the opposite of what he means, nor is he using irony to mock or criticize. instead, he's expressing genuine, if bemused, understanding.

therefore, i conclude that this statement is not sarcastic. it's an unusual observation, but it's meant to be taken at face value.",0

 JOEY: Oh man! You are so wearing that bracelet!
 CHANDLER: I so am
 JOEY: You have any idea what this will do to your sex life?
",FRIENDS,1,"to properly analyze this statement for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. chandler is discussing adapting to a change, suggesting he'll initially slow down but then get ""back on track."" the tone seems matter-of-fact and practical.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, knowing this is from the tv show ""friends"" and chandler's character tendency towards sarcasm, there's a possibility that he's not being entirely serious. the phrase ""extra weight"" could be a metaphor for something burdensome or unpleasant.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is straightforward, chandler's character and the potentially metaphorical language suggest there might be an undercurrent of sarcasm. however, without more context, it's challenging to be certain.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic markers, i'm inclined to err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification has lower confidence due to the lack of context and knowledge of the specific situation chandler is referring to. in a different context or with more information, this statement could potentially be sarcastic.",0
"CHANDLER: A lonely grey couch. "" O look "" cried Ned. And then the kingdom was his. The End.","CHANDLER: It was summer. And it was hot. Rachel was there.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the sarcasm in this case isn't immediately clear.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral to slightly positive. there's no overtly positive or negative language. the phrase ""o look"" suggests a moment of discovery or interest. the ending ""and then the kingdom was his"" could be seen as a positive outcome for ned.

step 2: true intention
this text appears to be chandler (likely from the tv show ""friends"") reciting or making up a very short, simplistic story. the abrupt nature of the story, its nonsensical progression, and the overly simplistic ending suggest that chandler is intentionally telling a poor or ridiculous story. this is likely meant to be humorous by virtue of how bad or nonsensical the story is.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, the true intention appears to be mockery of simplistic storytelling or perhaps a comment on chandler's poor storytelling abilities. the disconnect between the seemingly earnest surface and the likely intention to be humorously bad indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the abrupt, oversimplified nature of the story, coupled with it being told by chandler (a character known for his sarcastic humor), strongly suggests this is a sarcastic attempt at storytelling rather than a genuine effort.",1
CHANDLER: See Joe that's why your parents told you not to jump on your bed!,"JOEY: Whoa!
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll walk through my thought process to be thorough:

step 1: on the surface, this sentence appears to be offering a straightforward explanation or advice about not jumping on beds, referencing parental warnings.

step 2: however, considering this is chandler speaking (a character known for his sarcasm), and the context of a sitcom dialogue, it's likely that this statement is not meant to be taken literally. the true intention is probably to make a humorous comment about an unexpected or ridiculous situation that joey has found himself in, which is only tangentially related to jumping on beds.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (seemingly sincere advice) with the likely true intention (making a joke at joey's expense about an absurd situation), we can conclude that this statement is indeed sarcastic. chandler is using the format of parental advice to humorously comment on whatever predicament joey is in, which is likely not actually related to bed-jumping.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this statement.",1
"CHANDLER: I just have to do one thing, really quickly, its not a big thing  ...  GET UP||","CHANDLER: Get up

 JOEY: Whats the big deal?
 CHANDLER: The big deal is that I was sitting there last, so.. that's my seat
 JOEY: Actually, the last place you were sitting was in there
 ROSS: You guys, you know what? it doesn't matter. Because you both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops!
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

chandler's statement starts off downplaying what he's about to do, using phrases like ""just have to do one thing,"" ""really quickly,"" and ""not a big thing."" this sets up an expectation that whatever he's about to do is minor and unimportant.

however, he then abruptly shifts to shouting ""get up!!"" in all caps, which is a dramatic contrast to the calm, casual tone he established at the beginning. this sudden shift in tone and the forceful command create the sarcastic effect.

the sarcasm comes from the mismatch between how chandler initially frames his action (as something small and quick) and the actual urgency and importance of what he wants (for someone to get up immediately). this kind of misdirection and contrast is a classic sarcastic technique, especially common in sitcom dialogue like what we'd expect from chandler in ""friends.""",1
"CHANDLER: No, this is just part of a daredevil game that I play called wait until last moment before I burst and die","PERSON: Someone in there?
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or distressed. key phrases like ""daredevil game,"" ""wait until last moment,"" and ""burst and die"" suggest danger, risk, and extreme discomfort.

step 2: true intention
this sentence is likely not meant to be taken literally. chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends,"" is probably not actually playing a dangerous game. instead, he's likely exaggerating a mundane situation (perhaps needing to use the bathroom) by describing it in dramatic, life-threatening terms.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the extreme mismatch between the dramatic language used and what is likely a ordinary situation, combined with chandler's character tendency, strongly indicates this is a sarcastic statement. he's using hyperbole to humorously describe a common, non-life-threatening discomfort or urgency.

"CHANDLER: Yes, we all know how cruel a parent can be, about the flatness of a child's pillow.","MONICA: I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be serious, discussing parental cruelty regarding a child's pillow flatness. the use of words like ""cruel"" and the seemingly earnest tone suggest a serious statement about parental behavior.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clear. the idea of a parent being cruel about something as trivial as pillow flatness is absurd. this exaggeration and focus on an insignificant detail is a classic sarcastic technique.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (serious discussion of parental cruelty) with the true intention (highlighting the absurdity of considering pillow flatness as cruel), it's evident that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker, chandler, is known for his sarcastic humor in the context of the tv show ""friends,"" which further supports this classification.

the use of hyperbole (exaggerating the cruelty of parents over such a minor issue) is a clear indicator of sarcasm, making this statement definitively sarcastic.",1
CHANDLER: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.,"JOEY: I just want to go back to my cell, cause in my cell I can smoke.
 CHANDLER: Smoke away!
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the statement references someone (damone) smoking alone in a cell, which implies a solitary and potentially unpleasant situation.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. the context suggests that chandler is making a joke about someone's behavior being so annoying or unpleasant that it would drive even a prison inmate to isolate themselves.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment doesn't convey much emotion, but the true intention is to make a humorous, exaggerated comparison. chandler is using a hyperbolic example (a prisoner smoking alone) to comment on someone's behavior in a witty, roundabout way. this discrepancy between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses an exaggerated comparison to make a humorous point, which is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic wit in the show ""friends.""",1
CHANDLER: Oh! Satan's minions at work again?,"PHOEBE: And there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the mention of ""satan's minions,"" which typically has a negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. the question format and the exaggerated reference to ""satan's minions"" suggest that chandler is not seriously believing in demonic activity. instead, he's likely making a joke about something mundane or slightly annoying happening.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface negativity (mentioning satan's minions) contrasts with the likely trivial nature of the actual situation chandler is commenting on. this mismatch between the exaggerated language and the probable reality is a classic indicator of sarcasm. chandler is using hyperbole to humorously comment on a situation, not literally suggesting demonic involvement.

given chandler's character and the nature of the statement, this is almost certainly a sarcastic comment, hence the ""sarcastic"" label.",1
"CHANDLER: Maybe it's a contest, you know? Like ""Collect all five"".","PHOEBE: I know, I opened it up and it  and there it was just floathing in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral or slightly positive. chandler is suggesting a potentially fun or interesting idea about a contest or collection.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing chandler's character from the tv show friends, and his typical sarcastic tone, we can infer that he's not actually suggesting a real contest. the phrase ""collect all five"" is likely referring to something negative or undesirable in the context of the conversation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between the seemingly positive surface suggestion of a contest and the likely negative context it's being applied to is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. chandler is probably making light of a bad situation by sarcastically comparing it to a collection game or contest, implying that whatever they're discussing is actually unpleasant or problematic.

given chandler's well-known sarcastic personality and the structure of this comment, it's highly likely that this statement is meant to be sarcastic rather than a genuine suggestion.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this input.",1
CHANDLER: I guess you would know that or else we would be in a predicament room,"CHANDLER: Listen it's kind of an emergency
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly confused. the phrase ""i guess"" indicates uncertainty, and ""predicament room"" is an unusual term that doesn't have a clear positive or negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
this sentence appears to be a play on words, likely referencing the more common phrase ""emergency room."" the speaker (chandler) is using wordplay to create humor by substituting ""predicament"" for ""emergency."" this kind of clever wordplay is characteristic of sarcasm or dry humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is fairly neutral, the underlying intention is to be humorous through wordplay. the incongruity between the serious topic of emergency rooms and the playful substitution of ""predicament"" creates a sarcastic tone. this is typical of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic and witty remarks.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
CHANDLER: We can? Ok I am trying that.,"RACHEL: You guys can pee standing up.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear and sarcasm often relies heavily on tone and broader context.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. chandler is expressing agreement (""we can?"") and willingness to try something (""ok i am trying that.""). there are no obvious sentimental keywords or phrases, and no emojis present.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcastic intent. chandler's response seems straightforward - he's confirming something is possible and agreeing to try it. however, knowing chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" he often uses a sarcastic tone even when saying seemingly innocent things.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the limited context and lack of obvious sarcastic indicators, we can't confidently say this is sarcastic. while chandler is known for sarcasm, this particular line doesn't provide enough evidence to classify it as such. the surface meaning and likely true intention appear to align.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" because there isn't enough contextual evidence to indicate sarcasm. however, i acknowledge that with more context or knowledge of the tone used, this interpretation could change.",0
CHANDLER: Oh yeah right. And what would my opening line be? Excuse me,"MONICA: Go over to her. She's not with anyone.
",FRIENDS,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or dismissive, indicated by phrases like ""oh yeah right"" and the questioning tone of ""and what would my opening line be?""

step 2: true intention
this line is from the character chandler in the tv show friends. chandler is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or disagreement. the rhetorical question that follows (""and what would my opening line be?"") suggests that chandler finds the idea ridiculous or implausible.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface dismissiveness aligns with a sarcastic intent. chandler is using sarcasm to express his lack of confidence or discomfort with the situation (likely related to approaching someone). the rhetorical question emphasizes his sarcastic tone, implying that he doesn't believe he would have a good opening line.

given chandler's character traits and the context of the dialogue, i can conclude with high confidence that this statement is sarcastic.

CHANDLER: Ah you see perfect might be a problem. Had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.,"PERSON: Because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive with the use of the word ""perfect,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: however, chandler's true intention is to imply that ""perfect"" is actually problematic or undesirable. he contrasts it with negative traits like ""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive,"" suggesting that these would have been more acceptable or expected responses.

step 3: the disconnect between the surface-level use of a positive word (""perfect"") and the implication that it's actually a negative trait is a classic sarcastic structure. chandler is using verbal irony to convey his actual meaning, which is opposite to the literal meaning of his words.

this is very characteristic of chandler's speech pattern in the show ""friends,"" where he frequently uses sarcasm and irony for comedic effect. the statement is clearly meant to be humorous by subverting expectations, which further supports the sarcastic classification.",1

 JOEY: Yes I am, as of today, I am official Joey Tribbiani actor slash model.
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or amusing, with chandler saying ""that's so funny"" at the beginning of the sentence. this phrase typically indicates something humorous or entertaining.

step 2: true intention
however, the rest of the sentence reveals that chandler is actually making a mocking comment about someone's appearance, comparing them unfavorably to ""joey tribbiani man slash woman."" this is likely a dig at the person's gender ambiguity or lack of clear masculine/feminine traits. the true intention is to insult or mock, not to genuinely express amusement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the initial positive phrase ""that's so funny"" and the subsequent insulting comparison creates a clear disconnect. this is a classic structure for sarcasm, where the speaker says one thing (""that's funny"") but means the opposite (it's not actually funny, it's insulting). the use of exaggeration (""man slash woman"") further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly meant to be taken ironically, with chandler using a seemingly positive opening to deliver a mocking insult, which is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.",1
"CHANDLER: No, no the actual cartoon character .. Of course the baloon.","CHANDLER: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has gotten away.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break down my thought process to illustrate why:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward question and answer. chandler seems to be clarifying whether he's referring to an actual cartoon character or a balloon.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we examine the language style:
- the phrase ""of course the balloon"" is a key indicator of sarcasm.
- the structure of the sentence, starting with a seemingly serious statement (""no, no the actual cartoon character"") followed by an abrupt contradiction, is a classic sarcastic technique.
- the context (assuming this is from the tv show friends) also supports that this is likely chandler's characteristic sarcastic humor.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (a simple clarification) with the true intention (making a sarcastic remark), it's clear that this statement is meant to be sarcastic. chandler is using irony to emphasize that he obviously means the balloon, not a literal cartoon character.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this input.",1
CHANDLER: That monkey has got a Ross on its ass!,"CHANDLER: Hey!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of amusement or surprise. the exclamation ""that monkey has got a ross on its ass!"" suggests an unexpected or humorous observation. there are no explicitly negative or positive emotional keywords, but the tone seems lighthearted.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" spoken by the character chandler, who is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. in this context, chandler is probably making a joke about his friend ross, comparing him to something on a monkey's behind. the true intention is to be funny by making an absurd comparison.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is one of surprise or amusement, the true intention aligns with this. chandler is genuinely trying to be funny, not conveying a hidden meaning opposite to his words. the statement is meant to be taken as a joke, but not in a sarcastic way that contradicts its surface meaning.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

this statement is a joke, but it doesn't employ sarcasm. it's a straightforward, albeit unusual, observation meant to be humorous without relying on saying the opposite of what is meant.",0

in this case, i believe my judgment is reliable without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the statement by chandler appears to be a straightforward declaration of his intention to be honest if asked about something. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this context. the tone seems sincere and direct, which is consistent with chandler's character in the show ""friends"" when he's being earnest rather than sarcastic. therefore, i confidently classify this statement as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"CHANDLER: Oh, um, I don't care!","JOEY: How do I look?
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or dismissive. the phrase ""i don't care"" typically expresses indifference or lack of interest. the interjection ""oh, um"" at the beginning suggests some hesitation or uncertainty.

step 2: true intention
in the context of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" this line is likely delivered with a specific tone and body language. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor and often uses a dismissive tone to mask his true feelings. the ""oh, um"" prefix suggests he might actually care but is trying to appear nonchalant.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there's a discrepancy. while chandler says he doesn't care, it's probable that he does care but is using sarcasm to deflect or hide his real feelings. this is a common trait of his character.

given chandler's character traits and the typical use of such phrases in sitcom contexts, i'm inclined to classify this as sarcastic.

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break down my thought process to explain why:

step 1: on the surface, this appears to be a straightforward, informative statement. chandler seems to be providing helpful advice about not needing to knock once you're already inside a place.

step 2: however, when we consider the context and chandler's character (known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show friends), it becomes clear that this is not meant to be taken literally. the true intention is to point out something that should be obvious in a humorous way.

step 3: the sarcasm comes from stating something extremely obvious as if it were helpful advice. the surface meaning (informative statement) contrasts with the true intention (making a joke about unnecessarily stating the obvious), which is a classic structure for sarcasm.

given chandler's character and the nature of the statement, this is almost certainly meant to be sarcastic.",1

this line from chandler (likely referring to the tv show ""friends"") doesn't appear to contain any sarcasm. it's a straightforward statement about an observation or interpretation of something trying to spell out the word ""monkey."" there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems to be meant literally and at face value.",0
CHANDLER: Dee. The sarcastic sister from What's Happening.,"CHANDLER: Could you want her more?
 ROSS: Who?
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this quote appears to be a straightforward reference to a character from a tv show. chandler is likely genuinely recalling or mentioning the character dee from the sitcom ""what's happening!!"", who was known for her sarcastic personality. there's no apparent contrast between the surface meaning and the intended meaning, nor any obvious use of irony or sarcasm in the statement itself. it's simply a factual reference to a character known for sarcasm, but the statement itself is not sarcastic.",0
"CHANDLER: Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved and not they're all recommending Trident?","ROSS: Who?
 CHANDLER: Dee, the sarcastic sister from What's Happening!!
 RACHEL: Guys, guess what guess what guess what.
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure a reliable classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion. the phrase ""the fifth dentist caved"" suggests a change in a previously established situation. the use of ""uh, okay"" at the beginning indicates uncertainty or hesitation.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely referencing the common advertising claim that ""4 out of 5 dentists recommend"" a particular product. the humor lies in the idea that the previously holdout dentist has finally agreed, making it a unanimous recommendation. the true intention is to make a joke about advertising clichés and the absurdity of such claims.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment shows confusion, the underlying intention is to be humorous by exaggerating and mocking a common advertising trope. the discrepancy between the apparent confusion and the clever critique of advertising practices indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

this line from chandler (likely from the tv show ""friends"") is characteristic of his sarcastic humor, using irony to comment on the absurdity of advertising claims.",1

",FRIENDS,1,"### response:

i believe my judgment is reliable for this input, so i will output the result directly.

### label: not sarcastic

this line from chandler (likely referring to the character from the tv show ""friends"") doesn't appear to be sarcastic. while chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, this particular quote seems to be a straightforward observation or comment about someone else's actions, describing it as ""vigilante justice."" the phrase ""your own brand of"" is often used sincerely to describe someone's unique approach to something. without more context, there's no clear indication of sarcasm in this statement.",0
CHANDLER: Did you tell her about the magical night that starts with the flush of every toilet?,"CHANDLER: So Ross, how was the date the other night?
",FRIENDS,1,"i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or magical due to the phrase ""magical night"". however, this is immediately contrasted with the unusual and decidedly unromantic image of flushing toilets.

step 2: true intention
chandler's true intention appears to be mocking or belittling the idea of a romantic or magical night. by associating it with the flushing of toilets, he's creating a stark contrast between the expected romance and a mundane, even unappealing reality. this is typical of chandler's character, known for his sarcastic and cynical humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of ""magical night"" is completely undermined by the toilet flushing reference. the stark contrast between these two elements, combined with chandler's known tendency for sarcasm, strongly indicates that this statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the true intention is to make a joke by sarcastically describing an unromantic situation as magical.

### label: sarcastic

given this analysis, i'm confident that chandler's statement is indeed sarcastic.",1
"CHANDLER: Oh I see, I thought you just really really liked your new couch.","ROSS: Look I drew a sketch of how we are gonna do it ok? Rach, that's you, that's the couch
 RACHEL: What's that?
 ROSS: Oh, that's me.
 RACHEL: Wow! Certainly think a lot of yourself.
 ROSS: No, that's my arm.
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. chandler's statement ""oh i see"" suggests understanding, and ""i thought you just really really liked your new couch"" seems to express a positive assumption about someone's fondness for their couch.

step 2: true intention
however, considering this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor, and the emphasis on ""really really liked,"" it's likely that he's not being sincere. the exaggeration suggests he's actually implying the opposite - that the person doesn't like their couch at all, or that there's another reason for their behavior that has nothing to do with liking the couch.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention is to convey the opposite meaning through exaggeration and implied context. this mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

"MONICA: No its not big, not at all. Kind of the same lines as, I don't know, having a third nipple!","MONICA: You are dead meat
 CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be dismissive or minimizing. monica says ""no its not big, not at all"" which on the surface seems to downplay the significance of something.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the comparison to ""having a third nipple."" this is an unexpected and humorous exaggeration. having a third nipple is generally considered unusual and significant, contradicting the initial statement that whatever is being discussed is ""not big.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of minimizing the issue contrasts sharply with the exaggerated comparison. this mismatch between the stated sentiment and the absurd comparison is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. monica is using verbal irony to actually imply that the issue is indeed significant, contrary to her literal words.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this quote from chandler in the tv show ""friends"" is indeed sarcastic. chandler is known for his witty, sarcastic comments, and this line is a perfect example of his humor. he's making a joke about looking at genitals in the shower, and then sarcastically defends his right to make such a joke. the phrase ""oh please"" followed by his exaggerated claim of being ""allowed one joke in the monkey is penis genre"" is dripping with sarcasm. it's a classic example of chandler's self-deprecating and ironic humor.",1

 CHANDLER: Oh yeah sure, what do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, rafia, gingam , felt.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. chandler is making a statement about his testicles potentially being in an unspecified location, which is unusual and could be interpreted as concerning or uncomfortable.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor. the true intention here is to make a joke, probably in response to a situation where something of his is lost or misplaced. by exaggerating and mentioning his testicles, he's aiming for comedic effect through absurdity.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment doesn't immediately scream sarcasm, the true intention reveals that this is indeed a sarcastic comment. chandler is not literally suggesting his testicles are misplaced; he's using hyperbole and absurd humor to make light of a situation or to express frustration in a humorous way.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly meant to be humorous and is not to be taken literally, which are key elements of sarcasm in this context.",1
"JOEY: ThatÕs good, just keep rubbing your head. That will turn back time","PHOEBE: Oh so pretty, this must have cost him a fortune.

 RACHEL: What did you just say?
 CHANDLER: Crustal duck.
 RACHEL: No, no, no, the love part? Oh my god!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or encouraging. the phrase ""that's good"" and the suggestion to ""keep rubbing your head"" seem supportive at first glance. the statement ""that will turn back time"" also sounds like a positive outcome.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clear:
- rubbing one's head is not actually a method to turn back time.
- the suggestion is absurd and impossible.
- joey is likely mocking or making fun of someone's futile attempt to change something that has already happened.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface encouragement (step 1) is in stark contrast with the impossibility of the action and its intended result (step 2). this discrepancy is a classic indicator of sarcasm. joey is using a seemingly supportive statement to actually ridicule or criticize someone's actions or wishes.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using fake encouragement to point out the futility of an action.",1
CHANDLER: My duties?  All right.,"PERSON: You must've had your hands full
 CHANDLER: That I did. That I did.
 PERSON: So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear without more information:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. chandler is asking for clarification about his duties and saying ""all right,"" which could indicate willingness or acceptance.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine chandler's true intention. in friends, chandler often uses a sarcastic tone, but this line alone doesn't provide enough information to confidently say it's sarcastic. the ""all right"" could be genuinely agreeable or it could be said in a sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited context and the character's typical behavior in the show, there's a possibility this could be sarcastic, especially if delivered with a certain tone. however, the line itself doesn't contain clear markers of sarcasm.

given the uncertainty and lack of clear sarcastic indicators in this short line, i would err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification has low confidence due to the limited context provided. in a broader scene or with more information about chandler's tone or the situation, this could potentially be classified differently.",0
JOEY: Ok!,"RACHEL: You know? Forget it!
 JOEY: No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
 RACHEL: No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know
",FRIENDS,0,"in this case, i can output the result directly as i'm confident in my judgment:

### label: not sarcastic

the input ""joey: ok!"" is a simple, straightforward response that doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. it's a brief, neutral acknowledgment that doesn't seem to have any hidden meaning or ironic intent. the exclamation point might indicate enthusiasm or agreement, but it doesn't suggest sarcasm in this context.",0
CHANDLER: No way!,"MONICA: You wanna hear something that sucks.
 CHANDLER: Do I ever.
 MONICA: Chris says they're closing down the bar.
",FRIENDS,0,"since this is a very short exclamation without much context, i'll think through it step-by-step to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be surprise or disbelief, as indicated by the exclamation ""no way!""

step 2: without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. ""no way!"" can be used genuinely to express surprise, or it can be used sarcastically to express skepticism or mock someone's statement.

step 3: given the lack of context and the ambiguity of the phrase, it's not possible to definitively determine if this is sarcastic or not. the phrase ""no way!"" can be used both sincerely and sarcastically depending on the situation.

given this analysis, i don't have enough information to confidently classify this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. however, since we must choose a label, i'll default to the more literal interpretation:

### label: not sarcastic

note that this classification has low confidence due to the lack of context.",0
RACHEL: Oh.,"RACHEL: Hi! What are you doing here?
 ROSS: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
",FRIENDS,0,"given the extremely brief input ""rachel: oh."", there is not enough context or information to reliably determine if this is sarcastic or not. the expression ""oh"" can be used in many ways - sincere surprise, disappointment, realization, or sarcasm - depending on tone and context, which are not provided here.

therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the word ""oh"" by itself is neutral. it doesn't inherently convey positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, tone indicators, or body language cues, it's impossible to deduce the true intention behind this ""oh"". it could be a genuine reaction or a sarcastic one.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's not enough information to compare surface sentiment with true intention. the lack of context makes it impossible to reliably detect sarcasm.

given this analysis, i cannot confidently classify this statement as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. the safest classification would be:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification is made with very low confidence due to the lack of context. in real-world scenarios, more context would be necessary to make an accurate determination.",0

 CHANDLER: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
 JOEY: Which part exactly?
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: not sarcastic

i'll provide my reasoning for this classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""can we go?"" suggests some impatience or desire to leave a situation.

step 2: true intention
without more context, this seems to be a straightforward request to leave. chandler appears to be genuinely asking if they can depart from wherever they are. the ""the whole thing!"" at the beginning could be referring to something being complete or finished.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement seems direct and literal without any obvious irony or sarcasm. chandler appears to be simply expressing a desire to leave.

given the limited context and the straightforward nature of the statement, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. therefore, i classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this short line from chandler doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. the word ""great!"" followed by ""okay, here"" appears to be a straightforward, positive response. without additional context or chandler's typical sarcastic tone (which is common for his character in the show ""friends""), there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. the statement seems to be a genuine expression of enthusiasm or agreement, followed by an action or offering of something.",0
"PHOEBE: Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?","PHOEBE: Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look!
",FRIENDS,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly negative. phoebe is asking a question about whether something looks like a garbage can. there are no overtly positive or negative words, emojis, or sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention with certainty. however, the question itself suggests that phoebe might be implying that something (not specified in this snippet) does not look like a garbage can, or that someone has mistaken something for a garbage can when it clearly isn't one.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the potential true intention, there's a possibility of sarcasm here. phoebe might be sarcastically pointing out that something obviously doesn't look like a garbage can, implying that someone else has treated it as such or mistaken it for one.

however, without more context, it's challenging to be entirely certain about the sarcastic intent. the question could also be a genuine inquiry in some contexts.

given the limited information and the ambiguity, i don't have 90% confidence in my judgment. however, based on the typical use of such rhetorical questions in comedic contexts (and knowing this is a line from the character phoebe, likely from the tv show ""friends""), i would lean towards classifying this as sarcastic.

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or concern, without any discernible sarcastic elements. the character ross is likely reacting to an unexpected or shocking situation, as indicated by the exclamation ""oh my god"" and the follow-up question ""wh-what happened?"". the stuttering on ""what"" further emphasizes a genuine, spontaneous reaction of alarm or confusion. there are no contextual clues or linguistic markers that would suggest this is meant to be interpreted sarcastically.",0

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of fear or discomfort while watching something scary. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in rachel's words. the exclamation ""oh boy"" and the phrases ""i just can't watch"" and ""it's too scary"" are common, sincere expressions used when someone is genuinely frightened or uneasy about visual content. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement should be taken at face value as a non-sarcastic expression of fear.",0
ROSS: Yeah it would!,"JOEY: Uhh, the ball thing.
 ROSS: Yeah?
 JOEY: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
",FRIENDS,0,"to accurately classify this short statement as sarcastic or not sarcastic, i'll need to think through it step-by-step, as there's not enough context to make a confident judgment immediately.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. ""yeah"" is an affirmative word, and ""it would!"" sounds enthusiastic with the exclamation mark.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. the statement could genuinely be agreeing with something positively, or it could be sarcastically agreeing with something obviously untrue or undesirable.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the lack of context and the brevity of the statement, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory cues. the statement appears straightforward and sincere on its face.

### label: not sarcastic

while i can't be 100% certain without more context, based on the available information, this statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic agreement. the enthusiasm in the exclamation mark and the straightforward affirmative ""yeah"" suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm.",0

 ROSS: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
",FRIENDS,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or excited, as indicated by the exclamation ""really!?"" the use of both an exclamation mark and a question mark suggests heightened emotion or surprise.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention behind rachel's ""really!?"" it could genuinely express surprise or excitement, but it could also be expressing disbelief, skepticism, or sarcasm. the word ""really"" followed by ""!?"" is often used sarcastically to express doubt or disagreement.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the ambiguity and the common use of ""really!?"" in sarcastic contexts, there's a significant possibility that this could be sarcastic. however, without more context, it's impossible to be certain.

given the lack of context and the ambiguity of this short exclamation, i don't have 90% confidence in any judgment. however, based on the frequent use of ""really!?"" in sarcastic contexts, i'm leaning towards a sarcastic interpretation.

",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context of just ""monica: what? why?"", i don't have enough information to confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. this short phrase could be a genuine question in many scenarios without any sarcastic intent.

let's break it down step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. ""what?"" and ""why?"" are simple questions that don't inherently carry positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's impossible to determine if there's any hidden meaning or intention beyond literal questioning. monica could be genuinely confused, surprised, or seeking clarification.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't enough information to detect any discrepancy between surface meaning and true intention, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

given the lack of context and the neutral nature of the question, the most appropriate classification is:

### label: not sarcastic

however, it's important to note that this classification is made with low confidence due to the minimal context provided. in a larger conversation or with more context, this same phrase could potentially be part of a sarcastic exchange.",0
PHOEBE: Oh! Oop!,"JOEY: It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
 ROSS: Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
 CHANDLER: Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this short exclamation from phoebe doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. the ""oh! oop!"" seems to be a genuine, spontaneous reaction, likely to something surprising or a minor mistake. without more context, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. it appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic utterance.",0

 CHANDLER: Thanks man.
 JOEY: I gotta go check something over here.
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""what a baby"" typically expresses disapproval or criticism. on the surface, it appears to be a negative comment about someone behaving immaturely or being overly sensitive.

step 2: true intention
in many contexts, especially in casual or friendly conversation, ""what a baby"" is often used sarcastically. it's a common phrase used to tease someone lightheartedly rather than to seriously criticize them. the brevity and bluntness of the statement, particularly coming from a character like chandler (known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends""), strongly suggests a sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems negative, the likely true intention is to make a humorous, teasing comment rather than a genuine criticism. the disconnect between the literal meaning and the probable intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given chandler's character and the typical use of this phrase in casual settings, it's highly likely that this statement is meant sarcastically. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate.",1
JOEY: I talk to you and nothin'.,"JOEY: Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!
",FRIENDS,0,"i think i should analyze this step-by-step as the context is limited and sarcasm can be subtle:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. joey is stating a fact that when he talks to someone (presumably the person he's addressing), he gets ""nothin'"" in response. the use of ""nothin'"" instead of ""nothing"" gives it a casual, possibly frustrated tone.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a deeper meaning. however, joey seems to be expressing frustration or disappointment at the lack of response from the person he's talking to. the casual ""nothin'"" could indicate exasperation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a hint of frustration, there doesn't appear to be a clear mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention. the statement seems straightforward rather than ironic or sarcastic. joey appears to be genuinely commenting on a lack of communication.

based on this analysis, i don't see strong indicators of sarcasm in this isolated statement.

### label: not sarcastic",0
MONICA: Do you still wanna call  'em? I wanna call  'em.,"JOEY: Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward question and expression of desire from monica. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the character seems genuinely interested in making a phone call, likely referring to a previously discussed topic or situation. the repetition of ""wanna call 'em"" emphasizes her desire rather than implying any sarcastic undertone.",0

this sentence appears to be a straightforward statement without any evident sarcasm. rachel seems to be genuinely suggesting throwing something away, likely referring to a container or package she believes contains only shampoo or similar products. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the tone and content appear to be literal and sincere, fitting a normal conversational context.",0
"JOEY: So, you're just Bing?","CHANDLER: No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
 JOEY: It's not that bad.
 CHANDLER: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral. there are no obviously positive or negative keywords, no emotive phrases, and no emojis. it's a simple question asking for confirmation.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""just"" before ""bing"" could imply a dismissive or underwhelmed tone. ""so, you're just bing?"" might suggest that the speaker (joey) expected something more or different. this could be a subtle way of expressing disappointment or skepticism about the ai's capabilities or identity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying intention seems to carry a hint of sarcasm. the word ""just"" is key here, as it often implies limitation or inadequacy in colloquial use. joey might be sarcastically suggesting that being ""just bing"" is somehow less impressive or interesting than expected.

given this analysis, i'd lean towards classifying this as sarcastic, but with a relatively low confidence level as the sarcasm is quite subtle.

",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral. there are no overtly positive or negative words, no emojis, and no clear sentimental phrases. the phrase ""sensitive thing"" could potentially have a slightly negative connotation, but it's not definitive.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. the statement appears to be a straightforward comment about sensitivity, possibly referring to someone's personality trait or a situation. there are no clear rhetorical devices or unusual language styles that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the likely true intention, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the statement appears to be a simple observation or comment without any apparent irony or hidden meaning.

the surface sentiment appears negative. the use of ""throw me out of your office"" suggests anger or resentment. the question format also implies criticism or confrontation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disbelief. ross appears to be questioning why he should be grateful or appreciative (implied by ""for what?"") when he feels he's been treated poorly. the rhetorical question format emphasizes his incredulity at the situation.

step 3: comparison and final inference
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant mismatch or reversal of meaning that would indicate sarcasm. while the statement is confrontational and somewhat bitter, it seems to be a straightforward expression of ross's feelings about the situation. the question is rhetorical but not sarcastic.

MONICA: Like I have nothing better to do!,"MONICA: Richard!
 PERSON: Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
 MONICA: Ohh ..  Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be negative or annoyed. the phrase ""like i have nothing better to do!"" suggests that monica is irritated or frustrated.

step 2: upon closer analysis, this sentence is likely not meant to be taken literally. it's a common rhetorical device used to express the opposite of what is actually said. monica is implying that she does, in fact, have better things to do, and whatever she's being asked or expected to do is not a priority for her.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see a clear mismatch. monica is using verbal irony to express her displeasure or unwillingness to do something by sarcastically stating she has nothing better to do. this mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward introduction between people, without any apparent sarcastic elements. the speaker is simply introducing their sister krista to rachel. the tone and wording are neutral and appropriate for a casual introduction, lacking any indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.",0
"MONICA: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.","RACHEL: Uh-huh.
 PHOEBE: That sounds great!
 JOEY: Hey!
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement by monica doesn't contain sarcasm. it's a straightforward, albeit somewhat stern, declaration about a change in living arrangements and the consequences that come with it. monica is directly informing someone that they can no longer eat their food because the apartments have been switched. the phrase ""gravy train has ended"" is an idiom meaning that a period of easily obtained benefits has come to an end, but it's used literally here to emphasize the point, not sarcastically. the tone is assertive and perhaps a bit annoyed, but not sarcastic.",0

 CHANDLER: Yeah!
 PHOEBE: With what?
",FRIENDS,0,"label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

this statement by monica appears to be a straightforward complaint about the difficulty of finding a suitable wedding officiant. the sentiment expressed is one of frustration, but it's presented in a direct manner without any apparent irony or sarcasm.

monica is listing genuine issues they've encountered:
1. some officiants are boring
2. some are annoying
3. some inappropriately stare at women

these are presented as actual problems they're facing, not exaggerations or inversions of meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the colloquial tone (""y'know"") and the specific nature of the complaints suggest monica is speaking candidly about their experiences.

there's no indication that monica means the opposite of what she's saying or that she's using exaggeration for comic effect. therefore, this statement can be classified as not sarcastic.",0
MONICA: What?!?!,"MONICA: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
 PHOEBE: Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context of just ""monica: what?!?!"", it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether this is sarcastic or not. the expression could be genuinely surprised or it could be sarcastically exaggerated. let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be surprise or shock, as indicated by the use of multiple exclamation and question marks (""?!?!""). this punctuation suggests a strong emotional reaction.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's challenging to deduce the true intention. the name ""monica"" suggests this might be dialogue from a script or conversation. the exaggerated punctuation could be either genuine surprise or an over-the-top reaction that might indicate sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given only this short exclamation, there's not enough information to confidently determine if it's sarcastic. the exaggerated punctuation could lean slightly towards sarcasm, but it could just as easily be genuine shock or surprise.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" as the label, but with low confidence. without more context, it's safest to assume the exclamation is genuine rather than sarcastic. however, this classification could easily change with additional context.",0
"RACHEL: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!","RACHEL: I would love to live with you Ross.. that's-that's great! Thank you!

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i can provide this label with high confidence without needing to break it down step-by-step. the statement from rachel appears to be a genuine expression of gratitude or excitement towards ross. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm in this short, straightforward exclamation. the use of ross's name twice and the exclamation mark emphasize rachel's sincere enthusiasm about whatever ross has done or said. this kind of effusive, direct expression is typical in sitcom dialogue (which this appears to be from) when characters are genuinely happy or grateful, not when they're being sarcastic.",0
CHANDLER: What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?,"CHANDLER: One ticket to Yemen? Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
 PERSON: I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't immediately clear to me:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment seems neutral. it's a straightforward question about what one might give to a child who wants a ticket to play with. there are no obvious sentimental keywords or phrases.

step 2: true intention:
this question seems odd or nonsensical. tickets are generally not something children ""play with."" this could be a setup for a joke or a sarcastic comment, especially given that it's attributed to chandler, a character from the tv show ""friends"" known for his sarcastic humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the oddity of the question and its attribution to chandler suggest there might be more to it. however, without more context, it's difficult to definitively label this as sarcastic. the question alone doesn't provide enough information to confidently determine sarcasm.

given the limited context and the ambiguity, i can't confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. however, considering chandler's character and the unusual nature of the question, there's a slight lean towards potential sarcasm.

"JOEY: Oh sure, go with the sissy.","PHOEBE: Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
 CHANDLER: Well sensitive is important, pick him.
 PHOEBE: Yeah.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or dismissive. the use of ""oh sure"" often indicates sarcasm or dismissiveness. the word ""sissy"" is typically used as an insult or derogatory term, suggesting a negative attitude.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention with absolute certainty. however, the phrase ""oh sure"" is often used sarcastically to express disagreement or mockery. the use of ""sissy"" as an insult further suggests that joey is not sincerely encouraging someone to ""go with the sissy"" but rather mocking or criticizing this choice.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there's a mismatch. while on the surface it might seem like joey is agreeing (""oh sure""), the use of sarcastic phrasing and the insulting term ""sissy"" indicate that he's actually expressing disapproval or mockery. this mismatch between the literal words and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis strongly suggests that joey's statement is sarcastic. the combination of the dismissive ""oh sure"" with the derogatory term ""sissy"" creates a sarcastic tone, where joey is likely mocking or criticizing someone's choice rather than genuinely endorsing it.",1

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement from ross doesn't contain any sarcastic elements. it appears to be a straightforward, albeit somewhat awkward, expression of his thoughts. the stammering (""i-i-i"") suggests sincerity and perhaps nervousness, rather than sarcasm. the context implies he's talking about initiating something (possibly a romantic interaction) and expressing that he would have done so if the other person hadn't. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0
ROSS: DANGER,"RACHEL: I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over
 PHOEBE: No Rachel! They got here first! Why is Ross doing that?
",FRIENDS,0,"given the very limited context provided in the input ""ross: danger"", i don't have enough information to confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the statement is too brief and lacks context to determine if there's any sarcastic intent.

to make a more informed decision, i'll think through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of alarm or warning, indicated by the word ""danger"" in all caps.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's impossible to determine if there's a hidden meaning or sarcastic intent. this could be a genuine warning of danger, or it could potentially be an exaggerated statement meant sarcastically.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of additional context or clues, there's not enough information to confidently determine if this is sarcastic or not. the statement could be taken at face value as a genuine warning, or it could be an overreaction to something minor meant sarcastically.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" as the label, but with very low confidence. without more context, it's safest to assume the statement is meant literally rather than sarcastically. however, this classification could easily change with additional information or context.",0
JOEY: Yeah! Look!,"RACHEL: Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
 JOEY: Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
 RACHEL: Really?
",FRIENDS,0,"for this short input ""joey: yeah! look!"", i don't have enough context or information to confidently determine if it's sarcastic or not. the exclamation marks could indicate enthusiasm, but without more context, it's impossible to tell if it's genuine or sarcastic. therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and excited, as indicated by the exclamation marks and the enthusiastic ""yeah!""

step 2: without additional context, it's difficult to deduce the true intention. this could be genuine excitement or could be sarcastic depending on the situation joey is responding to.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's not enough information to confidently determine if this is sarcastic. the surface sentiment seems positive, but sarcasm often mimics positive sentiment. without knowing what joey is responding to or his tone, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment.

given the lack of context and the brevity of the statement, i cannot confidently classify this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic.

### label: not enough information to determine",0
JOEY: You'd better act surprised.,"MONICA: About what?
 JOEY: He's planning your birthday party.
 MONICA: Oh my God! I love him!
",FRIENDS,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""you'd better"" could be seen as advice or a friendly suggestion. there are no overtly sentimental words or phrases, and no emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is likely a warning or instruction. ""you'd better"" is often used to give a strong suggestion or mild threat. in this context, joey is likely telling someone to pretend to be surprised about something, implying that the surprise is actually expected or planned.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the underlying intention suggests a discrepancy between what should be shown (surprise) and what is actually known (expectation of an event). this mismatch between expected reaction and reality is a common element in sarcastic statements.

however, this statement alone doesn't provide enough context to definitively label it as sarcastic. it could be a genuine instruction in a situation where someone needs to act surprised for a planned event (like a surprise party).

given the limited context and the ambiguity, i don't have 90% confidence in a sarcasm classification. however, based on the typical use of such phrases in conversational contexts, i would lean towards:

### label: not sarcastic

this statement seems more likely to be a straightforward instruction rather than a sarcastic comment, but it's a close call without more context.",0

 CHANDLER: I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not that close. I haven't seen him in years.
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. monica seems to be genuinely concerned or upset about a situation where someone wasn't asked about something, and she's questioning what will happen when that person finds out. the tone appears to be one of genuine worry or frustration, rather than sarcasm.

the exclamation and question marks indicate emotional intensity, but they don't suggest sarcasm in this context. instead, they reinforce the sense of genuine concern or agitation in monica's voice.

without more context, it's difficult to detect any irony or hidden meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of worry about a potentially uncomfortable or problematic situation.",0
"RACHEL: Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.","PHOEBE: No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
 RACHEL: I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
 PHOEBE: Not after this!
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or reassuring. rachel is telling others to ""relax"" and uses an elongated ""doooo"" which could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the context is limited, but the elongated ""doooo"" could be interpreted in different ways:
1. it might be genuine enthusiasm or reassurance.
2. it could be exaggerated or mocking, potentially implying the opposite of relaxation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
without more context, it's difficult to definitively determine if this is sarcastic. the elongated ""doooo"" is the main element that could potentially indicate sarcasm, but it's not conclusive. given the limited information and the ambiguity, i'm inclined to interpret this as not sarcastic, but with low confidence.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification has low confidence due to the limited context and the potential for multiple interpretations of the dialogue.",0
"RACHEL: Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?","RACHEL: Y'know what, actually ..   Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
 PERSON: I thought you didn't smoke.
 RACHEL: Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
",FRIENDS,0,"to properly classify this statement, i'll need to think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. the speaker, rachel, is using casual language to ask a question or seek confirmation about understanding. there are no clearly positive or negative keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be genuine curiosity or seeking clarification. the use of ""y'know what i mean"" is a common phrase used to check if the listener understands or relates to what's being said. the term ""dubbies"" is likely slang, but without more context, it's hard to determine its exact meaning or any potential hidden connotations.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the statement seems to be a straightforward, casual question or attempt to relate to the listener. there are no obvious rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would suggest sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic attempt at communication or seeking understanding.",0

 CHANDLER: I've got canned goods.
 JOEY: Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the word ""excellent"" is used, which typically conveys praise or approval. chandler is seemingly complimenting joe on a ""hole,"" which in context could be related to a game or task.

step 2: however, knowing that this is dialogue from the tv show ""friends,"" and considering chandler's character, who is known for his sarcastic humor, we need to look deeper. the phrase ""excellent hole, joe"" is unusually brief and specific, which can be a sign of sarcasm, especially when praising something mundane or potentially negative.

step 3: comparing the surface positive sentiment with the likely intention, and considering chandler's character, this statement is most likely sarcastic. chandler is probably pointing out a mistake joe made, or mocking something joe did, rather than genuinely praising him.

 RACHEL: Said what? Exactly.
 PERSON: That you enjoyed the occasional drink .. ing binge.
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, but i'll explain my reasoning:

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of anger and frustration rather than sarcasm. the exclamations, repetition, and strong language (""oh my god!!"", ""that is it!"", ""i'm leaving!"") indicate real emotional distress. the direct accusation ""you are just a horrible person!"" further reinforces that this is likely a sincere outburst rather than a sarcastic comment.

in this context, rachel seems to be genuinely upset and expressing her feelings openly, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the straightforward nature of the statement and the emotional intensity point to a literal interpretation rather than a sarcastic one.",0
"RACHEL: Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?","JOEY: Oh my!

this simple ""thank you"" from monica appears to be a straightforward expression of gratitude without any indicators of sarcasm. there's no context provided that would suggest a sarcastic intent, and ""thank you"" is typically used sincerely in most situations. without any additional cues or context that might imply sarcasm (such as an exaggerated tone, contradictory situation, or ironic context), it's reasonable to interpret this as a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of thanks.",0

this statement appears to be a straightforward, factual declaration about someone's educational experience. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the sentence is simple, direct, and lacks any contradictory elements or exaggerated language that might suggest sarcastic intent. it's a neutral statement about studying abroad, which is a common and believable experience for many students.",0

this short statement from rachel doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. it's a straightforward request for information or instructions, expressed plainly and directly. there's no contrast between surface sentiment and true intention, no exaggeration, irony, or other rhetorical devices typically associated with sarcastic remarks. the brevity and simplicity of the statement further support a literal interpretation.",0
"PHOEBE: I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.","PHOEBE: Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
 MONICA: Very good,  so good.
",FRIENDS,1,"since the confidence in my judgment for this input is less than 90%, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the keywords ""really, really enjoyed"" and ""very exotic"" indicate strong enthusiasm and appreciation.

step 2: without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. the repetition of ""really"" could potentially be interpreted as overemphasis, which might hint at sarcasm, but it could also be genuine excitement. ""very exotic"" is ambiguous - it could be sincere praise or a veiled criticism, depending on the context and tone.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's not enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the statement could be entirely sincere, especially if phoebe is known for being enthusiastic or if she's describing something genuinely new and exciting to her.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the straightforward positive sentiment, i'll err on the side of taking the statement at face value.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and with more information about the situation, speaker's tone, or preceding conversation, this interpretation could change.",0
"JOEY: When? Today? Some, not a lot.","CHANDLER: Joe?
 JOEY: Yeah!
 CHANDLER: Uh, you've had a lot of sex right?

step 2: without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm in this statement. joey seems to be directly answering a question about something happening today, indicating that there will be some of it, but not much. the brevity and casual tone of the response don't strongly suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. the statement seems straightforward and literal rather than sarcastic.

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement from ross appears to be a straightforward expression of his preferences and frustrations, without any apparent sarcasm. he's directly stating his discomfort with having strangers in his apartment when he wants to relax. the mention of ""puzzle"" and ""cold beer"" emphasizes his desire for a peaceful, private environment. there's no discrepancy between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0
ROSS: We- we had our first fight this morning.,"MONICA: Do you always have to bring him here?
 ROSS: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright?
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

this statement from ross appears to be a straightforward declaration about an event that occurred - having a first fight with someone (likely a romantic partner). there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the context of sharing this information with friends (as it seems to be from a conversation) also suggests it's meant to be taken at face value.

in sitcom contexts like friends where this quote likely comes from, characters often share relationship milestones or issues with their friends in a genuine manner. a ""first fight"" is typically seen as a notable event in a new relationship, so ross mentioning it directly aligns with normal conversational patterns.

without additional context or tone indicators that might suggest otherwise, this statement appears to be a literal, non-sarcastic comment about a relationship development.",0

 PERSON: Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
 JOEY: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
",FRIENDS,0,"to accurately classify this statement, i'll analyze it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward, factual statement. the phrase ""nobody sees the king!"" suggests exclusivity or isolation of the king figure. there are no obvious emotional keywords or sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
this statement likely refers to the idiom ""the emperor has no clothes"" from hans christian andersen's tale. in this context, it's usually used to point out that people are afraid or unwilling to criticize someone in a position of power, even when that person is clearly wrong or foolish.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface meaning (step 1) implies that the king is unseen or inaccessible. however, the true intention (step 2) is to criticize people's reluctance to speak truth to power. this significant discrepancy between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement ""nobody sees the king!"" is indeed sarcastic. it uses irony to comment on people's behavior around authority figures, implying that people pretend not to see the king's faults or mistakes, rather than literally not seeing the king.",1
PERSON: Yeah.,"ROSS: I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.

 ROSS: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
",FRIENDS,0,"given the extremely brief input of just ""yeah."", there is not enough context or information to confidently determine if this is sarcastic or not. the word ""yeah"" on its own can be used both sincerely and sarcastically depending on tone, context, and delivery. without more details, i don't have 90% confidence in making a judgment.

therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of ""yeah."" is neutral to slightly positive. it's an affirmative word typically used to agree or confirm something.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, tone indicators, or body language cues, it's impossible to deduce a hidden meaning or true intention beyond the surface-level affirmation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
since we can't determine any discrepancy between the surface sentiment and true intention due to lack of context, we have to default to taking the statement at face value.

based on this analysis, the most appropriate label would be:

### label: not sarcastic

however, it's important to note that this classification is made with low confidence due to the extremely limited input. in real-world scenarios, sarcasm detection often requires more context, including the surrounding conversation, tone of voice, or additional textual cues.",0

 CHANDLER: Exactly.
 ROSS: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this line from chandler (presumably from the tv show ""friends"") is a straightforward admission that he made up a game. there's no discrepancy between the surface meaning and the intended meaning. chandler is being direct and honest, admitting that something isn't real and that he invented it.

the exclamation marks indicate emphasis and perhaps frustration or exasperation, but they don't suggest sarcasm. chandler is likely responding to someone who thought the game was real, and he's emphatically clarifying that it's not.

in the context of chandler's character, while he often uses sarcasm, this particular statement doesn't fit the pattern of his typical sarcastic remarks. it's a simple, factual statement without any ironic or contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm.

therefore, this statement is classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0

this statement appears to be a direct, enthusiastic encouragement rather than sarcasm. the character phoebe is using blunt language to persuade someone to join them in watching dancers, likely in the context of a comedy or sitcom (possibly from the tv show ""friends""). while the language is somewhat exaggerated and playful, it doesn't contain the hallmarks of sarcasm such as irony or saying the opposite of what's meant. the speaker seems genuinely trying to convince someone to come along and have fun, albeit in a forceful and comedic way.",0
"PERSON: Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given'  'em out.","MONICA: You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
 RACHEL: Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
 MONICA: Pete, can I get you something else?
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm here isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the person is casually requesting a slice of cheesecake and a date, if they're being offered. there are no overtly negative or positive keywords or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a casual, somewhat humorous request. the phrasing ""if you're given' 'em out"" suggests a lighthearted, informal tone. it implies that dates aren't typically given out freely, adding a touch of humor to the request.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a slight discrepancy between the casual request for cheesecake and the more unusual request for a date ""if you're given' 'em out,"" this doesn't appear to rise to the level of sarcasm. the humor is gentle and straightforward rather than biting or ironic.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine, albeit humorous, request rather than a sarcastic comment. the slight joke about getting a date doesn't subvert the overall meaning or intent of the statement in a way that would indicate sarcasm.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration or displeasure without any evident sarcasm. the character ross is directly stating that something is ""not funny,"" which seems to be a genuine sentiment rather than a sarcastic remark. there are no contextual clues or linguistic indicators that suggest this statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically. the exclamation point emphasizes the seriousness of the statement, reinforcing that it's likely a sincere expression of disapproval or annoyance.",0
"JOEY: Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Morning's here! Morning is here,","PERSON: HEY!! Do you Oh come on! Morning's here!  Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here! I
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""i love that guy!""
- exclamation marks indicating enthusiasm
- repetition of ""morning's here!"" which seems cheerful

step 2: true intention
analyzing the context and language:
- the phrase ""are you kidding?"" at the beginning suggests potential sarcasm or disbelief
- the repetition of ""morning is here"" could be mimicking an annoying wake-up call or song
- joey (likely referring to the friends character) is known for his sarcastic humor

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the opening phrase and context suggest that joey might actually be annoyed by the morning or the person he's referring to. the exaggerated enthusiasm could be a sarcastic way of expressing frustration with early mornings or an overly cheerful person.

given this analysis, i believe there's a strong possibility of sarcasm here.

 MONICA: Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
",FRIENDS,1,"label: not sarcastic

this statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. phoebe is genuinely expressing gratitude and seeking reassurance. the phrase ""stating the obvious"" is a common preface to acknowledge when someone is saying something that might not need to be said, but it's not being used sarcastically here. the follow-up question ""and it's not weird is it"" indicates genuine concern or desire for confirmation, which is inconsistent with sarcasm. the overall tone seems straightforward and sincere rather than ironic or mocking.",0

 JOEY: Great.  You got anything that's not
",FRIENDS,0,"to properly classify this statement, i'll need to think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or dismissive. ""yeah, i don't think so"" is a phrase typically used to disagree with or reject something.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm here. rachel could genuinely be disagreeing with joe about something. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain obvious rhetorical devices or unusual language that might indicate sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface meaning and the likely true intention. the statement appears to be a genuine expression of disagreement or doubt.

given this analysis, i would classify this statement as:

### label: not sarcastic

while sarcasm can be subtle, this statement doesn't provide enough contextual clues or linguistic markers to suggest it's anything other than a straightforward expression of disagreement.",0
"RACHEL: Yeah, I'm fine.","PERSON: Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
 RACHEL: Yeah. Well, umm.....
 PERSON: Rach, are you okay?
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the context is limited and sarcasm can be subtle:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. ""yeah, i'm fine"" is a common phrase indicating that someone is okay or doing well.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. however, in many situations, especially in dramatic or emotional contexts, saying ""i'm fine"" can actually mean the opposite. the brevity of the response and the fact that it's attributed to a specific character (rachel) suggests this might be part of a larger dialogue where the true meaning could differ from the surface sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited context, we can't definitively say this is sarcastic. however, ""i'm fine"" is often used sarcastically in situations where someone is clearly not fine but doesn't want to discuss their feelings or doesn't want to burden others. the brevity of the response could also indicate some tension or reluctance to elaborate, which might hint at sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's potential for this to be sarcastic depending on the broader context, without more information, we can't confidently label it as sarcastic. the safest classification based on the given information is ""not sarcastic,"" as we should avoid assuming sarcasm without clear indicators.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this sentence appears to be a straightforward description of an object, likely in response to a question about what something looks like or what features it has. there are no indicators of sarcasm or hidden meaning. joey is simply describing a physical item, presumably some kind of accessory for a stroller, in a direct and literal manner.",0
"ROSS: So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller.","ROSS: Whoa Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward introduction without any obvious sarcastic elements. ross is simply stating his role as professor geller, likely in an academic or educational context. there are no contradictory cues, exaggerated tone, or ironic undertones that would suggest sarcasm. the statement is direct and informative, consistent with someone introducing themselves in a professional capacity.",0

 RACHEL: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
 PHOEBE: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
",FRIENDS,0,"to accurately classify this statement, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. joey is making a statement that seems matter-of-fact, without obvious positive or negative emotional indicators.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. the statement could be taken literally - that hungry people will eventually come in for food. however, it could also be interpreted as callous or dismissive, depending on the situation.

step 3: analysis and inference
given the limited context and the absence of clear sarcastic indicators (like exaggeration, irony, or contrasting elements), it's most likely that this statement is meant to be taken at face value.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a possibility of sarcasm depending on the broader context, based solely on the given text, the statement appears to be a straightforward observation rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
"MONICA: Well, don't  'cha wanna?","PHOEBE: It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.

 PHOEBE: You think you know me so well.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear without more information:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""don't 'cha wanna?"" is casual and playful, potentially indicating enthusiasm or encouragement.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning. monica's tone could be genuinely enthusiastic, or it could potentially be mocking or sarcastic depending on the situation and her relationship with the person she's speaking to.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the limited information, there's not enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the phrasing appears to be a straightforward, colloquial question without clear indicators of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

"CHANDLER: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio","JOEY: That's the rule.
 CHANDLER: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
 JOEY: How'd you get to that?
",FRIENDS,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""the piece of furniture was fine until..."" suggests something happened to change its state. the use of ""little breakfast adventure"" could be interpreted as minimizing or downplaying an event.

step 2: true intention
chandler's true intention appears to be making a subtle accusation or criticism. the phrase ""little breakfast adventure"" is likely an understatement for what was probably a more significant incident involving angela delvecchio that damaged the furniture. this understatement, combined with the specific mention of the person involved, suggests chandler is being indirectly critical or accusatory.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively mild, the underlying intention seems to be conveying criticism or blame through understatement and indirect language. this mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the use of understatement (""little breakfast adventure"") to refer to what was likely a more significant incident damaging the furniture, combined with the subtle accusatory tone, strongly indicates sarcasm in chandler's statement.",1
RACHEL: What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?,"ROSS: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be one of confusion or disbelief. rachel's stuttering ""what-wh-what"" indicates surprise or shock. the question about staying married forever seems to express concern or uncertainty about a long-term commitment.

step 2: analyzing the true intention, this statement is likely rhetorical rather than a genuine question. the exaggerated nature of ""stay married forever"" suggests that rachel doesn't actually believe this is a realistic or desirable option. the tone implies frustration or sarcasm about the current situation.

step 3: comparing the surface confusion with the underlying frustration and the use of hyperbole (""forever""), this statement appears to be sarcastic. rachel is not sincerely asking about staying married forever, but rather using this exaggerated question to express her dissatisfaction or incredulity about the current state of affairs.

this statement doesn't appear to contain any sarcasm. ross is simply expressing uncertainty about what constitutes ""something girlie."" the phrase is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically indicate sarcasm. the casual tone and context (assuming this is from the tv show friends) suggest it's likely a genuine, if somewhat stereotypical, comment rather than a sarcastic one.",0

 ROSS: All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
 PERSON: What is going on?
",FRIENDS,0,"to properly analyze this input, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be confusion and possibly frustration or anger. the repeated exclamation marks and the repetition of ""what's going on"" suggest heightened emotions.

step 2: true intention
in this context, ross seems to be responding to something that's happening, but his response is peculiar. he's answering his own question immediately, using the same phrase. this doesn't actually provide any new information or clarification.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows confusion and emotion, but the true intention seems to be to make a humorous or absurd statement. by repeating the phrase, ross is essentially saying nothing while appearing to answer his own question. this creates a circular, nonsensical response that's likely meant to be funny rather than genuinely informative.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is intended to be humorous through its circular logic and absurdity, which is a form of sarcasm.

JOEY: Weā€™re not peeking?,"PERSON: Come on!
",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context and brevity of the input text, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly inquisitive. joey is asking a question about not peeking, which doesn't inherently convey any strong positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm in this statement. the question ""we're not peeking?"" could be a genuine inquiry, or it could potentially be rhetorical depending on the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators (no exaggeration, no obvious contradiction between surface meaning and intent, no ironic tone markers), and without additional context, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a straightforward question.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's always a possibility of sarcasm in any statement depending on context and delivery, based solely on the given text, there isn't enough evidence to classify this as sarcastic. the statement appears to be a simple question without clear sarcastic markers.",0

 CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no.
 JOEY: A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
",FRIENDS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure a reliable classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or nonchalant. chandler is stating his age (29) and implying that he doesn't need a savings account, which on the surface might seem like a carefree or confident attitude about finances.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention is likely the opposite. at 29, most people would consider it important to have a savings account for future financial security. chandler's statement goes against common financial wisdom, which suggests he's not actually promoting this idea but rather mocking it or himself.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disparity between the surface sentiment (not needing savings at 29) and the generally accepted truth (it's important to save money, especially when young) strongly indicates sarcasm. chandler is likely using this statement to self-deprecate or comment on his own financial irresponsibility in a humorous way.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as:

### label: sarcastic",1

 PHOEBE: Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
 CHANDLER: I like her.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of admiration or praise. the question ""why?"" followed by listing positive abilities (""she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time"") suggests appreciation of someone's talents.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and tone suggest this might not be sincere praise. the use of ""because"" followed by an exaggerated list of talents, especially with the emphasis on doing ""both at the same time,"" hints at a mocking or dismissive attitude. the speaker (phoebe) seems to be implying that these talents are not as impressive as someone else might think.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface praise with the likely dismissive intention reveals a discrepancy that is characteristic of sarcasm. the exaggerated tone and the implication that these talents are not actually impressive contradict the surface-level admiration.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the surface sentiment appears positive, the underlying intention is likely mocking or dismissive, which is a classic indicator of sarcasm.",1
ROSS: Thank you.,"ROSS: I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache.

this short phrase ""thank you"" spoken by ross appears to be a straightforward expression of gratitude. there are no contextual clues or additional information provided that would suggest any sarcastic intent. in its basic form, ""thank you"" is typically used sincerely to express appreciation, and without any contradictory tone or context, it's reasonable to interpret this as a genuine, non-sarcastic statement.",0

this statement appears to be a straightforward instruction or command from monica, likely in a situation where someone is not appropriately dressed or covered. there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm in this short, direct statement. the imperative tone suggests a genuine concern or desire for the person to cover themselves up, rather than any ironic or mocking intent that would be characteristic of sarcasm.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"to analyze this input for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or disbelief. rachel's use of ""wait, wait"" and the questioning tone suggest she's taken aback by what chandler is having for thanksgiving dinner.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind rachel's question seems to be genuine curiosity or possibly concern. there's no clear indication of sarcasm in her tone or wording. it appears to be a straightforward question about chandler's thanksgiving dinner plans.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. rachel's question appears to be a genuine inquiry without any hidden meaning or irony.

this line from ross doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward statement and question, likely part of a normal conversation. there are no contradictory elements, exaggerated language, or contextual clues that would suggest sarcastic intent. the tone seems neutral and literal, so i'm confident in classifying this as not sarcastic.",0

this statement appears to be a direct, emphatic assertion without any underlying sarcastic tone. the use of exclamation marks indicates strong emotion or emphasis, but there's no evidence of irony or sarcasm. monica seems to be genuinely asserting that someone did not have a relationship, likely in response to a previous claim or discussion. the straightforward nature of the statement and lack of any contradictory elements or subtle wordplay suggests it is meant to be taken at face value.",0

this statement from ross doesn't appear to contain any sarcastic elements. it seems to be a straightforward assertion about his emotional state and how he doesn't always need to be okay. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the repetition of ""okay"" emphasizes his point rather than introducing irony. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as not sarcastic.",0
MONICA: Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!,"PHOEBE: You guys make a
 JOEY: Yeah, we look great together.
 CHANDLER: Okay.
",FRIENDS,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and excited. the use of ""wow!"" and the exclamation marks indicate enthusiasm. the phrase ""imagine what our kids would look like!"" suggests a positive anticipation or daydreaming about a future together.

step 2: without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or sarcastic intent. in a genuine romantic context, this could be a sincere expression of excitement about a potential future. however, in a different context (e.g., if monica is speaking to someone she dislikes or if this is said after a negative interaction), it could be sarcastic.

step 3: given the limited context and the ambiguity of the situation, it's challenging to definitively label this as sarcastic. the surface-level enthusiasm could be genuine, especially if this is from a romantic comedy or a scene where two characters are getting along well.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" because, without additional context that would suggest otherwise, the statement appears to be a genuine expression of excitement about a potential romantic future. however, i acknowledge that with more context, this interpretation could change.",0
"JOEY: I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.","PERSON: Hi Joey.
 JOEY: Hey! How you doin'?
 PERSON: He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
",FRIENDS,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""i'd love to show ya"" expresses enthusiasm and willingness to help or demonstrate something.

step 2: however, the second part of the sentence, ""but i just tucked her in,"" suggests that joey is referring to a person (likely a child) who has been put to bed. this creates an incongruity with the first part, as it's not typical to ""show"" a sleeping person.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's a mismatch between the initial enthusiasm and the impossibility of the action. this suggests that joey is likely using humor or mild sarcasm to decline a request or avoid showing something. the sarcasm is subtle and playful rather than biting or obvious.

given this analysis, i'm leaning towards classifying this as mildly sarcastic, but it's a close call. to err on the side of caution:

this statement by ross appears to be a straightforward, sincere expression of his feelings about not wanting to go away together yet. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the tone or wording. the phrase ""i'm sorry"" suggests he's genuinely trying to express his opinion gently, and the rest of the sentence is a clear, direct statement of his thoughts on the matter. therefore, this can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0

",FRIENDS,1,"to analyze this properly, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or curious. chandler is asking a question about protecting something from a tornado, which on the surface could be seen as a genuine inquiry about an act of protection or heroism.

step 2: true intention
in the context of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" and his typical speech patterns, this is likely not a genuine question. chandler is known for his sarcastic remarks and witty comebacks. the exaggerated nature of the question (protecting from a tornado) suggests that he's not actually asking about tornado protection, but rather making a mocking or sarcastic comment about someone's claim of protection.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of a curious question contrasts with the likely true intention of mocking or belittling someone's claim. this discrepancy between the apparent meaning and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the question ""and protected them from a tornado?"" is almost certainly meant to be sarcastic, especially coming from chandler. it's likely a response to someone making an exaggerated or unrealistic claim about protection, and chandler is using this hyperbolic example to point out the absurdity of the original claim.",1

"PHOEBE: See, there you go, the cleansing works!","MONICA: So, um, will you bring the truck?
 PERSON: I'll even let you ring the bell.
 RACHEL: Oh, my god.
",FRIENDS,0,"to determine if this statement is sarcastic or not, i'll need to consider the context and potential implications. without more context, i don't have 90% confidence, so i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""there you go"" is encouraging, and ""the cleansing works!"" sounds like an enthusiastic endorsement of some process or treatment.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. however, the name ""phoebe"" suggests this might be dialogue from a tv show or movie. in such contexts, seemingly positive statements can sometimes mask sarcasm or irony, especially if the ""cleansing"" refers to something unusual or ineffective.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the limited information, we can't conclusively determine if this is sarcastic. it could be a genuine statement of approval if the cleansing process actually worked. however, if the cleansing was ineffective or absurd in some way, this could be a sarcastic comment.

due to the lack of context and the potential for this to be either genuine or sarcastic depending on the situation, i don't have enough information to confidently classify this statement.

 JOEY: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture,I didn't have my camera!
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward statement about jogging. chandler is saying that chasing a churo vendor isn't actually jogging.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is to mock or ridicule someone (likely another character) who has claimed that chasing a churo vendor counts as jogging. chandler is using a dry, deadpan delivery to point out the absurdity of this claim.

step 3: analysis and final label
the sarcasm comes from the contrast between the seemingly serious tone of the statement and the absurdity of the situation it describes. chandler is not genuinely trying to define jogging; he's using irony to humorously criticize someone's attempt to pass off chasing a food vendor as exercise.

the phrase ""first of all"" implies that this is part of a longer list of criticisms or points, which adds to the sarcastic tone. it suggests that the speaker finds multiple issues with the other person's claim, starting with this particularly ridiculous one.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using verbal irony to make a humorous point, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1
"PERSON: Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know how that happened.","PERSON: I remember when we first got engaged.
 CHANDLER: Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly confused. the speaker states a fact (getting judy pregnant) followed by an expression of uncertainty (""i still don't know how that happened.""). there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emotional phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be conveying genuine confusion or feigned ignorance. the statement ""i still don't know how that happened"" regarding pregnancy is likely not meant to be taken literally, as the basic biological process of conception is generally well-known. this suggests the speaker is either:
a) expressing shock or disbelief at an unexpected pregnancy
b) pretending not to understand how pregnancies occur, possibly to deflect responsibility

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the implied meaning suggests a discrepancy between what's said and what's meant. the feigned ignorance about the cause of pregnancy is likely meant to be humorous or to express surprise rather than literal confusion. this discrepancy between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is intended to be sarcastic.

PHOEBE: Was it not pain-free?,"MONICA: Did that!
 PHOEBE: Grasp one of the linen strips by its  'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
 MONICA: Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly negative. the question ""was it not pain-free?"" suggests an inquiry about whether something was painful or not. the use of ""not pain-free"" instead of simply ""painful"" adds a layer of complexity to the sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this question is not immediately clear without more context. however, the phrasing ""not pain-free"" instead of ""painful"" could be a subtle way of implying that something was indeed painful while seeming to ask a neutral question. this indirect way of asking could potentially be used sarcastically.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the potential true intention, there's a possibility of sarcasm. the indirect phrasing could be a way of sarcastically understating a painful experience. however, without more context about the situation or the speaker's tone, it's difficult to be certain.

given the limited context and the ambiguity in the phrasing, i can't confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the statement could be a genuine inquiry or a sarcastic comment depending on the broader context and the speaker's tone.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" as the final label because, without clear evidence of sarcasm and considering the principle of assuming literal meaning in absence of strong contrary indicators, it's safer to interpret this as a straightforward question. however, i acknowledge that this classification has a lower confidence level due to the potential for sarcasm that can't be definitively ruled out without more context.",0

this statement by phoebe appears to be a straightforward observation or opinion about human behavior, without any apparent sarcastic intent. the sentence is making a simple claim about how people typically respond when their name is called repeatedly. there's no evident contrast between a surface meaning and a hidden intention that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than mocking or ironic, which are common indicators of sarcasm. therefore, i believe this statement is not sarcastic.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of this quote is neutral. it's a simple statement about someone (joey) mispronouncing a word. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this quote appears to be humorous rather than sarcastic. it's likely a line from a sitcom or comedy show where joey (possibly from the tv show ""friends"") is struggling to pronounce ""butternut squash"" correctly. the humor comes from the mispronounciation itself, not from any sarcastic intent.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface sentiment (neutral) with the true intention (humorous), there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the quote is meant to be funny because of the mispronunciation, but it's not using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.

this statement by chandler appears to be a genuine expression of sympathy and surprise upon learning about a friend's divorce. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this context. the sentiment expressed aligns with the typical response one would give upon hearing such news, showing concern and offering condolences. the language is straightforward and doesn't contain any ironic or contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm.",0

this line from monica in the tv show ""friends"" is a straightforward request for a borrowed item. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meaning in this statement. monica is simply asking for the return of a broiling pan that joey had borrowed earlier. the language is direct and literal, without any sarcastic undertones or contradictions between surface meaning and true intention.",0

this sentence appears to be a straightforward, enthusiastic invitation to attend a game. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the exclamation ""me too!"" shows genuine excitement, and the follow-up question about attending the game on tuesday is a sincere invitation. the tone and content align naturally without any contradictions or ironic elements that would suggest sarcasm.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context and brevity of the input ""phoebe: uh-huh!"", i don't have enough confidence to make a direct judgment about whether this is sarcastic or not. let's analyze it step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of ""uh-huh!"" is generally neutral to positive. it's typically used as an affirmative response, showing agreement or acknowledgment.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention behind this utterance. ""uh-huh"" can be used sincerely to show agreement, or it can be used sarcastically to express disbelief, skepticism, or mock agreement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the ambiguous nature of ""uh-huh,"" we cannot confidently determine if this is sarcastic or not. the expression itself is not inherently sarcastic, but its sarcastic potential depends entirely on the tone, context, and the broader conversation in which it's used.

### label: not sarcastic

while we can't be certain without more context, in the absence of clear indicators of sarcasm, it's safer to assume that this utterance is not sarcastic. ""uh-huh"" is more commonly used as a straightforward affirmative response rather than a sarcastic one. however, this classification comes with low confidence due to the minimal information provided.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this line from chandler (likely from the tv show ""friends"") doesn't contain sarcasm. it's a straightforward request, albeit with some hesitation and awkwardness typical of chandler's character. he's genuinely asking for a copy of a tape, probably referring to something that was just recorded or discussed. the phrase ""i don't know if you got any of that"" suggests there might have been some confusion or unclear communication beforehand, but it doesn't alter the sincerity of his request.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i believe my judgment is reliable in this case, so i'm outputting the result directly.

the statement ""oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically."" by chandler doesn't contain any sarcastic elements. it appears to be a straightforward clarification that he was speaking about a hypothetical situation rather than a real one. this kind of statement is common in conversations to prevent misunderstandings, and there's no apparent contradiction between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0

this statement appears to be a straightforward, sincere comment without any apparent sarcastic elements. joey is expressing a positive opinion (""i like it"") and seems to be handing something over (""here you go""). there are no obvious cues or context that would suggest sarcasm is being employed. the language is simple and direct, typical of casual conversation, without any detectable irony or hidden meanings.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context provided in the input ""whoa, whoa, whoa,"" i don't have enough information to confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. this phrase could be used genuinely or sarcastically depending on the context and tone. therefore, i'll think through it step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""whoa, whoa, whoa"" typically expresses surprise, alarm, or a desire to slow down or pause a situation. on the surface, it appears neutral to slightly negative in sentiment.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's challenging to deduce the true intention. this phrase could be used:
- genuinely: to express genuine surprise or to ask someone to slow down
- sarcastically: to mock someone's overreaction or to express disbelief in an exaggerated manner

step 3: comparison and analysis
since we lack crucial context (such as tone of voice, preceding conversation, or body language), it's impossible to definitively determine if this is sarcastic or not. the phrase itself is ambiguous and can be used both ways.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the ambiguity of the phrase, i would lean towards classifying this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification has low confidence due to the lack of context, and the phrase could easily be sarcastic in the right situation.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"for this short input ""phoebe: okay?"", i don't have enough confidence to make a direct judgment about sarcasm without more context. let's think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. ""okay?"" is a simple, questioning form of acknowledgment or confirmation. there are no strong emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention behind this short phrase. ""okay?"" could be a genuine request for confirmation, or it could potentially have a sarcastic tone depending on the situation and how it's delivered (which we can't determine from text alone).

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the neutrality of the phrase, there's not enough information to confidently label this as sarcastic. the questioning tone could potentially be used sarcastically, but it could just as easily be a sincere question.

### label: not sarcastic

the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. rachel is expressing interest or admiration in something the other person did, as indicated by ""you're gonna have to tell me how you did that.""

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcastic intent. the statement could be genuine curiosity or admiration, or it could potentially be sarcastic if said in a certain tone or context.

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this statement from chandler appears to be a straightforward, albeit awkward, attempt to downplay the significance of a relationship or interaction. the phrase ""we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around"" is characteristic of chandler's typically casual and somewhat self-deprecating manner of speaking. there's no apparent contradiction between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm. the statement seems to genuinely express a desire to portray the relationship as casual and not serious.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be negative or frustrated. phoebe explicitly states ""i'm-i'm mad at you,"" which indicates anger or frustration.

step 2: however, the true intention seems more complex. the ""uh-huh, well!"" at the beginning and the repetition of ""i'm-i'm"" suggest hesitation or uncertainty. this could imply that phoebe is trying to convince herself or maintain anger that she doesn't fully feel.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, while there's an element of conflict between the stated emotion and the delivery, this doesn't appear to be sarcasm. phoebe seems to be genuinely attempting to express anger, even if she's struggling with it. the statement lacks the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm.

"CHANDLER: Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this,Ah-ha-ha!!","CHANDLER: What?
 JOEY: The ring is gone!
 CHANDLER: Ugh.
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive or excited, indicated by the exclamation ""ah-ha-ha!!"" which typically denotes laughter or amusement.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and phrasing suggest that chandler's true intention is to express annoyance or reluctance. the phrase ""just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this"" implies that he's not actually enthusiastic about whatever is happening. the exaggerated ""ah-ha-ha!!"" following this statement seems forced and insincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment (apparent amusement) with the likely true intention (annoyance or reluctance), there's a clear mismatch. chandler is using an exaggerated, fake-sounding laugh to emphasize his lack of genuine enthusiasm. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where someone says something that sounds positive but means the opposite.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using humor to indirectly express his true feelings of being unenthusiastic or annoyed.",1

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or frustrated. the phrase ""all right, okay"" followed by ""well, apparently not!"" suggests a sense of resignation or disappointment. the exclamation mark adds emphasis to this sentiment.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning here. however, the phrase ""apparently not"" could indicate that phoebe is reacting to something unexpected or contrary to what was previously believed or stated. the ""all right, okay"" at the beginning could be a way of accepting this new information, albeit reluctantly.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a hint of frustration or disappointment in phoebe's statement, there isn't a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement seems to be a straightforward expression of realization or acceptance that something isn't as expected.

given this analysis, i don't see strong evidence of sarcasm. the statement appears to be a genuine reaction to a situation not turning out as anticipated.

this statement appears to be a direct, non-sarcastic response expressing genuine frustration or fear after a dangerous situation. rachel is likely responding seriously to someone who may have downplayed the severity of what just happened. the phrase ""that's easy for you to say"" is often used sincerely when someone feels their experience is being minimized by others who weren't in the same situation. the reference to ""almost just killed"" further emphasizes the seriousness of the context. there are no indicators of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm in this case.",0

 PHOEBE: I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear!
",FRIENDS,0,"to accurately classify this statement, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or discouraging. the phrase ""i don't think you could ever do that"" suggests a lack of belief in someone's ability to accomplish something.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or sarcastic intent behind this statement. it could be a genuine expression of doubt or lack of confidence in someone's abilities. however, it could also be sarcastic if said in a certain tone or context, such as if phoebe actually believes the person is capable but is using reverse psychology.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators (no exaggeration, no obvious irony, no contradictory context provided), and the straightforward nature of the statement, it's more likely to be a genuine expression rather than sarcasm.

 CHANDLER: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context is incomplete and requires more analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. chandler starts with ""yes, i know,"" which seems agreeable, but then says ""but her friend sounds like such a..."" the trailing off suggests he might be about to say something negative about the friend.

step 2: true intention
without the full context or the completion of chandler's sentence, it's difficult to determine the true intention. in friends, chandler often uses sarcasm, but this snippet doesn't provide enough information to confirm if he's being sarcastic or genuinely expressing concern or dislike about someone.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the limited information, we can't confidently determine if this is sarcastic or not. chandler's character is known for sarcasm, but this snippet alone doesn't provide enough context to label it as definitively sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" because there isn't enough evidence in this short, incomplete snippet to confidently label it as sarcastic. without more context or the completion of chandler's thought, we can't assume sarcasm is present. however, this classification comes with low confidence due to the limited information provided.",0

this single-word utterance ""chandler?"" by phoebe doesn't contain any inherent sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward question or call for chandler's attention. without additional context or tone information, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. it's simply someone (phoebe) saying or calling out chandler's name, likely to get his attention or to confirm his presence.",0
"PERSON: Uh, I'm gonna kill myself!","PERSON: I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody!
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and alarming due to the extreme statement ""i'm gonna kill myself!"" this phrase typically indicates severe distress or despair.

step 2: true intention
in casual conversation, people often use hyperbolic expressions like this without literal intent. the ""uh"" at the beginning suggests a casual, off-hand tone rather than genuine distress. this type of exaggerated statement is frequently used to express frustration, disappointment, or embarrassment in a dramatic but non-literal way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is extremely negative, the casual delivery and common usage of this phrase as hyperbole suggest that the speaker likely doesn't mean it literally. the exaggeration of a minor inconvenience or embarrassment into a life-ending event is a classic format for sarcastic or humorous overreaction.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic.

this sentence appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. joey is expressing gratitude (""thanks"") but then politely declining further interaction or help because he has a problem to deal with. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this context. the language is direct and the meaning seems to align with the surface-level interpretation.",0

this short exclamation ""yeah!"" by phoebe appears to be a straightforward, genuine expression of enthusiasm or agreement. there are no contextual clues or linguistic elements that suggest any sarcastic intent. the brevity and simplicity of the statement make it unlikely to contain hidden meanings or sarcasm. therefore, i can confidently classify this as ""not sarcastic"" without needing to go through a step-by-step analysis.",0

this statement is a straightforward observation about the weather with no apparent sarcastic undertones. ross is simply pointing out that it has started to snow, which is a neutral and factual comment. there are no linguistic cues, exaggerated language, or contextual elements that would suggest sarcasm. the exclamation ""hey!"" indicates enthusiasm or drawing attention to the observation, but it doesn't imply sarcasm in this case.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine, sincere request without any signs of sarcasm. the repetition of ""please"" and the use of ""okay?"" at the end emphasize the speaker's earnestness and concern. there are no contradictory elements, exaggerated language, or ironic undertones that would suggest sarcasm. the speaker seems to be genuinely asking the other person to stay, likely in a serious or emotional context.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the statement appears to be a straightforward agreement with someone else's point, acknowledging that they are correct even when they're saying something complimentary. there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement. it seems to be a genuine observation about the truthfulness of compliments.",0

this statement appears to be a straightforward request from joey asking for someone to hand him a tile. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the language used. the tone seems neutral and the request is direct, without any hint of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
"PERSON: Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.","PERSON: Can I help you?
 CHANDLER: Uh-oh.
 JOEY: Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or neutral. the speaker is informing chloe that some guys have a crush on her and suggesting they switch places. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is less clear without more context. it could be:
a) a genuine, friendly suggestion to help chloe meet some interested guys.
b) a teasing or joking comment, possibly to embarrass chloe.
c) an attempt to get away from unwanted attention by using chloe as a diversion.

step 3: analysis and inference
without more context about the relationship between the speaker and chloe, or the tone of voice used, it's difficult to determine if this is sarcastic. the statement could be taken at face value, or it could have a hidden motive.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i'm leaning towards:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification has a lower confidence level due to the limited context provided. in a real-world scenario, factors like tone of voice, relationship between speakers, and surrounding conversation would provide more clarity.",0

 PERSON: I Why don't we do a trial run.
 PHOEBE: Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward declaration of the person's job title or role. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meaning. the sentence is brief, direct, and lacks any context that might suggest a sarcastic tone. therefore, it's reasonable to classify this as ""not sarcastic"" with a high degree of confidence.",0
ROSS: What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin van,"PHOEBE: Come on, no peeking!
 CHANDLER: Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
 PHOEBE: Okayyyyy, open up!
",FRIENDS,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the slang term ""bitchin,"" which is typically used as a positive descriptor meaning ""excellent"" or ""awesome."" the speaker, ross, seems to be expressing admiration for the van.

step 2: true intention
however, when we consider the context and language style, there are a few points to note:
1. the sentence starts with ""what did you want to show us?"" implying that something else was meant to be shown.
2. the phrase ""because all i can see is this bitchin van"" suggests that the van might not have been the intended focus.
3. the use of ""bitchin"" in this context could be interpreted as exaggerated or out of place, potentially indicating sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the structure of the sentence and the context suggest that ross might be using sarcasm. he appears to be pointing out that whatever was meant to be shown is overshadowed by the presence of the van. the exaggerated praise for the van (""bitchin"") in this context likely serves to emphasize that nothing else of note is visible or impressive.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention is likely to humorously criticize or point out that the intended object of interest is not visible or impressive compared to the van. this mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1
ROSS: You still love me?,"RACHEL: All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this short line from ross does not contain any indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward, sincere question about someone's feelings towards him. without additional context or tone indicators, there's no reason to interpret this as anything other than a genuine inquiry. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as ""not sarcastic.""",0
RACHEL: No! I'm so happy for them!,"PHOEBE: I know, they're gonna be
 RACHEL: Ohh ..   I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
 PHOEBE: Not
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the exclamation ""no!"" which can express surprise or emphasis
- the phrase ""i'm so happy for them!"" which explicitly states happiness
- the use of an exclamation mark, suggesting enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
despite the positive surface sentiment, there are potential indicators of sarcasm:
- the context is missing, which makes it harder to determine the true intention
- the name ""rachel"" in all caps might indicate a specific tone or emphasis
- the exclamation ""no!"" followed by a positive statement can sometimes be used sarcastically

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly positive, the lack of context and the potential for the ""no!"" to be used sarcastically creates some ambiguity. however, without more context or clear indicators of sarcasm, it's safer to interpret this statement at face value.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a slight possibility of sarcasm, without more context, the straightforward interpretation of genuine happiness seems more likely. the exclamation ""no!"" could simply be an expression of surprise or disbelief at good news, followed by a sincere expression of happiness.",0
"CHANDLER: Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm","CHANDLER: Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone.
 JOEY: Hello.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward admission or apology from chandler, likely in the context of a tv show or similar scenario. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the speaker is acknowledging a mistake (kissing someone's girlfriend) and seems to be in the process of explaining or justifying his actions. the tone is serious and contrite, which is not typical of sarcastic speech.",0
CHANDLER: Lovely,"MONICA: No.
 CHANDLER: How long have we been home?
 MONICA: About a half an hour.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll think through this step-by-step to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the word ""lovely"" on its own typically expresses a positive sentiment. it's often used to describe something pleasant, beautiful, or enjoyable.

step 2: true intention
however, this is chandler speaking, a character from the tv show ""friends"" known for his sarcastic humor. without more context, chandler's use of ""lovely"" is likely to be sarcastic, especially given as a one-word response. in the show, chandler often uses positive words sarcastically to express his dissatisfaction or annoyance with a situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while ""lovely"" appears positive on the surface, chandler's character and typical speech patterns suggest that he's probably using the word sarcastically. the brevity of the response (just one word) also adds to the likelihood of sarcasm, as it's a common way to deliver a sarcastic comment.

given these factors, especially chandler's well-known tendency for sarcasm, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.",1
"PERSON: Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life","MONICA: Ooh, nice.
 PERSON: So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
 MONICA: Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
",FRIENDS,0,"to accurately classify this statement, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""i've been doing a lot of thinking"" suggests introspection and self-reflection, which is often viewed as a positive activity. the speaker is also looking at their life, which could indicate a sense of evaluation or consideration.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be genuine self-reflection. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, irony, or any hidden meaning. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious rhetorical devices or unusual language style that might suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy. the statement seems to be a sincere expression of someone who has been contemplating their life. there are no contradictions or exaggerations that would typically signal sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of someone who has been reflecting on their life.",0
CHANDLER: I'm the ruptured spleen.,"MONICA: Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
 CHANDLER: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
 MONICA: What?!
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is negative or self-deprecating. chandler is referring to himself as a ""ruptured spleen,"" which is a serious and painful medical condition. this is not typically how someone would describe themselves in a literal sense.

step 2: true intention
in reality, chandler is likely not actually a ruptured spleen. this is almost certainly a metaphorical statement. given that this is a line from the character chandler in the tv show ""friends,"" we can infer that he's probably making a joke or using hyperbole to express some negative feeling or situation he's experiencing.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment (negative self-description) does not match the true intention (making a joke or expressing frustration through hyperbole). this mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

chandler's character is known for his sarcastic humor, often using self-deprecating jokes or exaggerated metaphors to express his feelings. this line fits perfectly with that pattern.

therefore, the statement ""i'm the ruptured spleen"" is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using an absurd medical condition as a metaphor to express some negative feeling or situation, but he doesn't literally mean he is a ruptured organ.",1
PHOEBE: Why?,"PERSON: Welcome back!
 PHOEBE: Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?
 PERSON: I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
",FRIENDS,0,"### response:

for this short input ""phoebe: why?"", i don't have enough context or information to confidently determine if it's sarcastic or not. the word ""why?"" on its own is a neutral question that could be asked sincerely or sarcastically depending on the broader context and tone. without more details about the situation, speaker's tone, or surrounding conversation, it's not possible to accurately classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

i've labeled it as ""not sarcastic"" by default, since there's no clear indication of sarcasm in this brief question. however, i want to emphasize that this classification has very low confidence due to the lack of context.",0
"RACHEL: Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!","RACHEL: Oh!
 MONICA: Oh God
 PHOEBE: Now you know how you really feel about it.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems slightly negative or cautionary. the phrase ""risky little game"" suggests danger or warning. the ""oh-oh"" exclamation also typically indicates concern or worry.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if rachel is being genuinely concerned or playfully teasing. the phrase ""little game"" could be diminutive, potentially implying that the risk isn't actually serious. the ""oh-oh"" could be exaggerated for effect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's not enough context to confidently determine if this is sarcastic. the surface sentiment and true intention could align (genuine concern) or contrast (playful exaggeration of a minor risk). without knowing the tone, relationship between speakers, or preceding conversation, it's hard to definitively classify this as sarcastic.

given the uncertainty, i don't feel confident labeling this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. more context would be needed for a reliable classification.",0
"PHOEBE: Oh, come on!","ROSS: When did I say you were boring?!
 PHOEBE: Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
 ROSS: Phoebe! You and I have
",FRIENDS,0,"given the short and ambiguous nature of the input ""phoebe: oh, come on!"", i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""oh, come on!"" generally expresses frustration, disbelief, or exasperation. it's often used to challenge or dismiss something that has been said or done. the surface sentiment appears negative or confrontational.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. ""oh, come on!"" can be used genuinely to express frustration, but it can also be used sarcastically in certain contexts. however, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this short phrase alone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the possible true intention, there's no clear discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the phrase appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration or disbelief. while it could potentially be used sarcastically in a larger context, there's not enough information here to confidently label it as sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

given the limited information and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, the most appropriate classification is ""not sarcastic."" however, it's important to note that with more context, this classification could potentially change.",0
"PHOEBE: Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.","CHANDLER: All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
 PHOEBE: I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration or disappointment, without any indicators of sarcasm. phoebe is directly expressing her feelings about being limited to pregnancy-related activities, which she finds disappointing or ""bumming her out."" there's no contradiction between the surface sentiment and the underlying meaning, nor any irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm. the language is plain and direct, typical of sincere communication.",0
PERSON: Hey.,"CHANDLER: Okay.
 JOEY: Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
 CHANDLER: Oh yeah man.  Joey.

for this simple greeting ""hey,"" there's no need for a step-by-step analysis. it's a straightforward, neutral greeting without any indicators of sarcasm. there are no contrasting surface sentiments or hidden meanings to consider. it's just a brief, common way to initiate a conversation, so we can confidently classify it as not sarcastic.",0
"RACHEL: This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not,that's-that's not what it is.","RACHEL: Ohh! It's so nice to meet you.  Hello. Hello.
 PERSON: Well, Joshua, that 500 was for groceries.
 RACHEL: What?
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context and intent aren't immediately clear to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative or anxious. this is indicated by:
- repetition of ""no"" and ""not""
- stuttering/stammering effect created by repeated words and hyphens
- overall tone of denial or rejection

step 2: true intention
analyzing the true intention:
- this appears to be dialogue, likely from a script (character name ""rachel"" is given)
- the repetitive, flustered speech pattern suggests genuine anxiety or distress
- there's no clear indication of irony or an attempt at humor
- the speaker seems to be earnestly trying to deny or refute something

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface sentiment and true intention:
- both the surface sentiment and underlying intention align
- there's no apparent mismatch between what's said and what's meant
- the speech pattern indicates genuine emotion rather than an attempt at sarcasm
- there are no clear rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would suggest sarcasm

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence that this statement is not sarcastic. it appears to be a genuine, anxious response in a dialogue.

### label: not sarcastic",0
"JOEY: Whoa, maybe I was!","JOEY: Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady.
",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context of this single line from joey, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether this statement is sarcastic or not without more information about the conversation or situation. therefore, i'll think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or sudden realization, indicated by the exclamation ""whoa"" and the use of ""maybe."" the tone seems neutral to slightly positive.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's challenging to deduce the true intention. however, the phrase ""maybe i was"" suggests that joey is considering a possibility he hadn't before, or is playfully agreeing with something someone else said. the use of ""maybe"" could indicate genuine uncertainty or could be a rhetorical device for humorous effect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information, there isn't a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the possible true intention. the statement doesn't contain obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, contradiction, or irony. while it's possible that in a larger context this could be a sarcastic remark, based solely on this line, it appears more likely to be a genuine expression of surprise or realization.

however, i want to emphasize that this classification has a lower confidence level due to the lack of context, and could potentially change if more information about the conversation were provided.",0
"CHANDLER: Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?","MONICA: Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this line from chandler in the tv show friends doesn't appear to contain any sarcasm. it's a straightforward question where chandler is asking permission for his friends to visit. the tone seems genuine and there are no indicators of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the context and delivery of the line in the show would typically be sincere, with chandler genuinely asking about his friends visiting.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward revelation of personal information without any sarcastic intent. phoebe is sharing a significant fact about her family history - that her mother's friend named phoebe is actually her birth mother. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the language or context provided. the tone seems sincere and matter-of-fact, appropriate for disclosing such personal information.",0
"CHANDLER: Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.","MONICA: I know, it is isn't it?
 CHANDLER: No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
 MONICA: Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems serious, as chandler is stating he needs to leave because a lifeguard is about to dismantle a nuclear device.

step 2: the true intention is clearly not literal. lifeguards are not typically involved in dismantling nuclear devices. this is an absurd and exaggerated excuse to leave a conversation or situation.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's a clear mismatch between the surface statement and the realistic situation. chandler is using an outlandish, impossible scenario as an excuse, which is a classic form of sarcasm. the absurdity of the statement is meant to be humorous and not taken literally.

therefore, this statement is definitely sarcastic. it's a typical example of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic and witty remarks.",1

PHOEBE: That oughta do it.,"RACHEL: Where's Chandler?
 PHOEBE: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
 CHANDLER: I'm free! I'm free!
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the context isn't entirely clear:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the phrase ""that oughta do it"" generally expresses a positive or neutral sentiment. it suggests that something has been completed or a solution has been found.

step 2: true intention:
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. this phrase can be used sincerely to indicate that a task is finished, or it could potentially be used sarcastically if the speaker doesn't actually believe the action will solve the problem.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
given the lack of context and the ambiguity of the phrase, it's not possible to confidently determine if this is sarcastic or not. the phrase itself is neutral and can be used both sincerely and sarcastically depending on the situation.

this statement appears to be a straightforward, serious declaration without any sarcastic elements. ross is directly communicating important information about a relationship situation, likely in a sincere and potentially emotional context. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or other hallmarks of sarcasm in this text. the hesitation (""umm"") and the repetition (""there's-there's"") suggest genuineness and difficulty in delivering this news, rather than any attempt at humor or sarcasm.",0
"CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.","ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
 CHANDLER: So, let's go.
 ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and considerate. chandler is expressing that leaving now would be ""rude"" to others, suggesting a polite and thoughtful attitude.

step 2: however, knowing chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" this statement likely has a different intention. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor and often uses it to deflect or avoid uncomfortable situations. the true intention is probably to stay longer not out of genuine consideration for others, but for some personal benefit or to avoid something else.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there's a clear discrepancy. chandler is using politeness and consideration as a pretense, while his real motive is probably self-serving or avoidant. this mismatch between the stated reason and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 RACHEL: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
",FRIENDS,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the use of the word ""hero"" typically conveys admiration and praise. the statement seems to be complimenting someone for working or staying awake for twenty-one hours.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention may be different. working for 21 hours straight is generally considered unhealthy and potentially dangerous. calling someone a ""hero"" for doing this could be an exaggeration used to highlight the absurdity or unhealthiness of the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface praise (""hero"") and the likely negative view of such long work hours suggests this statement is likely sarcastic. the speaker is probably criticizing the notion that working for such extended periods is admirable or heroic.

the statement ""twenty-one hours, you're a hero"" is likely meant sarcastically to critique the glorification of overwork or unhealthy work habits.",1

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the statement ""monica: no!! you have been screwing us all day!"" appears to be a direct, angry expression of frustration rather than sarcasm. the exclamation marks and strong language indicate genuine upset or anger. in this context, ""screwing"" likely means causing problems or difficulties, and monica seems to be directly accusing someone of doing this throughout the day. there's no subtle irony or mismatch between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the statement is straightforward and confrontational, expressing clear negative sentiment without any apparent attempt at humor or irony.",0
"RACHEL: I did not mean to touch that,I mean","RACHEL: Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input, i'll think through this step-by-step as my confidence is less than 90% for this statement.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly negative. rachel is stating that she didn't mean to touch something, which could indicate a mistake or accident. the phrase ""i mean"" at the end suggests she might be about to explain or clarify further.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be genuine. rachel appears to be honestly admitting to an accidental action and possibly preparing to explain or apologize. there are no clear rhetorical devices or unusual language styles that would indicate a hidden meaning or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy or irony. the statement appears straightforward and sincere. there are no contextual clues or linguistic patterns that would suggest sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement ""i did not mean to touch that, i mean"" appears to be a genuine expression of an unintended action, without any indicators of sarcasm.",0
ROSS: I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.,"ROSS: Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
 PERSON: Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward declaration of a fact or situation without any apparent sarcastic elements. ross is simply stating that he has a teaching obligation in the near future. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradictory elements that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems neutral and informative, consistent with someone mentioning their upcoming schedule or responsibility.",0
ROSS: I was thkinking about maybe going into the Robot.,"MONICA: Hey, you haven't been practising the routine have you?
 ROSS: No!
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear and there could be multiple interpretations:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral. ross is stating a thought about a potential action (going into the robot). there are no obvious sentimental keywords, phrases, or emojis.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. the phrase ""going into the robot"" is unusual and could be:
a) a literal statement about entering a large robot structure
b) a metaphor for joining a robotics-related field
c) a reference to something specific in the context of a larger conversation or show

step 3: analysis and conclusion
given the limited information and the ambiguity of the statement, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the statement appears to be straightforward, albeit somewhat cryptic without additional context. 

### label: not sarcastic

while i can't be 100% certain without more context, the statement doesn't show clear markers of sarcasm, so i've labeled it as ""not sarcastic.""",0
ROSS: Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.,"ROSS: No, come on don't start. Ouch!
 PERSON: What?
 ROSS: Stupid balls are in the way.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive or neutral. the phrase ""most constructive solution"" suggests a positive outcome. ""oh well"" could indicate mild disappointment or acceptance.

step 2: true intention
considering this is a line from ross (likely from the tv show friends), and knowing his character's tendency for dry humor, there's likely more to this statement. the phrase ""most constructive solution"" seems exaggerated, especially when preceded by ""oh well,"" which often indicates resignation or disappointment. this combination suggests that ross might actually be implying the opposite - that the solution was not constructive at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) presents a seemingly positive or neutral statement about a ""constructive solution."" however, the true intention (step 2) likely contradicts this, using exaggeration and a resigned tone to imply the opposite. this mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
"JOEY: Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.","JOEY: Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
 MONICA: Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?

this statement appears to be a straightforward description without any apparent sarcastic elements. joey is simply describing something as ""old and dingy,"" which seems to be a direct and literal characterization without any hidden meaning or irony that would suggest sarcasm.",0
PHOEBE: Yeah?,"PHOEBE: Hi!
 JOEY: Hey!
 JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i can output this result directly as i'm quite confident in this judgment. the input text is a single word response ""yeah?"" from a character named phoebe. this short affirmative response with a question intonation doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward, genuine response, likely seeking confirmation or prompting the other person to continue speaking. there's no contrast between surface sentiment and deeper meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
JOEY: Uh-huh!,"ROSS: I've had better.
 JOEY: Okay! When?!
 ROSS: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
",FRIENDS,0,"for this short input ""joey: uh-huh!"", i don't have enough context or information to confidently determine if it's sarcastic or not. the phrase ""uh-huh"" can be used sincerely or sarcastically depending on the context, tone, and situation. without more details, i can't reliably classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic.

to make a more informed decision, i would need:
1. more context about the conversation
2. information about joey's tone of voice or body language
3. the topic being discussed
4. the relationship between joey and the other person(s) in the conversation

given the lack of information, i cannot provide a definitive label for this input. it could be either sarcastic or not sarcastic depending on the broader context.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this input is very brief and straightforward, without any obvious indicators of sarcasm. the phrase ""the end"" is commonly used to simply signify the conclusion of a story, speech, or other form of communication. without any additional context or contradictory elements, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. therefore, i can confidently classify this as ""not sarcastic"" without needing to go through a step-by-step analysis.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"for this input, i'll provide a direct response as the text does not appear to contain any sarcastic elements:

### label: not sarcastic

the given text seems to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic dialogue. it appears to be someone inviting another person in, possibly ending a phone call or conversation, and suggesting they think about something and call back later. there are no indicators of sarcasm or hidden meanings in this casual, everyday exchange.",0
CHANDLER: Pheebs?,"CHANDLER: I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here!
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this is a straightforward, one-word utterance from the character chandler in what appears to be a script or dialogue. ""pheebs?"" is likely a shortened version of ""phoebe,"" presumably addressing another character.

there's no context provided that would suggest any sarcastic intent. it appears to be a simple call or question to get phoebe's attention. without any additional context or tone indicators, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic.

this kind of short, direct address is common in casual conversation and doesn't inherently carry any sarcastic connotations. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this input.",0
"PHOEBE: Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good .. pill.","PHOEBE: Yeah.
 RACHEL: I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
",FRIENDS,1,"to analyze this statement for sarcasm, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the word ""good"" is used, which typically has a positive connotation. the statement seems to be offering a suggestion or agreement with taking a pill as a solution.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are a few clues that suggest this might not be a straightforward, positive statement:
1. the repetition of ""yeah"" at the beginning could indicate hesitation or doubt.
2. the use of "".."" (ellipsis) suggests a pause or uncertainty.
3. the vague reference to ""a good .. pill"" without specifying what kind of pill or what it's for is unusual and could be interpreted as dismissive or sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral to positive, the underlying tone and structure of the sentence suggest skepticism or mockery. the vagueness of ""a good .. pill"" as a solution to an unspecified problem could be interpreted as phoebe sarcastically suggesting that medication is an oversimplified or inappropriate solution.

given this analysis, i believe there's a strong possibility that this statement is sarcastic. however, without more context about the conversation or phoebe's character, i can't be 100% certain.

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through step-by-step analysis. the sentence ""can't do it, can you?"" is a straightforward question that doesn't contain any obvious sarcastic elements. it appears to be a simple, direct inquiry about someone's inability to do something, rather than a sarcastic remark.

the context is limited, but the phrasing suggests a genuine question or possibly a light taunt, but not sarcasm. sarcasm typically involves saying something that means the opposite of what is literally stated, often with an intent to mock or criticize. this statement doesn't exhibit those characteristics.",0
"ROSS: Yeah, she's fired.","PHOEBE: Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!

PHOEBE: I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!,"RACHEL: Pheebs, that's great!
 PHOEBE: Oh, yay!
 RACHEL: But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
",FRIENDS,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and frustrated. key indicators:
- ""it's so hard!""
- ""nothing rhymes""
- ""stupid name""
these phrases express difficulty and irritation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. this appears to be a genuine expression of frustration from phoebe about trying to rhyme someone's name. the exclamation marks and the use of ""stupid"" to describe the name further emphasize her genuine annoyance.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment and the true intention seem to match. there's no indication of irony or saying one thing but meaning another. the frustration appears genuine and straightforward, without any hidden meaning or attempt at humor through sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

JOEY: Take a couple deep breaths.,"JOEY: Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward, sincere piece of advice without any indicators of sarcasm. joey is likely genuinely suggesting that someone take deep breaths to calm down or relax. there are no contradictory elements, exaggerated language, or ironic undertones that would typically signal sarcasm. the advice to take deep breaths is a common and practical suggestion for managing stress or anxiety, which supports the interpretation that this is a sincere, non-sarcastic statement.",0
"MONICA: No no, you don't have to fly back, really.","MONICA: Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone.
",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context provided, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be reassuring or accommodating. monica is saying ""no no, you don't have to fly back, really."" this seems to indicate that she's telling someone they don't need to make the effort to return.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, the repetition of ""no"" and the addition of ""really"" at the end could potentially indicate:
a) genuine insistence that the person doesn't need to return
b) a polite way of saying they don't want the person to return
c) a subtle hint that they actually do want the person to return, but are trying to be polite

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the statement appears to be straightforward, even if there might be some nuanced social dynamics at play. without more context or cues (like tone of voice, body language, or preceding conversation), it's safest to interpret this as a genuine statement.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a possibility of subtle sarcasm or hidden meaning, based solely on the text provided, there isn't enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the statement appears to be a sincere attempt to reassure someone that they don't need to make an unnecessary trip.",0

given the very limited input, i would say:

### label: not sarcastic

i'm choosing ""not sarcastic"" as the default because there's no clear evidence of sarcasm in this brief exchange. however, i want to emphasize that this classification has very low confidence without more context.",0
PHOEBE: Okay?,"PHOEBE: Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan.
",FRIENDS,0,"given the extremely brief input ""phoebe: okay?"", there's not enough context or information to confidently determine whether this is sarcastic or not. the word ""okay"" on its own can be used sincerely or sarcastically depending on tone, context, and delivery. without more details, i don't have 90% confidence in making a judgment. let's think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. ""okay"" can express agreement, understanding, or be used as a question seeking confirmation. there are no clear sentimental keywords or emojis.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's impossible to determine the true intention behind this ""okay?"". it could be a genuine question seeking clarification, or it could be a sarcastic response implying disagreement or disbelief.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the ambiguity of ""okay?"" used on its own, there's not enough information to confidently determine whether this is sarcastic or not.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" as the default label because there's no clear evidence of sarcasm. however, this classification has very low confidence due to the lack of context. in reality, this could be sarcastic or not sarcastic depending on the broader conversation and the speaker's tone.",0
"PERSON: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.","CHANDLER: Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context and lack of clear sarcastic indicators in this short dialogue, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""hi"", ""very nice"", and ""well well, look what you brought"" suggest a friendly and appreciative tone.

step 2: true intention
without more context, the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker appears to be genuinely greeting joey and expressing approval or admiration for something joey has brought. the repetition of ""well well"" could be a sincere expression of pleasant surprise.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. the language is straightforward and doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or unexpected contrasts.

### label: not sarcastic

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, based on this brief exchange alone, there are no strong indicators of sarcasm. the dialogue appears to be a genuine, positive interaction.",0
RACHEL: What was that?!,"PHOEBE: Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
 RACHEL: Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!

",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context provided in the input ""rachel: what was that?!"", i don't have enough information to confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the statement is too short and ambiguous to make a reliable judgment without more context. it could be a genuine question or potentially sarcastic depending on the situation and tone, which are not clear from this brief text alone.

since my confidence is less than 90%, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be surprise or confusion, as indicated by the use of ""what"" and the exclamation mark.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's impossible to determine if there's a hidden intention beyond the literal question. it could be a genuine query about something unexpected, or it could potentially be sarcastic if rachel is reacting to something obvious or predictable.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the absence of context, it's more likely that this is a straightforward question expressing genuine surprise or confusion.

### label: not sarcastic

the input ""phoebe: yeah?"" is a very brief and straightforward response that doesn't contain enough context or complexity to suggest sarcasm. it appears to be a simple affirmative or questioning response, likely in a conversation. without additional context or tone indicators, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. therefore, i can confidently classify this as ""not sarcastic"" without needing to go through the step-by-step analysis.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement from ross appears to be a genuine, heartfelt comment about the joy of having a child, rather than a sarcastic remark. the context suggests he's talking to someone who is pregnant or about to become a parent. the sentiment is positive and encouraging, highlighting the deep love a parent feels for their child. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the statement is straightforward and sincere in its message about the upcoming arrival of a baby and the profound emotional connection that comes with parenthood.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context provided in the input, i don't have enough information to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the statement ""that is the coast guard!"" appears to be a straightforward, factual observation. there are no obvious sentimental keywords, phrases, or emojis. the exclamation mark suggests some level of emphasis or excitement.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention behind this statement. it could be:
a) a genuine observation of seeing the coast guard
b) an excited exclamation upon recognizing the coast guard
c) a sarcastic comment implying that something or someone is definitely not the coast guard

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the ambiguity of the statement, it's not possible to confidently determine whether this is sarcastic or not. the statement itself doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm, but sarcasm often relies heavily on context and tone, which are not provided here.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward, literal description without any apparent sarcastic elements. the phrase ""ah well"" at the beginning might indicate a casual or slightly resigned tone, but it doesn't suggest sarcasm. the speaker seems to be simply pointing out the living room, likely during a house tour or introduction to a space. there's no discernible mismatch between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0

label: not sarcastic

this sentence is a simple statement about an action the person took. there are no linguistic cues, exaggerations, contradictions, or contextual elements that would suggest sarcasm. it's a neutral, factual statement about calling a friend, which is a common, everyday occurrence. without any additional context or tone indicators that might suggest otherwise, this statement can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0
"RACHEL: Even if people are on it!""","RACHEL: You know what else I'm not gonna miss? ""I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
",FRIENDS,1,"i don't have enough context to confidently classify this single line of dialogue as sarcastic or not sarcastic. without knowing the full conversation or situation rachel is responding to, it's difficult to determine if there's any sarcastic intent. let's break it down step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be one of concern or caution, given the phrase ""even if people are on it!"" the exclamation mark suggests emphasis or urgency.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's impossible to determine if there's a hidden meaning or sarcastic undertone. rachel could be genuinely expressing concern about a situation where people's presence doesn't mitigate a risk, or she could be sarcastically commenting on something obvious.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the brevity of the statement, there isn't enough information to confidently detect sarcasm. the statement could be entirely sincere or potentially sarcastic depending on the broader conversation and rachel's tone of voice (which we can't determine from text alone).

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" as the default label because there isn't enough evidence to conclude that sarcasm is present. however, i want to emphasize that this classification has low confidence due to the limited context provided.",0
ROSS: I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I,"ROSS: Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't clear enough for a direct judgment.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be apologetic. ross begins with ""i-i'm really sorry,"" which indicates remorse or regret. the stuttering ""i-i'm"" could suggest nervousness or sincerity in the apology.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. the sentence is incomplete (""it's just that i""), which leaves the true intention ambiguous. in a typical conversation, this could be a genuine apology followed by an explanation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the incomplete nature of the sentence and lack of context make it challenging to detect any mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention. the stuttering and apologetic tone seem more consistent with genuine remorse than sarcasm.

given the limited information and the apparent sincerity of the apology, i would lean towards classifying this as not sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification is made with low confidence due to the incomplete sentence and lack of context. more information would be needed for a more definitive classification.",0
"JOEY: Yeah well that's because uh .. I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.","RACHEL: Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
 JOEY: Yeah me too, all night. Really?!
 RACHEL: How come we didn't cross paths?
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement by joey appears to be a straightforward, albeit somewhat embarrassed, admission about his personal habits. there's no apparent contradiction between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm. joey is likely being honest about staying in his room and implying that his laundry hamper is in an unpleasant state as a result. the tone seems more self-deprecating than sarcastic.",0
"RACHEL: I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?","RACHEL: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""i guess you'd know that"" could be interpreted as acknowledging someone's knowledge or expertise. there are no overtly negative words or strong emotional indicators.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the phrase ""being one of the two of us"" suggests a context where rachel is likely pointing out something obvious or self-evident. the ""though, right?"" at the end adds a questioning tone that seems to challenge or mock the other person's intelligence or awareness.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment doesn't immediately flag this as sarcastic, the true intention appears to be mocking or belittling. rachel is likely pointing out something extremely obvious in a way that implies the other person should already know this, thus indirectly criticizing their intelligence or awareness. this discrepancy between the seemingly neutral surface and the underlying critical intent is a hallmark of sarcasm.

PHOEBE: Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!,"CHANDLER: Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
 PHOEBE: Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
 CHANDLER: What?
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of regret and frustration. key phrases like ""i'm sorry"" and ""i tried to stop it"" indicate an apologetic tone. the mention of being put in jail suggests a serious situation and adds to the negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, this statement seems highly exaggerated and unlikely to be literal. the idea that someone would be put in jail for trying to stop a sale is absurd in most normal contexts. this exaggeration and the sudden escalation to jail time suggests that the speaker (phoebe) is likely not being serious.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the seemingly sincere apology and regret in step 1 and the absurd exaggeration identified in step 2 strongly indicates that this statement is meant to be humorous rather than sincere. the exaggeration is used for comedic effect, which is a common feature of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses exaggeration and absurdity to create a humorous effect, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.",1
"PERSON: Almost! But first, we gotta start.","RACHEL: All right, I'm outta here!
 MONICA: I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
 RACHEL: So were done then!
",FRIENDS,1,"since this statement is relatively short and straightforward, i believe i can make a reliable judgment without going through the step-by-step process.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic response. it's a simple observation or correction, pointing out that something needs to be started before proceeding. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the phrase ""almost!"" suggests sincerity in acknowledging that the previous statement or action was close to being correct or complete, but not quite there yet. the follow-up ""but first, we gotta start"" is a straightforward instruction or reminder. the casual language (""gotta"") further reinforces the impression of a sincere, informal communication rather than a sarcastic remark.",0
CHANDLER: You building a post office?,"JOEY: Hey, we know how we always say we need a place for the mail? Well I started building one, but then, I decided to take it to the next step.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. it's a simple question about building a post office, without any obvious positive or negative emotional indicators.

step 2: true intention
in context, this line is likely from the tv show ""friends"" and spoken by chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor. the question ""you building a post office?"" is probably not meant literally. it's likely a rhetorical question used to comment on someone's behavior or appearance, possibly implying they have an excessive amount of something (perhaps mail or packages).

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention is likely to make a humorous, exaggerated observation. the question format is used not to genuinely inquire, but to make a point in a witty way. this mismatch between the literal question and the implied meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a seemingly innocuous question to make a humorous, exaggerated observation, which is a classic sarcastic technique employed by chandler's character in ""friends.""",1
ROSS: Stick to the list.,"RACHEL: Ahh!
 PERSON: It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
 RACHEL: A scooter!
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this short phrase ""stick to the list"" appears to be a straightforward instruction or command without any obvious sarcastic elements. it's likely a direct statement meant to be taken at face value, possibly in the context of following a shopping list or adhering to a plan. without additional context or tone indicators, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic.",0
ROSS: Uh yes! Thank you.,"RACHEL: We're not gonna do that.
 PERSON1: Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.
 PERSON2: Am I interrupting?
",FRIENDS,1,"i think i should step through this carefully to be more certain:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the ""uh yes!"" exclamation and ""thank you"" are typically indicators of agreement and gratitude.

step 2: however, the ""uh"" at the beginning could potentially indicate hesitation or reluctance. without more context about what ross is responding to, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm.

step 3: given the limited context and the generally positive words used, there isn't enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the ""uh"" creates some ambiguity, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own to override the straightforward positive sentiment.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a slight possibility of sarcasm due to the ""uh"", without more context, it's safer to interpret this as a genuine, if somewhat hesitant, expression of thanks.",0
PHOEBE: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.,"RACHEL: Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
 MONICA: For what?
 RACHEL: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this line appears to be a straightforward statement without any clear indicators of sarcasm. phoebe seems to be genuinely apologizing for two things: first, for something unspecified (likely mentioned in a previous part of the conversation), and second, for forgetting to invite someone to an event.

the statement is direct and doesn't contain any typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. it sounds like a sincere apology, which is generally not delivered sarcastically in normal conversation.

without more context, and given the straightforward nature of the statement, it's reasonable to conclude that this is not a sarcastic comment.",0

",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this question from phoebe appears to be a straightforward inquiry about how ross's interaction with bonnie went. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this statement. the hesitation (""umm"") and repetition (""how... how"") suggest genuine curiosity or perhaps a bit of awkwardness, but not sarcasm. the question is direct and seems to be seeking actual information, which is characteristic of non-sarcastic communication.",0
MONICA: What are you up too?,"JOEY: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.

this straightforward question from monica doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. it's a common, casual way to inquire about someone's activities or plans. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface meaning and the intended meaning, nor any signs of irony or mockery. the phrase ""what are you up to?"" is typically used sincerely to start a conversation or show interest in another person's activities.",0
PERSON: Yes it is.,"PHOEBE: Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer,fireman, can-can I help you?
 PERSON: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute. That's not mine.
",FRIENDS,0,"i don't have enough context to confidently determine if this short statement ""yes it is."" is sarcastic or not. without more information about the conversation or situation, it's not possible to reliably classify such a brief, neutral response. to make an accurate sarcasm judgment, i would need additional context clues, tone indicators, or surrounding dialogue. given just these three words, i cannot assign a sarcasm label with any reasonable degree of confidence.",1
ROSS: So how'd it go?,"ROSS: Yeah. He could row like a viking.
 MONICA: Hi.
",FRIENDS,0,"for this input, i don't have enough context or information to confidently classify it as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the phrase ""so how'd it go?"" is a neutral question that could be asked sincerely or sarcastically depending on the context, tone, and surrounding conversation. without more details, i cannot make a reliable judgment.

to properly classify this, we would need:
1. more of the conversation for context
2. information about the tone of voice or facial expressions if it was spoken
3. knowledge of the relationship between ross and the person he's talking to
4. understanding of what event or situation ""it"" refers to

given the lack of context, i cannot provide a definitive label for this input. it could be either sarcastic or not sarcastic depending on the surrounding circumstances.",0
MONICA: What is the matter with your face?!,"MONICA: Let's try a look .. of far off .. wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler!
",FRIENDS,0,"to properly classify this statement, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or concerned. the phrase ""what is the matter with"" typically indicates worry or criticism about something unusual or wrong. the exclamation mark adds intensity to the question.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. this could be a genuine expression of concern or surprise about someone's facial appearance. however, it could also potentially be an exaggerated reaction for comedic effect, depending on the situation and relationship between the speakers.

step 3: analysis and inference
given the limited context and the straightforward nature of the question, there isn't strong evidence to suggest this is sarcastic. while the tone might be dramatic (indicated by the exclamation mark), it appears to be a direct question about someone's facial appearance.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a possibility this could be sarcastic in a broader context, based solely on the information provided, it seems more likely to be a genuine, albeit dramatic, question.",0
RACHEL: It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.,"PHOEBE: Definitely!
 RACHEL: Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of rachel's desire for some assurance or certainty. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the sentiment expressed aligns with the literal meaning of the words, suggesting a genuine wish for a ""guarantee"" in whatever context the conversation is taking place.",0
PERSON: Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!,"RACHEL: Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
 PERSON: Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game. Ohh that's nice.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward account of an experience without any apparent sarcastic undertones. the person is describing a social situation where they went to a bar and someone (presumably a friend or acquaintance) introduced them to women. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the tone seems enthusiastic and positive about the described event, which is consistent with a non-sarcastic recounting of a night out.",0
MONICA: I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.,"CHANDLER: You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
 MONICA: Are you serious?!
 CHANDLER: Yes! I love you!
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of deep affection and love. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in monica's declaration. the use of superlative language (""never loved anybody as much"") and the direct statement of love are typical of sincere romantic expressions. without any additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement should be taken at face value as a heartfelt confession of love.",0
"JOEY: No just, nobody press on my stomach.","MONICA: Well Joey, we're all .. we're all very proud of you.
 CHANDLER: Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
 PHOEBE: Is there anything we can do for you?
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward request or warning from joey, without any apparent sarcastic elements. the context suggests joey is likely in a situation where he doesn't want pressure applied to his stomach, possibly due to pain or discomfort. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrast between surface meaning and intended meaning that would typically characterize sarcasm. the statement is direct and literal, making it not sarcastic.",0
"ROSS: Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?","PHOEBE: I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
 ROSS: Oh my God! Of course, of course.
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward, polite request to be excused, without any apparent sarcastic elements. the phrase ""would you please excuse me"" is a common, sincere way to politely leave a conversation or situation. there are no contextual clues or linguistic markers that suggest sarcasm is being employed here. the tone seems genuinely courteous and direct, making it highly likely that this is a non-sarcastic statement.",0
RACHEL: No.,"ROSS: Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
",FRIENDS,0,"given the extremely brief input ""rachel: no."", i don't have enough context or information to confidently determine whether this is sarcastic or not. the word ""no"" on its own doesn't inherently indicate sarcasm. therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is negative or refusing, as indicated by the word ""no.""

step 2: true intention
without any additional context, tone indicators, or surrounding dialogue, it's impossible to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcastic intention behind this simple ""no.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
since we lack context and the statement is so brief, there's no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and any potential true intention that we can discern.

based on this analysis, there's no evidence of sarcasm in this single-word response. therefore, the most appropriate label would be:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification is made with low confidence due to the lack of context. in real-world scenarios, sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, context, and the relationship between speakers, none of which we have access to here.",0
MONICA: Am I out of control?,"MONICA: Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the context isn't entirely clear without more information:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly negative. monica is asking a question about her own behavior, specifically if she is ""out of control."" this phrase typically has a negative connotation, suggesting excessive or unmanageable behavior.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention behind this question. it could be:
1. a genuine question of self-reflection
2. a rhetorical question in response to someone else's accusation
3. an exaggerated statement meant to be humorous

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited context, there isn't enough information to confidently determine if this statement is sarcastic. the question itself is straightforward and could easily be sincere. however, sarcasm often relies heavily on tone and context, which are missing here.

due to the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the straightforward nature of the question, i'm inclined to label this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification has a lower confidence level due to the limited context provided. in a fuller conversation or with more information about monica's tone or the situation, the interpretation could potentially change.",0
ROSS: If you wanna put a label on it.,"PERSON: That's funny. Who are they?
 ROSS: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
 PERSON: You mean they're lovers.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement by ross doesn't appear to contain any sarcastic elements. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit somewhat casual or dismissive, response to someone trying to categorize or label something. the phrase ""if you wanna put a label on it"" is a common expression used to indicate a lack of strong preference or commitment to a particular classification. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface meaning and the intended meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
JOEY: But I'm the host!,"PERSON: This will be your phone.
 JOEY: That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
 PERSON: No you answer it and take pledges.
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of assertion or protest. the use of ""but"" at the beginning suggests a counterargument, and the exclamation mark indicates emphasis or strong feeling. the statement ""i'm the host!"" seems to express a straightforward claim of a role or position.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. the statement could be genuine - joey might actually be the host and is asserting this fact. however, in certain contexts, this could also be a sarcastic comment if, for instance, joey is not actually the host or if his role as host is being ignored or undermined.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited context and the straightforward nature of the statement, there isn't strong evidence to suggest sarcasm. while sarcasm is possible depending on the broader context, the default interpretation of this statement would be a non-sarcastic assertion of joey's role as the host.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a possibility of sarcasm depending on broader context not provided here, based on the information available, the statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic assertion.",0
CHANDLER: I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.,"MONICA: Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
 CHANDLER: Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
 MONICA: My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: on the surface, this statement seems like a straightforward offer to show something at a cost of ""one husband.""

step 2: however, the true intention is not literal. chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the show ""friends,"" is making a joke. the idea of ""costing one husband"" is not a real price or offer, but a humorous exaggeration.

step 3: the sarcasm comes from the mismatch between the casual way chandler offers to show something and the absurdly high ""price"" of a husband. this hyperbole is a classic sarcastic technique, using overstatement for comedic effect.

the line is clearly not meant to be taken literally, and the humor derives from its sarcastic nature. therefore, the label is ""sarcastic.""",1
"MONICA: Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!","CHANDLER: Do you know what just happened?
 MONICA: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
 CHANDLER: No. We were in the middle of sex .. and
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. monica uses phrases like ""best time ever!"" and ""you rocked my world!"" which are typically associated with enthusiasm and enjoyment.

step 2: however, the true intention seems different. the sentence starts with ""nooo! no, that's not true."" this strong denial contradicts the positive statements that follow. the exaggerated positivity (""yeah, you rocked my world!"") after such a strong denial suggests insincerity.

step 3: comparing the initial denial with the overly positive statements that follow, we can infer that monica is not being genuine in her praise. the stark contrast between her initial reaction and subsequent comments indicates sarcasm. she's likely saying the opposite of what she truly feels to emphasize her actual disappointment or disagreement.

### label: sarcastic",1
"RACHEL: Seriously, it's moving!","PHOEBE: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
 ROSS: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
 PHOEBE: Oh, it's not!
",FRIENDS,0,"given the limited context provided in this single line of dialogue, i don't have enough information to confidently determine if this statement is sarcastic or not. therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of excitement or surprise. the use of ""seriously"" and the exclamation mark suggest genuine emphasis.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. ""seriously, it's moving!"" could be a genuine expression of amazement if something unexpected is actually moving. however, it could also be sarcastic if used in a context where nothing is actually moving or the movement is extremely slow or insignificant.

step 3: comparison and analysis
due to the lack of context, we can't definitively determine if there's a mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention. the statement could be entirely sincere or potentially sarcastic depending on the situation.

given this analysis, i don't have enough information to confidently classify this statement as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. more context about the situation, rachel's tone, or the responses of other characters would be needed for a more accurate classification.",0
"MONICA: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.","RACHEL: I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... And Monica knows…
 ROSS: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward recounting of events without any apparent sarcasm. monica is simply relaying information about a phone call she received from carol, who thanked her for lasagna. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the tone, word choice, or context of this statement.",0
"JOEY: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....","JOEY: Hey. What, what are you doing here?
 PHOEBE: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
",FRIENDS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear, and there's not enough information to make a confident judgment immediately.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. joey is speaking about ""fulfilling their christmas,"" which typically has positive connotations. the use of ""look now"" and ""remember"" suggests he's trying to reassure or remind phoebe of something.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. the sentence is incomplete, ending with an ellipsis (...), which could indicate that there's more to the statement that we're not seeing. this makes it challenging to infer any hidden meanings or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analyze
given the limited information and the incomplete nature of the sentence, there's not enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the surface sentiment and the apparent intention seem to align, with joey appearing to genuinely remind or reassure phoebe about something related to christmas.

### label: not sarcastic

while i can't be 100% certain without more context, based on the available information, this statement appears to be sincere rather than sarcastic. joey seems to be genuinely trying to explain or remind phoebe about something related to christmas activities or traditions.",0
"ROSS: No, no, no, it's flattery.","PERSON: Aren't you with that girl over there?
 ROSS: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
",FRIENDS,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""it's flattery"" typically indicates a compliment or praise, which is generally positive.

step 2: however, the context is crucial here. the repeated ""no, no, no"" at the beginning suggests a strong denial or disagreement. this repetition could indicate frustration or an attempt to correct a misunderstanding. the speaker (ross) seems to be insisting that something is flattery when it might not actually be perceived that way by others.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's a contradiction between the initial denial and the claim of flattery. this could suggest that ross is being sarcastic, possibly trying to pass off an insult or criticism as a compliment. however, without more context, it's difficult to be entirely certain.

given the limited context and the potential for multiple interpretations, i cannot confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the statement could be genuine (ross truly believes something is flattery) or sarcastic (ross is ironically calling something insulting ""flattery""). more context would be needed for a definitive classification.",0
"CHANDLER: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.","CHANDLER: Hey Pheebs!
 PHOEBE: Ohh! You made up!
 MONICA: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. chandler is saying that a woman (presumably) couldn't live without his love, which on the surface sounds like a boastful but sincere statement about his romantic appeal.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing chandler's character from the tv show friends, this is almost certainly not meant to be taken at face value. chandler is known for his self-deprecating humor and sarcasm. the phrase ""chan love"" is particularly telling - it's an exaggerated, silly way to refer to himself that's inconsistent with genuine boasting.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is positive and boastful, the true intention is likely the opposite. chandler is probably making fun of himself or the situation, using overconfident language ironically. the disconnect between the surface meaning and the likely true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, the statement is classified as sarcastic.",1
DOROTHY: No Blanche she is upset because they keep changing the taste of coke.,"DOROTHY: Honey you alright?
 ROSE: I'll be fine
 BLANCHE: Is this about Arnie?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly negative. the phrase ""she is upset"" indicates a negative emotion, but the rest of the sentence is factual in tone.

step 2: this sentence is likely from a conversation or script, given the name ""dorothy"" at the beginning. the true intention seems to be humor or sarcasm. the idea that someone would be genuinely upset about changes to the taste of coca-cola is exaggerated and somewhat absurd.

step 3: comparing the neutral surface sentiment with the likely humorous intention, we can infer that this statement is meant to be sarcastic. it's using an over-the-top reason (changing the taste of coke) to explain someone's upset state, which is a common sarcastic technique.

### label: sarcastic",1
"DOROTHY: No Rose, she is depressed because Marvel had manners on only once a week","DOROTHY: Now PERSON is depressed Rose.
 ROSE: Do you think she is depressed about Rebecca
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context requires some careful consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative or neutral. the key phrase ""she is depressed"" indicates a negative emotional state. there are no overtly positive words or phrases, and no emojis to consider.

step 2: true intention
this sentence seems to be part of a dialogue, with dorothy responding to rose. the true intention appears to be humorous or nonsensical rather than a genuine statement about depression. the phrase ""marvel had manners on only once a week"" doesn't make logical sense in the context of causing depression, which suggests it's not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface negative sentiment with the nonsensical explanation for depression, there's a clear mismatch. this mismatch is characteristic of sarcasm, where the literal meaning differs from the intended meaning. the absurdity of the statement about ""marvel having manners on"" as a cause of depression is likely meant to be humorous and not taken seriously.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses an absurd, illogical explanation for depression to create a humorous effect, which is a common sarcastic technique.",1

 DOROTHY: Oh you're sure I am
 ROSE: Are you nervous cause you haven't met Michael's fiancee?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll break this down step-by-step to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of genuine nervousness or concern about sonny bono's election as mayor and its potential consequences.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually to make a joke or humorous comment. the speaker is using exaggeration and absurdity to create a comedic effect. the idea of a mayor forcing postal workers to wear ""leather bell bottoms and a fur vest"" is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems to express worry, the content of the statement is clearly not meant to be taken literally. the exaggeration and absurdity of the imagined scenario indicate that this is a sarcastic comment, likely poking fun at sonny bono's background in entertainment and fashion, as well as perhaps mocking the idea that his election would lead to any significant changes.

the disconnect between the seemingly serious tone and the ridiculous content is a classic indicator of sarcasm. therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic.",1
"DOROTHY: Oh yes Blanche, about a half hour ago. But now I have hidden her again so you can find her.","BLANCHE: Have you found her?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"to properly analyze this input, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and helpful. dorothy is saying she hid something (presumably a person) so that blanche can find her, which on the surface seems like a kind gesture to set up a game or surprise.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention becomes clearer. the statement is illogical and contradictory. dorothy claims to have hidden someone so that blanche can find her, which doesn't make sense. hiding someone typically prevents them from being found, not facilitates it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contradiction between the surface-level helpful tone and the illogical content of the statement strongly suggests sarcasm. dorothy is likely mocking blanche's search efforts or pointing out the absurdity of the situation in a sardonic way.

### label: sarcastic

the statement employs verbal irony by saying one thing but meaning the opposite, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the contradiction between hiding someone and wanting them to be found is the key indicator of the sarcastic intent.",1
"DOROTHY: I don't know Rose, maybe Marry Poppins has an Italian cousin.","ROSE: Isn't she happy here?
 DOROTHY: I think she will be happy with Gloria
 ROSE: What about us? Whose gonna keep after us. Make us linguini and tell us story about Cicily.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly skeptical. dorothy is expressing uncertainty (""i don't know"") and proposing a hypothetical situation about mary poppins having an italian cousin.

step 2: true intention:
the true intention appears to be sarcastic. the idea of mary poppins, a quintessentially british character, having an italian cousin is absurd and likely not meant to be taken seriously. this statement is probably in response to someone (possibly rose) suggesting something equally unlikely or far-fetched.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the content of the statement is deliberately ridiculous. the contrast between the calm delivery (""i don't know rose, maybe..."") and the absurd suggestion creates a sarcastic tone. dorothy is likely using this statement to humorously dismiss or mock whatever idea rose had previously proposed.

 BLANCHE: I guess you are still upset with me about last night aren't you?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"since this sentence is quite unusual and doesn't have clear indicators of sarcasm, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative or upset. the speaker, dorothy, explicitly states she is ""upset"" about something related to ""crocodin turbs"" wearing darker colors.

step 2: true intention
this sentence doesn't seem to have a clear true intention beyond its literal meaning. the topic (crocodin turbs wearing darker colors) is nonsensical and doesn't relate to any real-world issue or common complaint. it appears to be a random, absurd statement.

step 3: compare and analyze
there's no clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and a deeper meaning. the statement is simply bizarre and doesn't seem to be making any kind of point through sarcasm or irony. it's more likely to be a nonsensical statement or part of some surreal or absurdist dialogue.

given this analysis, i don't believe this statement is sarcastic. it's strange and nonsensical, but not sarcastic in the traditional sense.

DOROTHY: The liberarche marquee at Caesar's palace,"DOROTHY: Whop, it is really coming down.
 ROSE: Whats coming down?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as the context and intention aren't immediately clear to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. the sentence appears to be a simple statement about a marquee at caesar's palace, mentioning liberace (assuming ""liberarche"" is a typo for ""liberace""). there are no obvious emotional keywords or phrases, and no emojis or other sentiment indicators.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is not entirely clear without more context. however, mentioning liberace and caesar's palace together could be seen as a commentary on the flamboyant, over-the-top nature of las vegas entertainment. liberace was known for his extravagant performances, which aligns with the image of caesar's palace as a grandiose casino.

step 3: compare and analyze
while there's no obvious contradiction between the surface sentiment and the possible deeper meaning, there's also no clear indication of sarcasm. the statement appears to be a straightforward observation or comment about a real feature at caesar's palace.

given the lack of clear sarcastic elements or contradictions between surface and deeper meanings, i would conclude:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that without more context, it's difficult to be entirely certain. the statement could potentially be part of a larger sarcastic conversation, but based solely on this single line, there's not enough evidence to classify it as sarcastic.",0
"DOROTHY: No, she is going to sit here where itÕs a 112 degrees and eat enchiladas.","DOROTHY: Its Miami in June, only cats are wearing fur!
 ROSE: You going out?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll break down the reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be stating a literal action - someone sitting in extreme heat eating enchiladas. the temperature of 112 degrees is notably high, which is a key detail.

step 2: the true intention is to mock or criticize the idea that someone would actually do this. it's using hyperbole (exaggeration) to emphasize how ridiculous or unlikely the described scenario is.

step 3: the surface meaning (step 1) is clearly at odds with the true intention (step 2). the statement is meant to be taken as the opposite of its literal meaning, which is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the extreme temperature and the specific food choice (enchiladas) add to the sarcastic tone, making it clear that this is not a serious suggestion or description of events.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic.",1
"DOROTHY: No, its because I cannot make any sense of those commercials for obsession.","DOROTHY: Sorry I snapped at your Rose. It's just that I am upset, I am very upset.
 ROSE: Is it because you threw Michael out?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. dorothy expresses inability to understand something (""i cannot make any sense of""). there are no overtly positive or negative keywords, emojis, or sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a straightforward statement of confusion or criticism about commercials for a product called ""obsession"" (likely a perfume). there's no apparent use of rhetorical devices or unusual language style that would suggest a hidden meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. dorothy is directly stating her inability to understand certain commercials. there's no discrepancy between what's said and what's meant, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of confusion or criticism without any sarcastic undertones.",0
"DOROTHY: No, I am depressed becaues Phillis George left the morning news.","ROSE: Are you depressed about Glen?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the use of the word ""depressed."" dorothy explicitly states she is feeling down because of phyllis george leaving the morning news.

step 2: true intention
this statement seems to be genuine rather than sarcastic. there's no obvious exaggeration, irony, or mismatch between the stated reason and the emotion. it's plausible that someone could feel sad about a favorite news anchor leaving a show.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the likely true intention. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as hyperbole, unexpected contrasts, or context that would make this statement absurd or humorous. the straightforward expression of a negative emotion for a relatively minor reason appears sincere, albeit perhaps a bit dramatic.

"DOROTHY: No Blanche, with a venus fly trap","DOROTHY: Morning everybody, Rose honey I hope you don't mind, I borrowed your golf club, I have a date to play this morning.
 BLANCHE: With a man?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't immediately clear:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no clearly positive or negative words, emojis, or phrases. it's a simple statement mentioning dorothy, blanche, and a venus fly trap.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. however, the phrase ""no blanche, with a venus fly trap"" suggests this might be a response to a question or statement, potentially correcting or contradicting blanche about something involving a venus fly trap. the abruptness and specificity of mentioning a venus fly trap in what seems to be a conversation between two people (dorothy and blanche) hints at potential sarcasm or humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the unusual nature of the statement and the potential context of a conversation make it possible that this could be a sarcastic response. however, without more context, it's difficult to be certain.

given the limited information and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i'm inclined to err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification has low confidence due to the lack of context. with more information about the conversation or the relationship between dorothy and blanche, a different classification might be possible.",0
"DOROTHY: No Rose, go to the corner and open a stand","ROSE: Shall I set this down someplace?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the sentence is a directive, telling rose to go to a corner and open a stand, which doesn't immediately suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
considering the context and the unusual nature of the directive, it's likely that dorothy is not actually suggesting rose should open a stand in the corner. this seems to be a dismissive or mocking response to something rose might have said or suggested earlier.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface level instruction doesn't match with what would typically be a reasonable suggestion in most contexts. the incongruity between the literal meaning and the likely intended meaning suggests sarcasm. dorothy is probably using this statement to humorously or sarcastically dismiss an idea or suggestion from rose.

### label: sarcastic

the mismatch between the literal instruction and the likely intended meaning, along with the absurdity of actually suggesting someone open a stand in a corner, strongly indicates that this statement is sarcastic.",1
DOROTHY: Lords of Arabia,"DOROTHY: Well ofcourse Blanche , they did it in that movie.
 ROSE: What movie?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"given the short input ""dorothy: lords of arabia"" without much context, i don't have 90% confidence in making an immediate judgment about whether it's sarcastic or not. let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase doesn't contain obvious sentiment keywords, emotional phrases, or emojis. it's a neutral statement mentioning ""dorothy"" and ""lords of arabia"".

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or rhetorical device at play. the juxtaposition of ""dorothy"" (a typically western name) with ""lords of arabia"" could potentially be meant ironically, but it's not certain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't enough information to confidently detect sarcasm. the statement could be a straightforward title or reference, or it could be an ironic comment depending on the broader context.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and insufficient context, i'm inclined to err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification has low confidence due to the limited information provided.",0
DOROTHY: No I am worried she might be Phir Resuda's,"DOROTHY: Just keep thinking about Ma and whose mother she really is.
 ROSE: You worried she might be Gina's?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"in this case, i'll think through the steps as the context and intent are not immediately clear to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of concern or worry. the key phrase ""i am worried"" directly expresses a negative emotion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. dorothy is expressing genuine concern about someone (likely a ""she"" mentioned earlier in the conversation) potentially being ""phir resuda's"". without more context, it's difficult to determine what ""phir resuda's"" refers to, but it seems to be something dorothy perceives as negative or worrying.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement seems to be a straightforward expression of worry without any indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or unexpected humor.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of concern without any sarcastic elements.",0
"DOROTHY: Oh ma no, it was a little girl selling girl scout toilets.","DOROTHY: Oh fine we will!
 SOPHIA: Is that Paolo?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the statement is unusual and requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly confused. the phrase ""oh ma no"" could indicate surprise or mild dismay. there are no strongly positive or negative words, emojis, or clear sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is likely humorous. the phrase ""girl scout toilets"" is nonsensical and appears to be a deliberate mistake or play on words, likely referring to ""girl scout cookies"" which is a common fundraising activity. this unexpected twist suggests the speaker is intentionally saying something absurd for comedic effect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention appears to be humorous through the use of an absurd substitution (toilets instead of cookies). this deliberate misstatement for comedic effect is a common sarcastic technique.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the unexpected and absurd nature of ""girl scout toilets"" in place of the expected ""girl scout cookies"" is a clear indicator of sarcastic humor in this context.",1
"DOROTHY: No, I haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.","PERSON: Sophia was discharged, is she here?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the statement is matter-of-fact, but the content (keeping someone in a car trunk) is alarming if taken literally.

step 2: true intention
this statement is likely not meant to be taken literally. it's probably a response to a question about someone (possibly a pet or a child) that dorothy was supposed to take somewhere. the exaggerated response of keeping someone in a car trunk is likely meant to be humorous or to express frustration at being asked about something she hasn't done yet.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention appears to be using hyperbole for comedic effect or to express annoyance. the contrast between the casual tone and the extreme content (leaving someone in a car trunk) creates a sarcastic effect.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
"DOROTHY: Rose, you should sit here and watch her hack herself to death","DOROTHY: ma I think you should sit down
 ROSE: Dorothy, should I get Sophia a glass of water?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and callous. the phrase ""watch her hack herself to death"" is quite harsh and seemingly uncaring.

step 2: true intention
considering this is a line from dorothy, likely referring to the tv show ""the golden girls,"" we need to consider the context and character. dorothy often uses dry humor and sarcasm. the exaggerated nature of the statement (""hack herself to death"") and the casual suggestion to watch such a thing indicates this is not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is negative and shocking, but the true intention is likely to humorously express concern or frustration about someone's persistent coughing (assuming ""hack"" refers to coughing). the exaggeration and casual tone about a serious matter (someone potentially dying) is a classic marker of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1
"DOROTHY: Ofcourse no Ma, I am referring to Carrey Grant, he is living in the broom closet.","DOROTHY: Supposed to study for my French final with a fourteen year old in the house, its hard enough with an eighty year old.
 SOPHIA: Are you referring to me?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be matter-of-fact. dorothy is seemingly stating that cary grant is living in the broom closet. the phrase ""of course"" suggests certainty.

step 2: the true intention of this statement is likely not literal. it's highly improbable that a famous actor like cary grant would be living in a broom closet. the use of an absurd scenario (a celebrity living in a closet) and the exaggerated certainty (""of course"") are indicators of sarcasm.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (a straightforward statement) with the likely true intention (an absurd, impossible scenario presented as fact), we can infer that this statement is sarcastic. dorothy is likely responding to a question or statement from her mother with an exaggerated, impossible scenario to express frustration or ridicule.

### label: sarcastic",1
"DOROTHY: How about stopping by new years eve with three naked women, throwing up in the pool, passing out in the punch bowl, and relieving yourself in the linen closet?","DOROTHY: We thought you might like to join us for dinner?
 SOPHIA: I get the feeling Dorothy that you might be a little mad at me. Why is that?
",GOLDENGIRLS,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be jovial or celebratory, as it describes activities associated with a wild new year's eve party. however, the description includes extreme and inappropriate behaviors that would typically be seen as negative or problematic.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is likely to be critical or disapproving. dorothy is probably not actually suggesting or endorsing these behaviors. instead, she seems to be using exaggeration and shock value to make a point about inappropriate or excessive party behavior.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between the seemingly casual suggestion of these extreme party activities and the likely disapproval of such behavior indicates sarcasm. dorothy is using irony to emphasize how outrageous and unacceptable these actions would be, rather than genuinely proposing them.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

"DOROTHY: No Rose, at a pie eating contest.","DOROTHY: Oh I am so nervous. Have you ever given an eulogy?
 ROSE: You mean at a funeral?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis. it's a simple statement mentioning a pie eating contest.

step 2: true intention
this sentence appears to be a response to an unspoken question or statement. the ""no rose"" at the beginning suggests that dorothy is correcting or contradicting something rose said or implied. the mention of a pie eating contest seems out of context and unexpected, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the unexpected nature of the response and the context (correcting someone) suggests that this is likely a sarcastic comment. dorothy is probably not literally talking about a pie eating contest, but using it as a sarcastic response to something rose said or did.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the unexpected reference to a pie eating contest in what seems to be a correction or response to another person strongly indicates sarcastic intent.",1
DOROTHY: To feed the cat Rose.,"DOROTHY: Your kidney?
 BLANCHE: My kidney.

i'm outputting this result directly because the given statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the sentence ""to feed the cat rose"" seems to be a simple answer to an implied question about dorothy's intention or action. there are no apparent cues or context that would suggest sarcasm in this brief statement. it reads as a plain, literal response about the task of feeding a cat named rose.",0
DOROTHY: Show them your slides of Hawaii,"ROSE: Wait donÕt leave me, what will I do if they come back?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"### label: not sarcastic

this sentence appears to be a straightforward request or suggestion without any apparent sarcastic elements. dorothy is simply asking someone to show their slides of hawaii, likely in a casual or friendly context. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems to be meant literally and sincerely, so it can be classified as not sarcastic.",0
DOROTHY: No I am upset because Joe Piscapo didn't get the lead role in rain man.,"DOROTHY: No rose.
 ROSE: Are you upset because Blanche is going to sell the house and we can't live together.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. dorothy says she is ""upset,"" which indicates a negative emotion.

step 2: true intention
this sentence is likely not meant to be taken at face value. several factors suggest this:
1. joe piscopo is a comedian and actor, not typically associated with dramatic roles like ""rain man.""
2. ""rain man"" is a well-known film starring dustin hoffman and tom cruise, released in 1988.
3. it's highly unlikely that someone would genuinely be upset about joe piscopo not getting this role, especially given the time that has passed since the movie's release.

the true intention seems to be making a joke or absurd statement, rather than expressing genuine upset.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (being upset) contrasts sharply with the likely true intention (making a joke). this mismatch between the stated emotion and the absurd reason given for it is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a deadpan delivery of an absurd idea (being upset about joe piscopo not starring in rain man) to create a sarcastic effect. the speaker is not truly upset, but rather using this statement to make a humorous point or perhaps mock the idea of being upset over trivial matters in the entertainment industry.",1
DOROTHY: A bucket of chicked. I hope you like it extra flat and crispy,"ROSE: We brought dinner.
 SOPHIA: What you get?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive at first glance. ""i hope you like it"" is typically a phrase used when offering something pleasant. however, the description of the chicken as ""extra flat and crispy"" is unusual and potentially negative.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here appears to be quite different from the surface sentiment. the phrase ""bucket of chicken"" usually implies a meal from a fast-food restaurant, which wouldn't typically be ""extra flat."" this description suggests the chicken has been run over or severely crushed, making it inedible. the speaker is likely pointing out the poor state of the food in a humorous way.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of hoping someone likes the food is contradicted by the description of the food as essentially ruined. this stark contrast between the seemingly positive offering and the clearly unappetizing description of the food is a classic structure for sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to highlight the poor quality of the meal.

### label: sarcastic",1
DOROTHY: It's a musical Rose,"ROSE: What kind of a movie is this Dorothy?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment. dorothy is likely explaining to rose that something they're discussing or watching is a musical. there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm in this short, simple statement. the context suggests it's probably part of a conversation where dorothy is providing information to rose about the nature of a performance or show.",0
DOROTHY: I'm worried about whether Michael Jackson will be able to buy the remains of the elephant man.,"BLANCHE: Still worried about the money you owe the government?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the situation requires some analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of genuine concern. the phrase ""i'm worried about"" indicates anxiety or apprehension about the situation described.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention of this statement is likely not genuine worry. the subject matter - michael jackson buying the remains of the elephant man - is so bizarre and trivial in the grand scheme of things that it's unlikely to be a real concern for most people. this juxtaposition of expressed worry with an absurd situation suggests the speaker is not being sincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the mismatch between the expressed worry and the trivial, strange nature of the concern indicates that this statement is likely meant to be humorous or satirical. the speaker is probably mocking either michael jackson's eccentricities or the media's obsession with celebrity news.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses the pretense of worry about an absurd situation to create a sarcastic commentary, likely on celebrity culture or media priorities.",1
DOROTHY: His cappucino maker.,"DOROTHY: The only thing we have in common is under the sheets
 ROSE: Whats under the sheets?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"given the limited context provided in this single line of dialogue, i don't have enough information to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. ""his cappuccino maker"" is a simple statement about possession of an object, without any obvious emotional keywords or sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention behind this statement. it could be:
- a straightforward answer to a question about what someone owns
- part of a larger conversation where the cappuccino maker is significant in some way
- potentially sarcastic if, for example, the cappuccino maker is being mentioned as an unexpectedly trivial or inappropriate item in a given context

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the absence of clear sarcastic markers (such as exaggeration, irony, or contrast), there isn't enough information to confidently label this as sarcastic. the statement on its own appears to be a neutral, factual comment.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification is made with low confidence due to the lack of context. in a broader conversation or with more information, this statement could potentially be part of a sarcastic exchange.",0
"DOROTHY: No, she I supset because Jimmy Swaager can't cover his motel bill","ROSE: But I am still upset.
 BLANCHE: Are you upset because you don't know what to do about Al?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""can't cover his motel bill"" suggests financial difficulty, which is generally seen as a negative situation.

step 2: true intention
this sentence seems to be referencing jimmy swaggart, a televangelist who was involved in a scandal involving a prostitute in a motel. the speaker is likely making a joke or sarcastic comment about this scandal, using the euphemism of ""can't cover his motel bill"" to refer to swaggart's moral and financial fall from grace.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment appears straightforward, the true intention is to make a wry or sarcastic comment about a public figure's scandal. the use of ""can't cover his motel bill"" is likely a deliberate understatement of the actual situation, which is a common technique in sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the speaker is using sarcasm to comment on jimmy swaggart's scandal, employing understatement and implied meaning to create a humorous effect.",1
DOROTHY: No itÕs the rose in the kitchen thing.,"DOROTHY: She is miserable.
 ROSE: Just to keep me upto speed Dorothy, it is this negligent arson that prospect of spending the rest of her wiening years in jail thing right?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the context isn't immediately clear to me:

step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence doesn't contain any obvious sentimental keywords, phrases, or emojis. it's a neutral statement referring to ""the rose in the kitchen thing.""

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or rhetorical device being used. the statement seems straightforward, possibly responding to a previous question or comment about something in the kitchen.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the neutral, matter-of-fact nature of the statement, there doesn't appear to be any sarcasm present. the sentence doesn't exhibit typical sarcastic features like exaggeration, irony, or a mismatch between surface meaning and true intention.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a simple, non-sarcastic response in a conversation. however, it's important to note that sarcasm can sometimes be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the surrounding conversation, we can't be 100% certain.",0
"DOROTHY: In what Blanche, dog years?","DOROTHY: Was there ever any doubt?
 BLANCHE: Momentarily. This is strictly off the record, but Dirk's nearly five years younger that I.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly confused. the question ""in what blanche, dog years?"" doesn't contain obviously sentimental words or phrases. it appears to be a simple query about a timeframe, with the unusual addition of ""dog years.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be sarcastic or mocking. the phrase ""dog years"" is typically used to exaggerate age, implying something or someone is older than they appear. by asking if blanche is measuring time in ""dog years,"" dorothy is likely implying that blanche is exaggerating or misrepresenting her age to appear younger.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention reveals a sarcastic tone. the use of ""dog years"" in this context is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a jab at blanche's perceived dishonesty about her age. this discrepancy between the surface question and the implied criticism is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using the concept of ""dog years"" to humorously criticize or mock blanche's representation of her age.",1

 DOROTHY: Yes
 ROSE: How did they know its Spanish?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"to properly classify this statement, i'll need to analyze it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""little sunbrella"" could be seen as cute or endearing.

step 2: true intention
this sentence seems to be a response to a question, likely ""why does x wear y?"" the answer provided is playful and appears to be a pun or wordplay. ""sunbrella"" is likely a combination of ""sun"" and ""umbrella,"" creating a whimsical, made-up term.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, there doesn't appear to be any contradiction or hidden negative meaning. the statement seems to be a straightforward, albeit playful, response to a question. it's using wordplay for humor, but not in a way that's meant to mock or criticize.

### label: not sarcastic

DOROTHY: What was I doing? My ben gazara in person?,"SOPHIA: Probably just misses her mother.
 SOPHIA: It needs to hear a feminine voice.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step since the context isn't immediately clear to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is unclear. there are no obvious sentimental keywords, phrases, or emojis. the sentence appears to be a question, but it's somewhat confusing due to the mention of ""ben gazara in person"" which doesn't follow standard sentence structure.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is difficult to discern without more context. however, the phrase ""my ben gazara in person?"" seems to be a reference to the actor ben gazzara. the unusual phrasing suggests that dorothy might be expressing surprise or disbelief about something, possibly related to seeing ben gazzara or someone who reminds her of him.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention that would indicate sarcasm. the statement seems more confused or surprised than sarcastic. without more context or a clear indicator of irony or mocking tone, it's difficult to classify this as sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's some ambiguity due to the lack of context, the statement doesn't appear to have the typical markers of sarcasm such as obvious irony, exaggeration, or a mocking tone. it seems more likely to be a genuine, if confusingly worded, question or expression of surprise.",0

 DOROTHY: You couldn't get it open?
 BLANCHE: Oh I didn't try. I don't wanna risk cracking a nail.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the context isn't entirely clear and sarcasm often requires more information.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly curious. dorothy is asking a question about something she's observing, specifically inquiring if certain objects are claws. there are no obvious sentimental words or phrases, and no emojis. the tone seems straightforward and inquisitive.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden intention behind this question. however, in many scenarios, asking ""what are these? claws?"" could be a genuine question of curiosity or surprise. there's no clear indication of rhetorical devices or a particular language style that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the potential true intention, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the question seems to be a straightforward inquiry about identifying something unfamiliar.

given this analysis, i would conclude:

### label: not sarcastic

this classification is based on the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the apparently straightforward nature of the question. however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and with additional information about the situation or dorothy's tone, this interpretation could potentially change.",0
"DOROTHY: The little man who lives in there, who turns the light on and off will tell you.","ROSE: How would I know if they fog up?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly positive. dorothy is providing an explanation about someone who can help, which on the surface seems helpful and informative.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is likely humorous or sarcastic. the idea of a ""little man"" living inside something (presumably a lamp or light fixture) who controls the light is clearly not meant to be taken literally. this is an absurd explanation that's likely meant to be funny or to mock the idea of simple explanations for complex things.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface-level helpfulness with the absurd content, we can infer that this statement is meant to be humorous and not sincere. the contrast between the matter-of-fact delivery and the ridiculous content is a classic setup for sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

this statement uses a deadpan delivery of an absurd idea, which is a common form of sarcasm. the speaker is not seriously suggesting that there's a little man controlling the light, but rather using this ridiculous image to make a point or simply to be funny.",1
"DOROTHY: No Rose, I am developing pictures from the magellan space probe","ROSE: Hi Dorothy, cooking?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"i believe i can confidently classify this input, so i'll provide the label directly:

### label: sarcastic

this response from dorothy is clearly sarcastic. the context suggests she's likely responding to a question or comment from rose with an absurdly exaggerated and obviously false statement. the reference to ""developing pictures from the magellan space probe"" is so out of place in what we can assume is a normal conversation that it's clearly meant as a sarcastic retort, likely to point out the obviousness or silliness of whatever rose had said or asked previously.",1
"DOROTHY: No Rose, it stands alone.","PERSON: What are you seeing?
 BLANCHE: Nightmare on Elm Street 4
 ROSE: Do you have to see 1, 2 and 3 to appreciate it?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"given the limited context provided in this single line of dialogue, i don't have enough information to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. therefore, i'll think through it step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis. it's a simple declarative statement.

step 2: true intention
without more context about the conversation or the characters involved, it's difficult to deduce the true intention behind this statement. ""it stands alone"" could be meant literally or figuratively, and the tone could vary greatly depending on the broader context and how it's delivered.

step 3: comparison and analysis
due to the lack of context and the ambiguity of the statement, i can't confidently determine if there's a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention, which would be indicative of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i don't have enough information to reliably classify this statement as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. however, if forced to choose based on the limited information available, i would lean towards:

### label: not sarcastic

this is because the statement appears straightforward and there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. however, i want to emphasize that this classification has low confidence due to the lack of context.",0
DOROTHY: A hand puppet Rose.,"PERSON: So you have replaced me.
 ROSE: With what?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

this sentence appears to be a simple, straightforward statement from a character named dorothy describing an object - a hand puppet - belonging to or associated with rose. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the statement is brief and factual in nature, lacking any apparent emotional tone or hidden meaning that might suggest sarcasm.

in the context of what seems to be a script or dialogue, this line is likely just providing information or setting a scene. without additional context or tone indicators, there's no reason to interpret this as anything other than a literal statement.

therefore, i classify this statement as ""not sarcastic"".",0
"DOROTHY: No Rose, that you should do.","ROSE: No more ice-skating
 ROSE: And I am not gonna go Niagra falls in a barrel.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"to properly analyze this input for sarcasm, i'll need to think through it step-by-step, as the context isn't entirely clear from this short line alone.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. dorothy is affirming something that rose should do, which on its face seems like straightforward encouragement or agreement.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or true intention that differs from the surface sentiment. the phrase ""that you should do"" could potentially be read with different tones or implications depending on the broader conversation and relationship between dorothy and rose.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information, there's no clear evidence of sarcasm. the statement appears to be a straightforward affirmation or suggestion. while sarcasm is possible depending on tone and context not provided here, we don't have enough information to confidently label this as sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" as the label because there isn't enough context or clear indicators of sarcasm in this short statement. without additional information about tone, body language, or the broader conversation, it's safest to interpret this as a non-sarcastic comment.",0
MEMBER-GIRL: Amazing.,"MODERATOR: Hello everybody! How was your week?
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"given the very limited context of a single word ""amazing."" without any additional information, tone indicators, or surrounding context, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether this is sarcastic or not. therefore, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment is clearly positive. ""amazing"" is a strongly positive word expressing admiration or astonishment.

step 2: without more context, it's challenging to deduce the true intention. ""amazing"" could be genuinely meant, or it could be used sarcastically to express the opposite sentiment. the period at the end could potentially indicate a flat or deadpan delivery, which might hint at sarcasm, but this is not conclusive.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we have a positive surface sentiment, but insufficient information to confidently determine if it's genuine or sarcastic. in many cases, such a short, one-word response could be used sarcastically, especially in online communication. however, it could just as easily be a genuine expression of amazement.

given the lack of context and the ambiguity, i cannot confidently classify this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. if forced to make a decision, i would lean slightly towards ""not sarcastic"" as that's the literal meaning, but my confidence in this classification would be low.

 MODERATOR: Perhaps you would like to introduce yourself?
 SCOTT: Hi everybody, my name is Scott and I am a sarcasmholic.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"### label: not sarcastic

this short exclamation ""nooo"" doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward expression of dismay, disagreement, or disappointment. without additional context or cues that might suggest a sarcastic tone, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a genuine, non-sarcastic utterance.",0
MODERATOR: Well scott I am sure we are all really really looking forward to hear your story.,"SCOTT: I finally got to admit it to myself. I have got a sarcasm problem.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""really really looking forward"" and ""sure we are all"" indicate enthusiasm and eagerness to hear scott's story.

step 2: true intention
however, the exaggerated use of ""really really"" and the formal tone of a moderator hint at potential insincerity. moderators often use polite language regardless of their true feelings. the overstated enthusiasm seems forced, potentially masking disinterest or even dread about hearing scott's story.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the overly enthusiastic surface sentiment and the likely true intention of polite obligation or even reluctance suggests sarcasm. the moderator is likely using exaggerated positive language to mask their true feelings, which is a common sarcastic technique.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
MODERATOR: Sarcasm? Noo.,"SCOTT: Sorry, was that sarcasm?
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the word ""noo"" seems to be denying the presence of sarcasm.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we consider a few factors:
1. the exaggerated spelling of ""noo"" with an extra 'o' is often used to convey a sarcastic tone.
2. the fact that this is labeled as coming from a ""moderator"" adds context - moderators are often tasked with identifying or managing sarcasm in discussions.
3. the very act of questioning sarcasm in this short, pointed way is itself often a sarcastic device.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (denial of sarcasm) with the likely true intention (ironically pointing out sarcasm), we can conclude that this statement is, in fact, sarcastic. the moderator is using sarcasm to comment on sarcasm itself, creating a meta-sarcastic statement.

therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1
"MODERATOR: No, no no, I just mediate the gorup. I just give up every Tuesday of my life to help these screwups for the good of my health","SCOTT: Sarcasmholic yourself?
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. key phrases like ""i just mediate the group"" and ""for the good of my health"" suggest a selfless, beneficial activity. the speaker seems to be portraying themselves as a dedicated volunteer.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, several clues indicate a different intention:
- ""no, no no"" - emphatic denial suggests frustration
- ""give up every tuesday of my life"" - implies sacrifice and resentment
- ""help these screwups"" - negative characterization of group members
- ""for the good of my health"" - unlikely to be literal; health usually suffers from stress

the true intention seems to be expressing frustration and resentment about a thankless, time-consuming volunteer role.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of selfless volunteering sharply contrasts with the underlying frustration and resentment. the speaker is using exaggeration and false positivity to highlight their dissatisfaction. this mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using exaggerated positive framing to express negative feelings about a volunteer role.",1
MEMBER-GIRL: Really?,"SCOTT: He doesn't need to be sarcastic. I mean, that was sarcasm wasn't it?
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"for this short input, i'll provide a direct response as the context is quite limited.

### label: not sarcastic

the single word ""really?"" by itself doesn't provide enough context to confidently classify it as sarcastic. while ""really?"" can sometimes be used sarcastically, it's also commonly used to express genuine surprise, seek confirmation, or show interest. without additional context or tone indicators, it's safer to classify this as not sarcastic. the default interpretation of ""really?"" is typically a genuine question or expression of surprise rather than sarcasm.",0
MEMBER-GIRL: Sarcasm? At a sarcasmoholics meeting?,"SCOTT: Alright! Definitely!
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

this statement is clearly sarcastic. the speaker is using rhetorical irony by expressing mock surprise at the presence of sarcasm at a ""sarcasmoholics meeting."" the very concept of a ""sarcasmoholics meeting"" is itself a joke, implying a support group for people addicted to sarcasm. 

the rhetorical question format (""sarcasm? at a sarcasmoholics meeting?"") is a classic sarcastic structure, where the speaker is pretending to be shocked by something that is entirely expected or obvious. the implication is that of course there would be sarcasm at such a meeting - that's the whole point.

this statement is employing sarcasm to humorously point out the absurdity of being surprised by sarcasm in a context explicitly devoted to sarcasm.",1
MEMBER-BOY: You got off to a really good start with the group.,"SCOTT: It was being sarcastic, alright I see I see
 SCOTT: I didn't realise the sarcasm was going to be so full on. I ll just stand back and start again
 MEMBER-BOY: Oh, we wouldn't bother.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""really good start"" is clearly positive, suggesting praise or approval for how someone began their involvement with a group.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, there's no clear indication that the true intention differs from the surface sentiment. the statement seems straightforward and sincere. there are no obvious rhetorical devices or unusual language styles that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. the statement comes across as a genuine compliment about someone's initial performance or integration into a group.

### label: not sarcastic

i believe this statement is sincere rather than sarcastic. it's a straightforward compliment without any indicators of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
MEMBER-GIRL: We thought you were just here for the company. He is a sarcasmoholic Stewart.,"SCOTT: My name's Scott and I am a sarcasmholic.
 MEMBER-GIRL: Nooo.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""we thought you were just here for the company"" could be interpreted as a friendly or welcoming statement. the second sentence is more factual, stating that ""he is a sarcasmoholic stewart.""

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be different from the surface sentiment:
1. the first sentence ""we thought you were just here for the company"" implies that the person's presence might have had a different, possibly less innocent purpose.
2. the term ""sarcasmoholic"" is a made-up word combining ""sarcasm"" and ""alcoholic,"" suggesting an addiction to sarcasm.
3. the juxtaposition of these two sentences suggests that the first sentence is likely not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention don't align. the seemingly friendly first sentence is undermined by the second sentence's implication of excessive sarcasm. this mismatch, combined with the explicit mention of sarcasm (via ""sarcasmoholic""), strongly indicates that the entire statement is meant to be sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is classified as sarcastic due to the intentional mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention, as well as the explicit reference to sarcasm itself.",1
MEMBER-BOY: Noooo. Really?,"SCOTT: I am having a bit of trouble telling when people are sarcastic.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be surprise or disbelief, indicated by the exaggerated ""noooo"" and the question ""really?""

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely not genuine surprise or disbelief. the exaggerated ""noooo"" and the short, emphatic ""really?"" suggest that the speaker is not actually seeking confirmation or expressing genuine shock. instead, it implies that the information being responded to is obvious or already well-known.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of surprise contrasts with the likely true intention of expressing that something is obvious or already known. this mismatch between the apparent meaning and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm. the exaggerated response to what is likely common knowledge or an obvious statement further supports this interpretation.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that this short exchange exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm, where the speaker's words convey the opposite of their true feelings or beliefs.",1
MODERATOR: Nooo!,"SCOTT: It was quite hard .. Was just being sarcastic!
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"given the extremely limited context of just ""moderator: nooo!"", i don't have enough information to confidently classify this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the exclamation could be genuine distress or it could be exaggerated for sarcastic effect. without more context about the situation or conversation, i can't make a reliable judgment. therefore, i would need to say:

### label: not enough context to determine",0
MODERATOR: Sarcastic? Us? Nooo.,"SCOTT: No seriouslty.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and sincere, with the word ""nooo"" seemingly denying any accusation of sarcasm.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we consider:
- the context of a moderator speaking
- the exaggerated ""nooo"" with multiple 'o's
- the rhetorical question ""us?""
- the overall brevity and casual tone

step 3: comparing the surface denial with the underlying tone, it's clear this is a playful, self-aware admission of sarcasm. the moderator is ironically using sarcasm to respond to an implied accusation of sarcasm, essentially confirming the very thing they're denying.

this multi-layered irony makes it a textbook example of sarcasm, hence the ""sarcastic"" label.",1
MODERATOR: And I am sure every person here really really wants you to join our group.,"MODERATOR: Scott scott come back. You have to realize that we are a bunch of people with severe problems.
 MODERATOR: We have been trying to help ourselves, just like you have been trying to help yourself.
 MODERATOR: That's why we need to help each other.
 MODERATOR: I mean, you seem like a decent guy.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- use of ""sure"" indicating certainty
- repetition of ""really"" for emphasis
- phrase ""wants you to join our group"" suggesting desire and inclusion

step 2: true intention
however, there are some clues that suggest this might not be the true intention:
- the speaker is identified as a ""moderator"", which implies a position of authority or control
- the emphasis on ""every person"" and repeated ""really"" could be seen as exaggeration
- the statement seems unnaturally enthusiastic, which can be a marker of sarcasm

step 3: comparison and analysis
the overly enthusiastic tone from a moderator, combined with the exaggeration, suggests that the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. the moderator may actually be implying that the group doesn't want this person to join, or is at least not as enthusiastic as the words suggest.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
MODERATOR: Noo..,"SCOTT: [nodding] - Was that sarcasm?
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the input is quite brief and context-dependent:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or disappointed, indicated by the word ""noo.."" with the extended ""o"". this typically expresses dismay or disagreement.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm. the ""moderator:"" prefix suggests this is part of a larger conversation or forum discussion. the brevity and ellipsis ("".."" at the end) could indicate trailing off, perhaps implying more than is explicitly stated.

step 3: analysis and inference
given the limited information and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, it's safest to interpret this at face value. the moderator seems to be expressing genuine disagreement or disappointment with something previously said or done.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's not enough context to be 100% certain, the most likely interpretation based on the available information is that this is a sincere expression of disagreement or disappointment, not sarcasm.",0
"CHANDLER: You said you spent all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses and pants. What do you plan on wearing? A Chicken suit?","MONICA: And the boots don't really go with it.
",FRIENDS,1,"label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning or critical. chandler is asking about monica's planned outfit to go with her expensive boots, seemingly in a straightforward manner.

step 2 (true intention):
however, the true intention is to mock or ridicule monica's justification for buying expensive boots. the key here is the absurd suggestion of a ""chicken suit"" as a potential outfit. this is clearly not a serious suggestion, but rather a way to highlight the perceived ridiculousness of monica's reasoning.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
while the surface structure is that of a question, the inclusion of the chicken suit reference transforms this from a genuine inquiry into a sarcastic comment. chandler is using hyperbole and absurdity to satirize monica's justification for her purchase. the contrast between the normal clothing items mentioned (skirts, dresses, pants) and the ridiculous ""chicken suit"" creates the sarcastic tone.

therefore, based on the use of absurd exaggeration to mock someone's reasoning, this statement is clearly sarcastic.",1
"CHANDLER: Oh I am sorry, do you need a break?","MONICA: Oh wait stop! Stop! Stop!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears sympathetic and considerate. chandler is saying ""i am sorry"" and asking if the other person needs a break, which on the surface seems caring and accommodating.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing chandler's character from the tv show friends, and his tendency towards sarcasm, it's likely this isn't sincere. the phrasing ""oh i am sorry"" often introduces a sarcastic statement. the question ""do you need a break?"" might be implying that the other person is being dramatic or overreacting to something.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (caring and accommodating) contrasts with the likely true intention (mocking or belittling). this mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm. chandler is known for his sarcastic comments, which further supports this interpretation.

### label: sarcastic",1
CHANDLER: I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.,"MONICA: Can you give me a closer look so that I can see the price?
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. chandler is talking about seeing something and mentions it will ""cost you one husband,"" which could be interpreted as a straightforward statement about a high price.

step 2: true intention
however, knowing this is chandler from the tv show ""friends,"" we can deduce that this is likely not meant to be taken literally. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. the phrase ""it'll cost you one husband"" is an exaggeration and not a literal price. he's likely making a joke about something being so shocking or surprising that it might cause someone to lose their husband (metaphorically).

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface meaning (step 1) differs significantly from the likely intended meaning (step 2). chandler is using hyperbole and exaggeration for comedic effect, which is a common technique in sarcasm. he's not seriously suggesting that seeing something will actually cost someone their husband; he's using this exaggerated statement to emphasize how notable or shocking the thing in question is.

given chandler's character, the use of exaggeration, and the mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, this statement can be confidently classified as sarcastic.",1
CHANDLER: Well why don't you check in one of my saddle bags while I chew on a bale of hay.,"MONICA: I am sorry I think I can walk the rest of the way now just give me my boots.
 CHANDLER: I don't have your boots
 MONICA: Well I don't have them either, where are they?
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

chandler's statement is clearly sarcastic. the surface meaning suggests he's offering someone to check his ""saddle bags"" while he ""chews on a bale of hay"" - activities associated with horses or other farm animals. however, chandler is obviously not a horse, and this is not meant to be taken literally.

the sarcasm comes from chandler using an exaggerated, absurd comparison to express frustration or annoyance at something (likely a previous statement or request made to him). by sarcastically likening himself to a horse, he's implying that the person he's responding to is treating him like an animal or making unreasonable demands.

this kind of exaggerated, absurd statement that isn't meant to be taken literally is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic humor in the show friends.",1
"CHANDLER: Well, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!","ROSS: Hi Ben, and uh ..
 JOEY: I said ""a little bit"" Ross.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. chandler is describing his job in a straightforward manner, ending with a cheerful greeting ""hi rasputin!""

step 2: true intention
this is clearly not chandler's real job. the description is absurdly specific and politically controversial (connecting soviet scientists with rogue nations). the ""hi rasputin!"" at the end adds to the absurdity, as rasputin was a russian mystic who died long before the soviet era.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface description of an outlandish, illegal job contrasts sharply with the casual, cheerful tone. this stark contrast, combined with the implausibility of the job description and the anachronistic reference to rasputin, clearly indicates that chandler is not being serious. he's using hyperbole and absurdity to create humor, which is a classic form of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
"CHANDLER: Let me think! Let me think! Oh, I don't care.","JOEY: The wheel or pick a Google card.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or dismissive. the phrase ""oh, i don't care"" directly expresses a lack of interest or concern.

step 2: true intention
this line is from the character chandler in the tv show ""friends."" chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. the repetition of ""let me think!"" followed by the abrupt ""oh, i don't care"" suggests a sudden shift that's typical of chandler's sarcastic style. he's likely pretending to consider something seriously before dismissing it entirely, which is a common sarcastic technique.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is straightforward disinterest, the context of chandler's character and the exaggerated way he expresses this (repeating ""let me think!"" before suddenly not caring) strongly suggests that this is not a genuine expression of disinterest, but rather a sarcastic comment meant to be humorous.

### label: sarcastic

the sudden shift from apparent contemplation to dismissal is a classic sarcastic technique, especially coming from a character known for such humor. therefore, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.",1
CHANDLER: The British are coming?,"PHOEBE: Hey you guys, guess what?
",FRIENDS,1,"to accurately classify this input, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly curious. the phrase ""the british are coming?"" is a question, indicating uncertainty or inquiry rather than a clear positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" spoken by the character chandler, who is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. in this context, ""the british are coming?"" is probably not a genuine question about british people arriving. instead, it's likely a response to something unexpected or out of place, using a historical reference (paul revere's famous warning during the american revolution) in a modern, irrelevant context.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment (neutral question) doesn't match the likely true intention (a sarcastic comment about something unexpected). chandler is probably using this historical reference ironically to comment on a current situation, which is a classic form of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment starts positive with ""oh my god i love that!"" which expresses enthusiasm and appreciation.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed in the follow-up exchange. the ""really?"" question and the emphatic ""no!"" response completely contradict the initial positive statement.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we see a clear mismatch between the initial positive expression and the actual negative sentiment. this stark contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm, where someone says the opposite of what they mean for effect.

the structure of saying something positive followed by an immediate and forceful denial is a classic sarcastic format, especially in casual conversation or comedic contexts. this is why i'm confident in classifying this as ""sarcastic.""",1
CHANDLER: No thanks Josephine!,"JOEY: Hey Chandler!, come on in we are knitting pot holders.
",FRIENDS,1,"given the limited context provided, i don't have 90% confidence in making a direct judgment about whether this statement is sarcastic or not. let's analyze it step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be polite refusal. ""no thanks"" is a common phrase used to decline an offer or invitation politely. the use of the name ""josephine"" adds a personal touch, which typically indicates sincerity.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or true intention that differs from the surface sentiment. the name ""josephine"" could be significant if it's not the person's actual name or if there's some backstory we're missing. additionally, this line is attributed to chandler, who is known for his sarcastic personality in the tv show ""friends,"" which could suggest a potential for sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of context and the brevity of the statement, there isn't enough information to confidently determine if this is sarcastic. the surface meaning seems straightforward, but knowing it's chandler speaking introduces the possibility of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

while i can't be 100% certain, i'm leaning towards ""not sarcastic"" because there isn't enough evidence in this short statement to indicate clear sarcasm. without more context or a more obvious contradiction between the surface sentiment and true intention, it's safer to interpret this as a genuine, polite refusal. however, i acknowledge that with more context, especially considering chandler's character, this interpretation could change.",0
"CHANDLER: Oh my god, where are all the men?","CHANDLER: Hey Ross I was wondering.
",FRIENDS,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise and concern, as indicated by the exclamation ""oh my god"" and the question ""where are all the men?""

step 2: true intention
knowing this is a line from chandler in the tv show friends, we need to consider context and character. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor. the question ""where are all the men?"" is likely not meant to be taken literally. instead, it's probably a humorous comment on a situation where there are unexpectedly few or no men present in a setting where men would typically be expected.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of concern doesn't match the likely true intention, which is to make a humorous observation. the exaggerated nature of the statement ""where are all the men?"" further supports this being a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine question.

given chandler's character, the context of the show, and the nature of the statement, this line is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a sincere question or observation.

therefore, the label is sarcastic.",1

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of enjoyment and anticipation from chandler. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the text. chandler is expressing his pleasure about the dessert and his plan to enjoy it on the balcony with a nice view. the language is straightforward and positive, without any obvious contradictions or ironic undertones that would suggest sarcasm.",0
CHANDLER: Really? Struck down in the prime of life.,"MONICA: Chandler, I think I am sick
",FRIENDS,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears sympathetic or concerned, with phrases like ""really?"" and ""struck down in the prime of life"" typically expressing shock or sadness about someone's untimely demise.

step 2: however, this is chandler speaking, a character known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends"". the phrase ""struck down in the prime of life"" is quite dramatic and exaggerated, which is often a hallmark of chandler's sarcastic comments. without more context, it's likely that chandler is not actually referring to someone's death, but rather making a joke about something minor or trivial.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment of concern with chandler's typical speech patterns and the likelihood that he's exaggerating for comedic effect, we can infer that this statement is indeed sarcastic. chandler is probably making light of a situation by dramatically overstating its seriousness.

"CHANDLER: I am not freaking out, why would I be freaking out? A woman named Hildy called and said we will get married, but that happens everyday","MONICA: I am so sorry, please stop freaking out.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears calm and dismissive. chandler says ""i am not freaking out"" and asks ""why would i be freaking out?"" this suggests he's trying to convey a lack of concern. he also mentions that a woman called about getting married as if it's a routine occurrence, saying ""that happens everyday.""

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, several clues indicate this is not chandler's true feeling:
1. the repetition of ""freaking out"" suggests he's actually quite agitated.
2. the sudden shift to mentioning a woman named hildy calling about marriage is abrupt and unusual.
3. the claim that getting calls about marriage happens everyday is clearly an exaggeration.
4. chandler's character in friends is known for using sarcasm and humor to deflect from his true feelings.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment tries to convey calmness, the true intention reveals that chandler is indeed freaking out and using sarcasm to cope with the unexpected news. the exaggeration and dismissive tone are classic markers of sarcasm.

CHANDLER: I was making a coconut phone with a professor.,"JOEY: Where the hell have you been?
",FRIENDS,1,"since this input requires some analysis to determine if it's sarcastic, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis. it's a simple statement about making a coconut phone with a professor.

step 2: true intention
this statement is likely not meant to be taken literally. making a ""coconut phone"" is not a common or realistic activity, especially with a professor. this sounds like an absurd or made-up excuse, possibly to cover for something else or to make a joke.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface neutrality contrasts with the likely absurdity of the statement's content. the use of an unrealistic scenario (making a coconut phone) in a matter-of-fact tone is a common technique in sarcasm or humor. the inclusion of ""with a professor"" adds to the unlikely nature of the statement, further suggesting it's not meant to be taken seriously.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses the classic sarcastic technique of saying something absurd in a straightforward manner, likely as a humorous excuse or deflection.",1
CHANDLER: What do you know? Its a treat for the eyes and the ears.,"PHOEBE: Chandler?
 CHANDLER: Hey! Ah!
 MONICA: What do you think?
 CHANDLER: I think I can see your scalp!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""treat for the eyes and ears"" typically indicates something enjoyable or pleasurable to both see and hear.

step 2: true intention
this line is from the tv show ""friends,"" and it's spoken by chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor. in the context of the show, chandler often uses positive-sounding phrases to express negative opinions. the exaggerated nature of ""treat for the eyes and ears"" suggests that he might be saying the opposite of what he means.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, chandler's character and typical speech patterns suggest that he's likely using this phrase sarcastically. without more context, it's difficult to be 100% certain, but given chandler's tendency towards sarcasm, especially when using overly positive language, it's highly probable that this statement is meant sarcastically.

CHANDLER: I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there .,"CHANDLER: Wish I could switch with someone.
",FRIENDS,0,"i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. chandler explicitly states ""i really don't wanna sit with allen iverson over there."" the phrase ""really don't wanna"" expresses a strong negative preference.

step 2: true intention
this requires some context. allen iverson is a famous basketball player known for his skill and popularity. chandler's statement seems to imply that someone nearby resembles or is behaving like allen iverson. in the context of the show ""friends"" (where chandler is a character), this is likely a humorous or exaggerated comparison.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention appears to be humor through exaggeration. chandler is likely not actually referring to allen iverson, but using the basketball star's name as a hyperbolic comparison to describe someone nearby, possibly someone who is acting showy or skilled in some way.

this use of exaggeration and unexpected cultural reference for humorous effect is a common form of sarcasm, especially for chandler's character.

"CHANDLER: Gee, if only she were one and had no idea what a birthday was.","RACHEL: You can't go away this weekend, its Emma's birthday, we are having a party.
 MONICA: Well can't you just have the party when we get back?
 RACHEL: No, it won't be her real birthday.
",FRIENDS,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat wishful or hopeful, with chandler saying ""gee, if only..."" this phrase typically expresses a desire for something to be true.

step 2: true intention
however, the content of the wish is absurd - wishing for someone to be one year old and not understand birthdays. this is clearly not a genuine wish, but rather a sarcastic comment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between the seemingly wishful tone and the absurd content of the wish is a clear indicator of sarcasm. chandler is likely making this comment in response to someone acting childish or naive about birthdays, and he's exaggerating this behavior to the point of absurdity for comedic effect.

given chandler's character in the sitcom ""friends"" and his frequent use of sarcasm, this comment fits perfectly with his typical style of humor. the sarcasm is quite evident, hence my high confidence in this classification.",1
"CHANDLER: Oh sure, she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening.","MONICA: Hey
 CHANDLER: Hey, where's the birthday girl?
 RACHEL: Oh she is still napping.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. chandler uses phrases like ""oh sure"" and talks about someone being ""excited"" about a party, which on the surface seems enthusiastic and positive.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and chandler's character (known for his sarcastic humor) suggest that his true intention is to express doubt or disbelief. the phrase ""she was probably up all night excited"" is likely an exaggeration used to highlight the unlikelihood of the scenario.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the underlying skepticism or disbelief is a classic indicator of sarcasm. chandler is using an exaggerated positive statement to actually convey a negative or doubtful sentiment about the situation.

given this analysis and my familiarity with chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" i'm very confident in labeling this statement as sarcastic.",1
CHANDLER: Are you still enjoying your nap?,"ROSS: Okay?
 CHANDLER: Hi Emma, it's the year 2020.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the question ""are you still enjoying your nap?"" seems like a straightforward inquiry about someone's nap, with ""enjoying"" suggesting a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
however, considering this is from chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor, and the context of asking someone if they're ""still"" enjoying their nap, it's likely that this isn't a genuine question about a nap. the true intention is probably to point out that someone has been sleeping for too long or at an inappropriate time.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (a seemingly innocent question about enjoying a nap) contrasts with the likely true intention (pointing out someone's excessive or ill-timed sleep). this mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the question appears friendly on the surface but is likely meant to criticize or mock the person for sleeping too much or at the wrong time, which is characteristic of chandler's sarcastic style of humor.",1
"CHANDLER: Hes not right for the part, and if I suggest him my bosses are going to think I am an idiot. And thatÕs something they should learn on their own.","CHANDLER: What am I gonna do now?
 RACHEL: Just pass the tape along.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems straightforward. chandler is explaining why he won't suggest someone for a part, stating that his bosses would think he's an idiot if he did.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear in the last sentence: ""and that's something they should learn on their own."" this is the key to the sarcasm. chandler is implying that his bosses will eventually think he's an idiot regardless, so he doesn't need to speed up that process.

step 3: the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the apparent concern about his bosses' opinion and the cynical implication that they'll think poorly of him anyway. the humor comes from chandler's self-deprecating style and the unexpected twist at the end.

this is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic humor from the tv show friends, where he often uses such self-deprecating and witty remarks. the sarcasm is subtle but clear, especially in the context of his character.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic.""",1
"CHANDLER: Oh yeah he has a caretaker his older brother, Ernie. You can't make this stuff up!","JOEY: Helo! Anybody in there order a celebrity?
 PERSON: What was that?
 CHANDLER: Oh he is just a crazy guy who roams the halls here. He is great with kids though!
 PERSON: Is he alright out there by himself?
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

the statement ""you can't make this stuff up!"" is a classic sarcastic expression. chandler is commenting on the unusual or seemingly contrived nature of the situation (someone named ernie being the caretaker for his younger brother), implying that it sounds so ridiculous or coincidental that it seems like fiction. this phrase is often used sarcastically to point out absurd or unbelievable situations that are actually true, which is exactly how chandler is using it here. the sarcasm lies in the irony of saying you can't make it up when in fact it is real.",1
CHANDLER: Is it me or the greetings gone downhill around here?,"CHANDLER: Hey
 JOEY: You son of a bitch!
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears slightly negative. chandler is questioning the quality of greetings, suggesting they've ""gone downhill,"" which implies a decline or deterioration in quality.

step 2: true intention
this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic and witty comments. the true intention here is probably not to actually criticize greetings, but to make a humorous observation about a lack of enthusiasm or warmth in a recent interaction. the phrasing ""is it me or..."" is often used rhetorically to point out something obvious in a humorous way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears negative, the true intention is likely to be humorous rather than genuinely critical. chandler is using a rhetorical question and exaggeration (""gone downhill"") to make a witty observation. this mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a rhetorical question and exaggeration to make a humorous point, which is characteristic of chandler's sarcastic style in ""friends."" the apparent criticism is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a witty observation, making this statement sarcastic.",1
"CHANDLER: You are right, by saying nice, I am virtually licking her.","CHANDLER: Did I go to this school?
 ROSS: Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
 CHANDLER: Sure, nice.
 ROSS: Dude. You're married to my sister.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive with the use of words like ""right"" and ""nice,"" which typically convey agreement and pleasantness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually to mock or ridicule the idea that simply saying ""nice"" is equivalent to an overly intimate act like ""virtually licking her."" chandler is using hyperbole and absurd exaggeration to make fun of the notion.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly agreeable surface sentiment and the absurd exaggeration in the true meaning clearly indicates sarcasm. chandler is not actually agreeing that saying ""nice"" is like licking someone; he's pointing out how ridiculous that idea is through sarcastic agreement.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.",1
"CHANDLER: Yes and we are ""very"" excited about it.","ROSS: Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help put together my new furniture.
",FRIENDS,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the word ""excited."" the use of quotation marks around ""very"" is notable, but looking purely at the words, it seems positive.

step 2: true intention
the quotation marks around ""very"" are a key indicator here. in spoken dialogue, this often indicates a sarcastic or exaggerated tone. chandler from the tv show friends is known for his sarcastic humor. the use of quotation marks suggests he's not actually excited, but rather the opposite.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the use of quotation marks and knowledge of the character strongly suggest that the true intention is to convey the opposite of excitement. this mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.
