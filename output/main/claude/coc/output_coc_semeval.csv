@Callisto1947 Can U Help?||More conservatives needed on #TSU + get paid 4 posting stuff like this!||YOU $ can go to http://t.co/JUmMWi0AyT,0,"not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the text appears to be a straightforward request or advertisement for conservative individuals to join a social media campaign. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the message. the tone seems earnest in trying to recruit people for paid social media posting, which is a common practice in political and marketing campaigns.",0
"Just walked in to #Starbucks and asked for a ""tall blonde"" Hahahaha #irony",1,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or humorous. the use of ""hahahaha"" indicates laughter, and the hashtag ""#irony"" suggests the author finds something amusing about the situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to make a joke about the double meaning of ""tall blonde."" in starbucks terminology, it refers to a size and type of coffee. however, it can also describe a person's physical appearance. the author is purposely drawing attention to this double meaning.

step 3: analysis and inference
by comparing the surface sentiment (apparent amusement) with the true intention (making a play on words), we can infer that this is indeed sarcastic. the use of ""#irony"" further confirms this interpretation. the author is not genuinely finding it hilarious to order coffee but is rather pointing out the humorous linguistic coincidence in a sarcastic manner.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this tweet as ""sarcastic"".",1
#NOT GONNA WIN http://t.co/Mc9ebqjAqj,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""not gonna win"" appears to express a negative sentiment or prediction about losing. the use of all caps adds emphasis to this negative outlook.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. the linked image (http://t.co/mc9ebqjaqj) could provide crucial context, but we can't see it. the use of all caps could be genuine emphasis or could be overexaggeration for effect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, it's safer to assume this statement is meant literally. while there's a possibility of sarcasm (e.g., if the linked image showed something contradictory), we don't have enough evidence to confidently label it as sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

i've chosen ""not sarcastic"" based on the available information, but i acknowledge there's some uncertainty without being able to see the linked content.",0
@mickymantell He is exactly that sort of person. Weirdo!,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of negative sentiment without any evident sarcasm. the use of ""weirdo!"" as an exclamation reinforces the genuineness of the negative opinion being expressed. the speaker seems to be agreeing with a previous statement about someone's character and adding their own negative characterization. there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm in this short text.",0
So much #sarcasm at work mate 10/10 #boring 100% #dead mate full on #shit absolutely #sleeping mate can't handle the #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

1. the text is heavily laden with hashtags that are typically used to denote sarcasm or irony (#sarcasm, #boring, #dead, #shit, #sleeping).

2. the phrase ""so much #sarcasm at work"" is itself a sarcastic statement, especially when followed by ""mate 10/10,"" which is an exaggerated positive rating.

3. the repetitive use of negative descriptors (#boring, #dead, #shit, #sleeping) contrasts with the seemingly positive opening, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

4. the final phrase ""can't handle the #sarcasm"" is a meta-commentary on the sarcastic nature of the entire statement.

given these factors, it's clear that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their dissatisfaction with their work environment, likely finding it boring or unpleasant. the overuse of hashtags and exaggerated language further emphasizes the sarcastic tone. therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic.""",1
Corny jokes are my absolute favorite,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- use of ""favorite"" which is a strong positive word
- ""absolute"" as an intensifier, emphasizing the positive sentiment

step 2: true intention
there are a few considerations here:
- corny jokes are generally considered low-quality or cheesy humor
- people often claim to like things ironically for comedic effect
- the statement is quite short and lacks context, making it harder to determine sincerity

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly positive, the use of ""corny"" introduces ambiguity. it's possible this is a sincere statement from someone who genuinely enjoys simple humor. however, given the tendency for people to use sarcasm when discussing things typically seen as unfavorable (like corny jokes), there's a significant chance this is a sarcastic statement.

given the ambiguity and lack of additional context, i'm not 100% certain, but i lean towards classifying this as sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
"People complain about my backround pic and all I feel is like ""hey don't blame me, Albert E might have spoken those words"" #sarcasm #life",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the use of quotation marks around a mock defensive statement (""hey don't blame me, albert e might have spoken those words"") suggests the author is not being sincere.

2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly used, which is a direct signal that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

3. the contrast between people complaining about the background picture and the author's exaggerated, mock-innocent response implies sarcasm.

4. the reference to albert einstein (albert e) in this context is likely meant to be humorous and not serious.

these elements, especially the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"", make it clear that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic, hence the classification.",1
"@SR_Duncan @benpobjie Darn, my sock joke needs fixing?",0,"let's think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of mild disappointment or concern. the use of ""darn"" suggests frustration, and the phrase ""my sock joke needs fixing"" implies that something is wrong or inadequate.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, this tweet seems to be a playful response to a conversation about jokes. the mention of a ""sock joke"" in the context of social media banter suggests that this is likely not a serious concern but rather a light-hearted exchange. the question mark at the end also indicates a tone of mock surprise or exaggerated concern.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment suggests frustration, the true intention appears to be humorous and self-deprecating. the exaggerated concern over something as trivial as a ""sock joke"" is likely meant to be amusing rather than genuinely distressed. the contrast between the apparent disappointment and the trivial nature of the subject (a sock joke) creates a humorous effect.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence that this tweet is sarcastic. the user is playfully exaggerating their concern over the quality of their joke, which is a common form of self-deprecating humor often employed in sarcastic comments.

### label: sarcastic",1
"if Christian expects Fifa to sleep in my bed with me tonight, he's wrong 👿",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or confrontational. key elements:
- ""he's wrong"" indicates disagreement or defiance
- the devil emoji (👿) at the end reinforces a negative or angry tone
- the statement implies someone (christian) has an expectation that the speaker strongly disagrees with

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be humor or playfulness, rather than genuine anger:
- the subject matter (sleeping with ""fifa"" in the bed) is unexpected and somewhat absurd
- ""fifa"" likely refers to a pet (probably a dog), not a person
- the exaggerated reaction to a pet sleeping in the bed suggests the speaker is being dramatic for comedic effect

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention appears to be humorous. the speaker is using an exaggerated, mock-angry tone to joke about their partner's (christian's) expectation regarding a pet sleeping in the bed. this discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
"People who tell people with anxiety to ""just stop worrying about it"" are my favorite kind of people #not #educateyourself",1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""my favorite kind of people."" this initially suggests a genuine appreciation for these individuals.

step 2: however, the true intention is quite different. the context is about people giving simplistic advice to those with anxiety. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#educateyourself"" are key indicators that the author actually disagrees with this behavior. the use of ""just stop worrying about it"" in quotes suggests the author is mocking this overly simplistic advice.

step 3: comparing the surface positive sentiment with the true negative intention, we can clearly see the discrepancy. the author is using irony to criticize people who give unhelpful advice to those with anxiety. the positive statement ""my favorite kind of people"" is actually meant to convey the opposite meaning.

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic, using irony to criticize a behavior the author finds problematic.",1
Most important thing I've learned in school http://t.co/TvfJMGBlBh,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""most important thing i've learned"" suggests something valuable or significant. there are no overtly negative words or emojis.

step 2: true intention
without seeing the content of the link (http://t.co/tvfjmgblbh), it's difficult to determine the true intention with certainty. however, the structure of the tweet suggests that the linked content might contradict or humorously undermine the idea of it being the ""most important thing"" learned in school. the brevity and lack of explanation also hint at potential sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analyze
the contrast between the seemingly serious claim of learning something important in school and the likelihood that the linked content is trivial or humorous points towards sarcasm. the use of hyperbole (""most important thing"") combined with the unexplained link is a common structure for sarcastic tweets.

### label: sarcastic

while there's some uncertainty without seeing the linked content, the structure and tone of the tweet strongly suggest sarcasm. the exaggerated claim about school learning paired with an unexplained link is likely setting up a humorous contradiction.",1
#OrionLaunch underway - yeah! #Orion http://t.co/0Qkv1yq8T0,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be genuinely expressing excitement and support for the orion launch. the use of ""yeah!"" is a clear expression of enthusiasm, and there's no indication of sarcasm or irony in the text. the inclusion of a hashtag and link further suggests this is a straightforward, positive announcement about the orion launch event.",0
I love context and large ensemble Fridays!!!!! Der my most favourite #Sarcasm #GetTheFuckOut,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- use of ""love""
- exclamation marks indicating enthusiasm
- ""most favourite"" expressing strong preference

step 2: true intention
several clues suggest the true intention is actually negative:
- excessive punctuation (!!!!!!) can indicate exaggeration or insincerity
- ""der"" (likely meant to be ""they're"") seems to mock or imitate someone
- use of hashtags #sarcasm and #getthefuckout explicitly indicates sarcasm and frustration
- the overall tone seems exaggerated and insincere

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention appears to be expressing frustration or dislike through sarcasm. the explicit use of #sarcasm leaves little doubt about the author's intent.

### label: sarcastic",1
Oh boy... @masongoodman in the house. Warm up the DJ booth @AnnexBar,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of excitement or anticipation rather than sarcasm. the phrase ""oh boy..."" is often used to express enthusiasm, and the rest of the tweet seems to be announcing the presence of @masongoodman at a venue called @annexbar, with a request to prepare the dj booth. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or conflicting sentiments that would suggest a sarcastic intent.",0
"LIAR, i've never denied the 532 murders in Chicago in 2012 @RBRNetwork1 @TheOldBreed1775 @Dolphin__Man @Joseph_WarrenDR @jus1314tin",0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the use of the word ""liar"" in all caps at the beginning. the tweet also mentions ""murders,"" which is a negative topic.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be defensive and confrontational. the author is responding to an accusation of denying murders in chicago. the use of ""liar"" suggests they're strongly refuting this accusation. the specific number (532) and year (2012) indicate they're familiar with the statistics, implying they've never denied this fact.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the opening ""liar"" could be interpreted as sarcastic in some contexts, the rest of the tweet appears to be a straightforward, albeit confrontational, denial of an accusation. the author seems to be genuinely asserting that they've never denied the murders, rather than using sarcasm to make a point.

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is not sarcastic. the author is being direct and confrontational, but not employing sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic",0
"Always classy, never trashy and just a little sassy.",0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine, positive self-description or personal motto rather than a sarcastic comment. the phrase uses alliteration and a balanced structure to convey a confident, upbeat sentiment about one's personality or approach to life. there's no apparent contradiction or irony that would suggest sarcasm, so i believe this can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0
"you believe you can say something, provide no proof and its a fact, WRONG @RBRNetwork1 @jtarleta53",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet does not appear to be sarcastic. the author is directly and bluntly criticizing someone's approach to stating facts without evidence. the use of ""wrong"" in all caps emphasizes the author's disagreement and frustration, but it's a straightforward expression rather than sarcasm. the tweet seems to be a genuine criticism or rebuttal to someone else's statement or behavior, without employing irony or saying the opposite of what is meant.",0

@CorporalFrisk Guess they didn't get the memo reg non-nuclear Baltic sea #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end, which is a direct indicator that the author intended the message to be interpreted as sarcastic. additionally, the phrase ""guess they didn't get the memo"" is often used sarcastically to imply that someone has missed or ignored obvious information. in this case, it's referring to the idea of a ""non-nuclear baltic sea,"" which is likely a reference to some geopolitical or environmental issue. the sarcastic tone suggests that the author believes this idea is being ignored or violated in some way.",1
Exam na jud. Merry christmas. ||#Sarcasm|#KillUsSlowly,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. ""merry christmas"" is a cheerful holiday greeting, which on its own would indicate a positive sentiment.

step 2: however, several factors indicate that the true intention is sarcastic:

1. the first part ""exam na jud"" (which seems to be in cebuano and roughly translates to ""it's really exam time"") contrasts with the christmas greeting, suggesting an incongruity.

2. the hashtags at the end are crucial indicators:
   - ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the post as sarcastic.
   - ""#killusslowly"" expresses a negative sentiment, implying that exams during christmas time are a form of slow torture.

3. the juxtaposition of ""merry christmas"" with the exam reference and the negative hashtag creates irony.

step 3: comparing the surface positive sentiment (""merry christmas"") with the true negative intention revealed by the context and hashtags, it's clear that this is a sarcastic statement. the author is using the cheerful christmas greeting ironically to highlight the unpleasantness of having exams, possibly during or near the holiday season.

the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" removes any doubt, confirming that this is indeed a sarcastic post.",1
The definition of #IRONY would be if a 77-year-old rapper went #viral and took #BITCOIN mainstream. Maybe only way #babyboomers will buy in.,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the text discusses a hypothetical scenario of an elderly rapper going viral and promoting bitcoin, potentially leading to wider adoption among baby boomers. there are no overtly positive or negative words, but the use of hashtags like #irony and the speculation about bitcoin going mainstream suggest a somewhat playful or amused tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be highlighting the unlikelihood and absurdity of the scenario described. the use of ""#irony"" at the beginning strongly suggests that the author is pointing out a contradictory or unexpected situation. the idea of a 77-year-old rapper (typically associated with youth culture) becoming a viral sensation and influencing cryptocurrency adoption among baby boomers (often stereotyped as technology-averse) is presented as an unlikely and humorous concept.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention reveals a discrepancy. while the text doesn't use overtly sarcastic language, the use of ""#irony"" and the presentation of an unlikely scenario indicate that the author is employing sarcasm to comment on the current state of bitcoin adoption and generational technology gaps. the sarcasm is subtle but present in the juxtaposition of unlikely elements (elderly rapper, viral fame, bitcoin, baby boomers) to make a point about the challenges of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of ""#irony"", the unlikely scenario presented, and the subtle commentary on generational technology adoption all point to this being a sarcastic statement.",1
Pretty excited about how you gave up on me. File Under: #sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

this input can be confidently labeled as sarcastic without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the reasons for this confidence are:

1. the explicit use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the statement clearly indicates that the speaker intends the message to be understood as sarcasm.

2. the content of the message itself demonstrates a classic sarcastic structure: expressing excitement about something that would typically be disappointing or upsetting (someone giving up on the speaker).

3. the phrase ""pretty excited about"" contrasts sharply with the negative action of ""gave up on me,"" which is a clear indicator of sarcastic intent.

given these clear markers, especially the explicit sarcasm tag, we can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic without needing further analysis.",1
Who told the #hipsters that #irony was a thing of the Clinton years? Do they not carry history books in used bookstores in #brooklyn ?,1,"to accurately classify this text, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning or critical. key phrases like ""who told the #hipsters"" and ""do they not carry history books"" suggest a critical tone towards hipsters and their knowledge of history.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or ridiculing hipsters. the author is using rhetorical questions to imply that hipsters are ignorant about the history of irony, suggesting it's not just a recent trend. the mention of ""used bookstores in #brooklyn"" further emphasizes the stereotypical hipster image.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface questioning with the underlying mockery, it's clear that the author is not genuinely seeking answers. instead, they're using these questions to make a point about hipsters' perceived lack of historical knowledge and their trend-following behavior. the use of hashtags (#hipsters, #irony, #brooklyn) adds to the sarcastic tone, as if cataloging hipster stereotypes.

### label: sarcastic

the text uses rhetorical questions and stereotypical references to hipster culture to convey a sarcastic criticism of hipsters' understanding of irony and history. the contrast between the seemingly inquisitive surface and the mocking intention clearly indicates sarcasm.",1

@LukeLPearson hmm... let me think about that #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification due to the clear indicators in the text:

1. the phrase ""hmm... let me think about that"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is obvious or doesn't require much thought.

2. the explicit use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet is a direct signal that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

these elements combined make it clear that the tweet is meant to be sarcastic, so i can confidently classify it as such without needing to break down the analysis further.",1
"If you wanna look like a badass, have drama on social media #not",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or encouraging. ""wanna look like a badass"" suggests admiration for looking tough or cool. ""have drama on social media"" could be seen as promoting excitement or attention-seeking behavior, which some might view positively.

step 2: true intention
however, the ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the true intention is the opposite of what's stated. this hashtag is commonly used to denote sarcasm or to negate the preceding statement. the author is actually criticizing or mocking the idea of trying to look ""badass"" through social media drama.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment encourages a behavior, while the true intention criticizes it. the use of ""#not"" creates a stark contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the author is using irony to make a point about the foolishness of seeking attention through social media conflicts.

### label: sarcastic

the clear use of ""#not"" to contradict the preceding statement, combined with the mocking tone towards attention-seeking behavior on social media, strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic comment.",1
How dare Charles Barkley have an intelligent conversation about race. #sarcasm #CharlesBarkley,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses sarcasm by expressing mock outrage (""how dare..."") at charles barkley having an intelligent conversation about race. this implies that the author actually thinks it's good that barkley had such a conversation, contrary to the surface-level criticism.

the use of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end explicitly confirms the sarcastic intent, making this classification very straightforward.",1
"@LaurenBailes I think the general rule is, if it's open all night, pull an all-nighter.",0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive and encouraging. the phrase ""i think the general rule is"" suggests offering advice or a guideline. the statement ""if it's open all night, pull an all-nighter"" seems to be promoting staying up all night if a place is open 24 hours.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention of this statement is likely not to genuinely promote staying up all night. the ""rule"" being suggested is not a sensible or healthy one. pulling an all-nighter simply because a place is open all night is not typically considered good advice.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (apparently positive advice) contrasts with the true intention (likely not meant to be taken seriously). the statement presents an exaggerated and potentially harmful ""rule"" as if it were sound advice. this mismatch between the apparent advice and its impracticality is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses the format of giving advice to actually mock the idea of staying up all night just because a place is open. it's a tongue-in-cheek comment that shouldn't be taken at face value, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1

Nooooooooooo again it's on!!! #PickANewSong #CantStandIt,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or excited due to:
- ""nooooooooooo"" with extended ""o""s, which can indicate enthusiasm
- ""again it's on!!!"" with multiple exclamation marks, suggesting excitement
- use of hashtags, which often accompany positive social media posts

step 2: true intention
however, analyzing deeper:
- ""nooooooooooo"" could actually express frustration or annoyance
- ""#pickanewsong"" implies dissatisfaction with the current song
- ""#cantstandit"" directly states negative feelings towards the situation

the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or annoyance at a song being played again, which the speaker dislikes.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface excitement contrasts sharply with the true negative sentiment. the exaggerated positive tone (""nooooooooooo"", multiple exclamation marks) is used to emphasize the speaker's actual frustration. this deliberate mismatch between the apparent enthusiasm and the real annoyance is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the text uses an exaggerated positive tone to express a negative sentiment about a song being played repeatedly, which is a clear example of sarcasm.",1
"Being a hipster now is so mainstream. Oh, the irony. #hipster #irony",1,"sarcastic

@BunnyDhillon17 exactly and we are fighting like animals,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the phrase ""fighting like animals,"" which typically has a negative connotation. the word ""exactly"" at the beginning suggests agreement with a previous statement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing genuine concern or frustration about a situation where people are behaving poorly or aggressively. the use of ""we"" includes the speaker in this behavior, suggesting self-awareness and possibly regret or disappointment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the statement seems to be a straightforward agreement with a previous point and an honest observation about people's behavior (including the speaker's own).

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of concern or frustration rather than a sarcastic comment. the language used is direct and doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or irony.",0
http://t.co/PfJ92w4CwZ #TeenAnalCasting #Top Top 50 Christian Songs For 2012,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the input is unusual and requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text contains hashtags and mentions ""top 50 christian songs for 2012"", which on the surface appears to be about christian music. however, it also includes ""#teenanalcasting"", which is jarringly incongruous with christian content.

step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of christian music with an explicit sexual hashtag seems intentional. the true intention appears to be shock value or to highlight hypocrisy by pairing religious content with pornographic references.

step 3: analysis and inference
the stark contrast between the christian music reference and the pornographic hashtag creates an absurd and shocking juxtaposition. this deliberate pairing of opposing concepts is a common technique in sarcasm, used to highlight perceived contradictions or hypocrisy.

given this analysis, i believe this text is intended to be provocative and satirical rather than a genuine promotion of either christian music or pornographic content.

The girls on #SororitySisters thought they'd get rich and famous but instead they be like... http://t.co/yGnRtq0tVy,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems somewhat negative or critical. the phrase ""thought they'd get rich and famous but instead they be like..."" suggests a contrast between expectations and reality, often used in a mocking tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be mocking or criticizing the participants of #sororitysisters. the tweet implies that their expectations of wealth and fame were unrealistic, and the reality (shown in the linked image, which we can't see) is likely less glamorous or desirable. the use of informal language (""they be like"") adds to the mocking tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that the tweet is using irony to criticize or make fun of the show's participants. the contrast between their expectations and the implied reality is a classic structure for sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to mock the participants' expectations, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the contrast between hopes of getting ""rich and famous"" and the implied disappointing reality, along with the casual, mocking tone, strongly indicates sarcastic intent.",1
"Speaking of #country #music albums, anyone else think #SundownHeavenTown feels more like a #TimMcGraw album than, say, his previous three?",0,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. the tweet is asking a question about a country music album, comparing it to previous works by the same artist. there are no overtly positive or negative words, and the tone seems inquisitive rather than emotional.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a genuine question or observation about tim mcgraw's album ""sundown heaven town."" the user is noting that this album feels more characteristic of mcgraw's style compared to his previous three albums. this doesn't appear to have any hidden meaning or contradictory subtext.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the tweet appears to be a straightforward question about music styles and album characteristics. there's no evidence of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would indicate sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

Well got the truck buried today perfect way to start a rainy Wednesday work day off #not #annoyed #pissed,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""got the truck buried,"" ""rainy wednesday,"" and hashtags like ""#annoyed"" and ""#pissed"" all indicate a negative mood. the phrase ""perfect way to start"" initially seems positive, but in context, it's likely meant ironically.

step 2: true intention:
the true intention is to express frustration and annoyance. the author is describing a bad start to their workday, with their truck getting stuck (likely in mud due to rain). the use of ""perfect way"" is clearly sarcastic, as getting a vehicle stuck is not actually a good way to start a day.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
while the overall sentiment is negative both on the surface and in true intention, the use of sarcasm is evident. the phrase ""perfect way"" contrasts sharply with the reality of the situation, which is a classic sarcastic device. the hashtag ""#not"" further confirms the sarcastic tone, as it's commonly used to denote sarcasm in social media.

### label: sarcastic

the text uses clear sarcastic elements to express frustration about a bad situation, making ""sarcastic"" the appropriate classification.",1
"On the train and surrounded by posh people, I'm so at home! #not #stickoutlikeasorethumb",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""i'm so at home!"" suggests comfort and belonging. this is supported by the exclamation mark, which typically indicates enthusiasm or positivity.

step 2: true intention
however, there are strong indicators that the true intention is the opposite:
1. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly negates the previous statement.
2. the hashtag ""#stickoutlikeasorethumb"" directly contradicts feeling ""at home"" and implies discomfort and not fitting in.
3. the mention of being ""surrounded by posh people"" sets up a contrast between the speaker and their environment, hinting at discomfort.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is clearly positive, but the true intention, as revealed by the hashtags and context, is negative. the speaker is using verbal irony to express their discomfort and feeling out of place. they say they feel ""at home"" when they actually feel the opposite.

### label: sarcastic

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention, along with the explicit use of ""#not"" and the contradictory hashtag, clearly indicates that this statement is sarcastic.",1
Stupid #doctors visits is gonna bury me!! Now that's #irony,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of the word ""stupid""
- exclamation marks indicating frustration
- the phrase ""gonna bury me"" suggesting overwhelming difficulty

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate this is actually sarcastic:
- the hashtag #irony at the end explicitly signals the author's intent
- the exaggerated language ""gonna bury me"" is likely hyperbole
- juxtaposition of ""doctors visits"" (typically associated with health) with being ""buried"" (death) creates ironic contrast

step 3: analysis and final label
the surface negative sentiment contrasts with the likely intended meaning. the author is using exaggeration and irony to comment on the high cost or frequency of doctor visits, rather than actually believing they will die from them. the explicit use of #irony confirms the sarcastic intent.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
"Love the way @virginmedia says fault from last night will be fixed by 4pm, only to see a man in a van pull up at 4pm to fix the fault #irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to the phrase ""love the way."" however, the use of ""#irony"" at the end immediately signals that this positive sentiment may not be genuine.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear when we analyze the full context:
1. the author mentions virgin media saying a fault would be fixed by 4pm.
2. at exactly 4pm, a repair van arrives to fix the fault.
3. the use of ""#irony"" indicates that the author finds this timing ironic or contradictory.

the author is actually expressing frustration or annoyance at the company's timing, suggesting that the fault wasn't actually fixed by 4pm as promised, but rather that's when they started working on it.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface positive sentiment (""love the way"") is clearly contradicted by the true intention of expressing frustration. the use of positive language to express a negative sentiment, combined with the explicit ""#irony"" tag, strongly indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to criticize virgin media's customer service and timing, making the ""sarcastic"" label the appropriate choice.",1
Planning a vacation instead of studying.... My priorities are in line. #NOT,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses several indicators of sarcasm:

1. the statement ""my priorities are in line"" contrasts with the action of planning a vacation instead of studying, which most would consider misaligned priorities.

2. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear marker of sarcasm, explicitly indicating that the preceding statement should be interpreted oppositely.

3. the ellipsis (....) adds a pause for dramatic effect, often used in sarcastic statements.

these elements together create a clearly sarcastic message where the speaker is acknowledging their priorities are actually not in line, using irony to make this point.",1
Dan said he's going to have a sign for me at the airport when I fly in lol #SoCute #3MoreWeeks,0,"let me analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key indicators:
- ""lol"" (laugh out loud) suggests amusement
- ""#socute"" hashtag expresses endearment
- ""#3moreweeks"" implies excitement or anticipation
the overall tone seems affectionate and looking forward to something.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony. the speaker appears genuinely pleased about dan's gesture of having a sign at the airport, finding it cute, and looking forward to the meeting in three weeks.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in agreement. there's no detectable mismatch or irony that would suggest sarcasm. the tone is consistently positive and sincere throughout the message.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine expression of affection and anticipation without any sarcastic undertones.",0
You decide to go on vacation without me sleep? Reaaaal nice. #considerate #not 😒💤,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance with phrases like ""you decide to go on vacation"" and ""reaaaal nice."" however, there are clear negative indicators:
- the use of ""without me"" suggests exclusion
- the exaggerated spelling of ""reaaaal"" hints at insincerity
- the hashtag ""#not"" directly contradicts the ""nice"" sentiment
- the use of the unamused face emoji 😒 and sleeping emoji 💤 convey negative emotions

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to express disappointment and criticism. the speaker is upset about being left out of vacation plans, likely while they have to work or stay behind. the exaggerated positive language is used ironically to emphasize how inconsiderate they find this action.

step 3: comparison and final analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""nice"") is clearly contradicted by the negative indicators and the true critical intention. the use of exaggeration, contradictory hashtags, and emojis all point to a sarcastic tone. the speaker is using sarcasm to express their dissatisfaction with the situation.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
@ChainAttackJay No sugar during christmas time? :(,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of disappointment or surprise at the idea of not having sugar during christmas time. the sad face emoticon "":("" reinforces the sincere sentiment. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony in this short message. it seems to be a straightforward question and expression of mild dismay, likely in response to someone suggesting or mentioning avoiding sugar during the holiday season.",0
Can't wait to have an afternoon schedule because of you. It's gonna be so much fun #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""can't wait"" and ""it's gonna be so much fun,"" which typically express excitement and anticipation.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues suggest the true intention is negative:
1. the phrase ""because of you"" implies the speaker is blaming someone for the schedule change.
2. an afternoon schedule is often less desirable than a morning one.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating the preceding statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""can't wait,"" ""so much fun"") contrasts sharply with the true negative feelings about the situation. the use of ""#not"" confirms that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.

therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic. the speaker is using positive language to express their displeasure about having an afternoon schedule, emphasizing their frustration through sarcasm.",1
@siddharth_0703 180 dead on 26/11 n more than 10k our ppl killed in terror attacks till date but not 1 paki show sympathy 2 them #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""180 dead"", ""10k our ppl killed in terror attacks"", and ""not 1 paki show sympathy"" indicate a serious, accusatory tone about terrorism and lack of sympathy.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the perceived hypocrisy or lack of empathy from pakistanis towards indian victims of terrorism. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a strong indicator that the author is pointing out a contradictory or unexpected situation.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is straightforward and negative, the use of ""#irony"" suggests the author is employing sarcasm to make their point. they're not being literally ironic, but rather using sarcasm to emphasize the perceived absurdity of the situation they're describing.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" as a hashtag, combined with the critical tone and the juxtaposition of tragic events with a lack of sympathy, strongly indicates that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic. the author is using sarcasm to highlight and criticize what they see as a lack of empathy or acknowledgment from pakistanis regarding terrorist attacks in india.",1
the ONLY time a crime becomes a federal crime @RBRNetwork1 @TheOldBreed1775 @Joseph_WarrenDR @jus1314tin @IndyEnigma @CoutoPanda,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text doesn't contain clear sentimental keywords or phrases. it's a statement about federal crimes, presented in an emphatic way with ""only"" capitalized. the tone seems serious or informative rather than overtly positive or negative.

step 2: true intention
the capitalization of ""only"" suggests emphasis or exaggeration. the statement seems incomplete or truncated, as it doesn't specify when a crime becomes a federal crime. this incompleteness, combined with the emphatic ""only,"" hints at potential sarcasm or criticism. the multiple twitter handles tagged imply this might be part of a larger conversation or debate about crime classification.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral and informative, the emphatic style and incomplete nature of the statement suggest the author may be criticizing or mocking a simplistic view of federal crimes. the sarcasm isn't blatant, but there's a subtle implication that the criteria for federal crimes are more complex than the statement suggests.

given this analysis, i believe there's a moderate likelihood of sarcasm, though it's not entirely clear-cut.

### label: sarcastic",1
this music is for the people and not for the money. peace and love. http://t.co/jPHID2P2Wc #KINGLIFE,0,"i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and idealistic. key phrases like ""for the people and not for the money"" and ""peace and love"" convey a message of altruism and harmony. the use of ""#kinglife"" also suggests a positive, empowered attitude.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony. the message seems straightforward and consistent with typical sentiments expressed by musicians who want to present themselves as authentic and community-oriented. the inclusion of a link and hashtag is common in genuine promotional tweets.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the likely true intention appear to align. there's no detectable contradiction or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm. the message is consistent with sincere promotional content often shared by musicians or their representatives.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of artistic values and self-promotion, without any discernible sarcastic elements.",0
Rangers league game with Alloa moved because of the Petrofac Cup final in April... #irony,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the tweet mentions a rangers league game being moved due to a cup final, which could be seen as an inconvenience. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end is a key indicator that there might be more to this statement.

step 2: the true intention of this tweet seems to be pointing out an ironic or absurd situation. the petrofac cup is generally considered a less prestigious competition compared to league games. the fact that a league game is being rescheduled to accommodate the final of this cup competition is likely seen as unexpected or disproportionate by the author.

step 3: comparing the surface neutrality of the statement with the implied criticism and the explicit use of ""#irony"", we can infer that this tweet is indeed sarcastic. the author is using irony to comment on what they perceive as a misplacement of priorities in scheduling.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" is a direct indicator of sarcastic intent, and the context of the situation described supports this interpretation.",1

I wonder what was the holiday rituals for true Africans,0,"given the input text, i don't have 90% confidence in making an immediate judgment, so i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or mildly curious. the phrase ""i wonder"" indicates genuine interest or curiosity. there are no overtly positive or negative words, no emojis, and no clear sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is less clear-cut. the phrase ""true africans"" could be problematic as it implies there's such a thing as ""false"" africans, which might be a generalizing or stereotyping statement. this could potentially be a setup for a sarcastic comment about cultural authenticity or stereotypes.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment seems genuinely curious, the use of ""true africans"" raises a flag. however, without more context or a clearer indication of sarcasm (such as exaggerated language, obvious irony, or a punchline), it's difficult to confidently label this as sarcastic.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the relatively straightforward nature of the question, i'm inclined to err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification is made with some reservation, as the true intent could potentially be sarcastic depending on the broader context in which this statement was made.",0
Been at the ER now since 10... #yay #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of ""#yay,"" which typically expresses joy or excitement.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention is clearly negative:
- being at the er (emergency room) since 10 (presumably 10 pm or 10 am) implies a long, unpleasant wait.
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous sentiment is meant to be negated or reversed.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly positive ""#yay"" and the reality of a long, frustrating wait at the er, coupled with the explicit negation ""#not,"" clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is using false enthusiasm to highlight their displeasure with the situation.

therefore, this tweet is definitively sarcastic.",1
@LanceMedow Suhs been clean for 2 years and has only been in the league for five don't act like he was dirty for 10 years#not biased my ass,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a reliable classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or confrontational. key phrases like ""don't act like"" and ""#not biased my ass"" indicate frustration or disagreement with someone's stance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be calling out perceived hypocrisy or bias. the speaker is pointing out that the player (suhs) has only been in the league for 5 years, with 2 of those being ""clean,"" implying it's unfair to characterize him as having a long history of dirty play. the phrase ""#not biased my ass"" is particularly telling, as it's clearly meant to sarcastically challenge someone's claim of being unbiased.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is confrontational, the true intention employs sarcasm to make its point. the use of ""my ass"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, used to mock the idea that the person they're addressing is actually unbiased. the overall structure of the comment, presenting facts and then using a sarcastic tag at the end, further supports the sarcastic classification.

### label: sarcastic",1
"@StevePulcinella @Coseph05 thank you studs for perfecting and teaching my bench, respectively. Props on form from lifters in AL. #DYEL",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the text includes words and phrases like ""thank you,"" ""studs,"" ""perfecting,"" ""props,"" which all indicate gratitude and praise. the hashtag ""#dyel"" (do you even lift) seems to be used in a supportive context among fitness enthusiasts.

step 2: upon closer inspection, there are a few elements that could suggest sarcasm:
1. the use of ""studs"" might be over-the-top praise.
2. the phrase ""perfecting and teaching my bench"" could be an exaggeration.
3. ""props on form from lifters in al"" seems oddly specific and potentially mocking.
4. the hashtag ""#dyel"" is sometimes used sarcastically to question someone's fitness level.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the potential underlying meaning, there's ambiguity. while it could be genuine praise, the exaggerated language and specific details hint at possible sarcasm. however, without more context about the relationship between the author and the mentioned individuals, it's difficult to be certain.

given the uncertainty, i would lean towards:

### label: not sarcastic

the text could be interpreted as genuine enthusiasm and gratitude within a fitness community, even if the language is somewhat exaggerated. without clearer indicators of sarcasm, it's safer to interpret this as sincere communication among fitness enthusiasts.",0

"30 years on, people still haven't got justice they deserve. #BhopalGasTragedy Yet another brilliant job done by the Americans #sarcasm",1,"label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""yet another brilliant job done by the americans"" is used sarcastically. in context, it's clear that the author doesn't actually think the americans did a brilliant job.

2. the explicit #sarcasm hashtag at the end confirms the sarcastic intent.

3. the contrast between the serious topic of the bhopal gas tragedy and lack of justice, and the seemingly positive statement about americans, further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

these elements together make it unambiguous that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic, criticizing the lack of justice and the role of american companies in the tragedy.",1
"Pips who drop out of school n have Kirya as 'eir role model tht ey wana sing too..guy spix Portuguese,French,english...#Not a school dropout",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the message contains some nuanced elements:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems mixed. there's a negative tone towards people dropping out of school to pursue singing careers. however, there's a positive sentiment towards kirya, mentioning his language skills and using the hashtag ""#not a school dropout"".

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be praising kirya while criticizing others who might drop out to emulate him without his skills. the author is highlighting that kirya is multilingual and educated, implying that his success isn't just about singing, but also about his broader knowledge and abilities.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a slight contrast between the criticism of school dropouts and the praise for kirya, this doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the author seems to be making a genuine point about the importance of education, using kirya as a positive example. the hashtag ""#not a school dropout"" reinforces this sincere message rather than undermining it sarcastically.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be making a straightforward, albeit nuanced, point about education and success, rather than employing sarcasm.",0

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, negative opinion about marc trestman's coaching career in the nfl. the language used is direct and harsh, but it doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. the user is expressing their belief that trestman's nfl coaching career is over due to poor performance, calling his hire ""disgraceful"" and stating he ""never stood a chance."" this aligns with typical criticism in sports discussions and doesn't seem to have a hidden or contrary meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0
Loooovvveeeeeee when my phone gets wiped -.- #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the exaggerated use of ""loooovvveeeeeee,"" which typically expresses strong affection or enjoyment.

step 2: however, several clues indicate this is not the true sentiment:
- the context of a phone being wiped is generally negative and frustrating.
- the use of the ""-.-"" emoticon represents annoyance or frustration.
- the ""#not"" hashtag at the end is a clear indicator that the previous statement should be interpreted as the opposite of what was said.

step 3: the stark contrast between the exaggerated positive sentiment in ""loooovvveeeeeee"" and the actual negative experience of having a phone wiped, combined with the frustration emoticon and the explicit ""#not"" tag, clearly indicate this is a sarcastic statement.

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic.""",1
Painting all cops with a broad brush because of the actions of a few is the same logic racists use. #Irony,1,"let's break this down step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be critical of those who generalize about police officers. the statement seems to draw a parallel between this generalization and racist logic, which is typically viewed negatively.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is more complex. the use of ""#irony"" at the end suggests that the author is aware of a contradiction or hypocrisy in their statement. this hashtag is a strong indicator that the author is not straightforwardly presenting their view, but rather pointing out a paradox or inconsistency.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface statement seems to defend police against broad generalizations. however, the ""#irony"" tag subverts this apparent meaning. it's likely that the author is actually criticizing those who defend police by pointing out that their logic (defending police against generalization) is inconsistent with their probable stance on racism (where they might be more willing to make generalizations).

given this analysis, especially the use of ""#irony"" which explicitly signals the author's sarcastic intent, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the presence of the irony hashtag, combined with the subtle critique of inconsistent logic, strongly indicates that this statement is indeed sarcastic.",1
Don't know if I can handle this crazy 11-2 shift. It's so long I might pass out on the job! #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm highly confident this tweet is sarcastic, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and anxious. key phrases like ""can't handle"", ""crazy shift"", ""so long"", and ""might pass out"" suggest the speaker is overwhelmed by their work schedule.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate this is not the true sentiment:
1. the shift mentioned (11-2) is actually very short, only 3 hours.
2. the exaggerated language (""crazy"", ""might pass out"") is over-the-top for such a short shift.
3. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels this as sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and conclusion
the extreme mismatch between the dramatically negative surface sentiment and the reality of a short work shift, combined with the explicit sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic statement. the speaker is actually joking about how easy their short shift is by pretending it's unbearably long and difficult.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1
I just love being ignored😊|#not😒,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the phrase ""i just love"" which typically expresses enjoyment
- the smiling face emoji 😊 at the end of the first part

step 2: the true intention seems negative because:
- the phrase ""being ignored"" is generally considered a negative experience
- the hashtag ""#not"" followed by a 😒 unamused face emoji strongly suggests the opposite of what was initially stated
- the combination of ""#not"" with the unamused emoji is a common way to express sarcasm on social media

step 3: comparing the surface positive sentiment with the underlying negative intention reveals a clear mismatch. the author is using verbal irony by stating they ""love"" something that is typically disliked. the use of contrasting emojis and the ""#not"" hashtag further emphasize this irony.

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to express frustration about being ignored, by stating the opposite of what is truly meant.",1
"#Irony RT @West1Jess: If you're going to give someone a scathing, 1-Star review for poor grammar, FFS use proper grammar.",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to phrases like ""scathing, 1-star review"" and ""poor grammar"". the use of ""ffs"" (an acronym for a frustrated expression) also indicates irritation or annoyance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is to point out the irony or hypocrisy of someone criticizing another person's grammar while making grammatical errors themselves. the tweet is highlighting the importance of being grammatically correct when critiquing others for the same issue.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention is to humorously point out the irony of the situation. the use of ""if you're going to..."" structure implies a conditional statement that emphasizes the absurdity of the scenario. the contrast between criticizing poor grammar and then using poor grammar oneself is the key to the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to make a point about hypocrisy in grammar criticism, which is a classic example of sarcasm.",1
Produce Mobile Apps #not http://t.co/3OV57ZhqcH http://t.co/wX1DbI8W9M,1,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message for mobile app development services. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony present. the hashtag ""#not"" is likely part of the url or an unrelated tag, rather than a sarcastic indicator in this context. the message is direct and informational, typical of business promotion on social media platforms.",0
Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it. -Bill Cosby|#irony,1,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and inspirational. the quote ""decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it"" seems to be motivational advice, encouraging people to overcome their fears and pursue their desires.

step 2: however, the true intention is likely different due to two key factors:
1. the quote is attributed to bill cosby, a formerly respected figure who has since been disgraced due to numerous sexual assault allegations.
2. the hashtag ""#irony"" is included at the end of the input.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that this is indeed sarcastic. the use of a quote from a now-controversial figure, combined with the explicit ""#irony"" tag, strongly suggests that the poster is not genuinely promoting this advice. instead, they are likely pointing out the irony of taking life advice from someone who has fallen from grace so dramatically.

therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1
"Finally finished the first season of #VeronicaMars. Move over, #CliffHuxtable. Keith Mars is the new sheriff--er, ultimate #TV dad--in town.",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the author seems to be genuinely expressing enthusiasm about finishing the first season of ""veronica mars"" and praising the character keith mars as a great tv dad. the comparison to cliff huxtable (a well-known beloved tv father figure) suggests sincere admiration rather than sarcasm. the use of hashtags and the positive tone reinforce that this is likely a straightforward, non-sarcastic expression of appreciation for the show and its characters.",0

About as relevant as Michael Sam and Jason Collins. RT @eonline: Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott comes out as gay.,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""about as relevant as"" suggests a comparison, but doesn't immediately indicate positive or negative sentiment. the tweet is reporting on a news item about a major league baseball umpire coming out as gay.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the full context:
1. the tweet starts with ""about as relevant as michael sam and jason collins."" this is a comparison to other athletes who have come out as gay.
2. the use of ""about as relevant as"" suggests that the speaker doesn't consider this news to be particularly important or noteworthy.
3. by comparing it to other athletes coming out, the speaker is implying that this news is not significant or doesn't deserve attention.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention appears to be dismissive of the news. the speaker is using sarcasm to express that they don't think this information is relevant or important. the sarcasm lies in the seemingly neutral reporting of the news while actually implying that it's unimportant.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to downplay the significance of the news about dale scott coming out as gay, by sarcastically comparing it to other similar announcements that the speaker apparently considers irrelevant.",1
Getting Final Jeopardy correct on Kids Jeopardy boosts my self-esteem,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll think through this step-by-step to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""boosts my self-esteem"" indicate a feeling of accomplishment and improved confidence.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely self-deprecating humor. the speaker is implying that they feel accomplished for getting a question correct on a children's version of a quiz show, which is typically much easier than the regular adult version.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the surface positivity and the implied self-deprecation creates the sarcastic tone. the speaker is not genuinely proud of this ""accomplishment,"" but rather poking fun at themselves for finding validation in something that should be easy for an adult.

the juxtaposition of adult self-esteem with success on a children's game show is the key to the sarcasm here. it's a subtle way of saying, ""i'm not very smart if i need to compete with children to feel good about myself.""

therefore, the statement is classified as sarcastic.",1
itsfunny bc people think im quiet|but im just listening toeveryones convos|and figuring out ur weaknesses|todestroy u later in life #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems negative and somewhat threatening. key phrases like ""figuring out ur weaknesses"" and ""todestroy u later in life"" give an ominous tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely humorous rather than threatening. the exaggerated nature of the statement, the casual language style (e.g., ""bc"", ""ur""), and especially the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end all indicate this is meant to be a joke rather than a serious statement.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the stark contrast between the seemingly threatening surface content and the likely humorous intention, coupled with the explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic post. the author is playfully exaggerating the stereotype of a quiet person as someone who is secretly plotting against others.

therefore, the label is decidedly ""sarcastic"".",1
"Woke Up , showered , made a lunch and got ready for work only to realize that I have the whole weekend off. 😅",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems slightly negative or frustrated. the person describes doing a series of tasks typically associated with preparing for work, only to realize it wasn't necessary. the use of the sweating smile emoji (😅) at the end suggests some embarrassment or sheepishness about the situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be sharing a humorous, relatable moment of absent-mindedness. the author is likely amused by their own mistake and wants to share this amusing anecdote with others. the emoji reinforces this light-hearted, self-deprecating tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a slight disconnect between the initial actions (preparing for work) and the realization (having the weekend off), this doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the author is simply recounting a genuine mistake in a humorous way. the emoji and the overall tone suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine, humorous recounting of a personal experience rather than a sarcastic statement.",0
@bencasselman @davidmwessel @PaulKrugmanBlog @TheDailyShow @DemocracyNow How many of those jobs earn #middleclass wages? #Economics #Math #Z,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the tweet is asking a question about how many jobs earn middle-class wages, using hashtags like #economics and #math. there are no overtly positive or negative words, but the questioning tone could imply some skepticism.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be raising doubt about the quality of jobs being created. by asking how many of these jobs actually pay middle-class wages, the author is implying that many may not. the inclusion of media outlets like @thedailyshow and @democracynow, which often provide critical commentary, further suggests a skeptical stance.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the underlying intention appears to be questioning or critiquing job quality. however, this critique is presented as a straightforward question rather than using typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or irony. the tone is more of genuine inquiry or subtle criticism rather than sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be asking a genuine, albeit potentially critical, question about job quality without employing sarcastic techniques.",0
I reckon straight women fancy victoria secret models more than straight men do #victoriasecret #irony,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward observation about attraction patterns. there are no explicitly positive or negative words, and no clear emotional indicators.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet suggests that the author intends this statement to be understood as ironic or sarcastic. the statement itself challenges a common assumption (that straight men would be more attracted to victoria's secret models than straight women).

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text seems like a simple observation, the inclusion of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the author intends this to be understood as sarcastic. the statement itself subverts expectations, which is a common feature of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the nature of the statement strongly indicate that this is intended to be sarcastic.",1

@NormanWalshUK Stunning work. #british #textiles #footwear #madeinbritain #not-a-nike-clone,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. keywords like ""stunning work"" indicate praise and admiration. the hashtags #british, #textiles, #footwear, #madeinbritain suggest pride in british-made products.

step 2: true intention
however, the last hashtag #not-a-nike-clone stands out as unusual and contradictory. this suggests the tweet might be mocking the product for resembling nike shoes despite claims of being uniquely british. the use of ""stunning work"" in this context could be exaggerated praise meant ironically.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the initially positive sentiment and the final sarcastic hashtag, along with the potentially exaggerated praise, strongly suggests this tweet is not genuinely complimentary. the author seems to be using irony to criticize the product for lacking originality despite claims of being distinctly british.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention appears to be criticism delivered through sarcasm, particularly evident in the contradictory final hashtag.",1
@PotPolitics @foxnewspolitics Sent it but too slow. I had already posted.,0,"not sarcastic

@GlobalGrind Niagra Falls tho... Really? #irony #LOL,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be one of amusement or disbelief, indicated by the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) and the hashtag ""#irony"". the phrase ""really?"" also suggests surprise or questioning.

step 2: the true intention of this tweet seems to be mocking or ridiculing the idea of niagara falls being considered as a notable topic. the use of ""tho..."" (though) implies a dismissive tone, as if the author finds it absurd or unimpressive that niagara falls is being discussed.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment of amusement with the underlying dismissive tone, we can infer that this tweet is indeed sarcastic. the author is using irony to express their real opinion, which is contrary to what might be expected when discussing a famous natural wonder like niagara falls. the explicit use of the hashtag ""#irony"" further confirms this interpretation.

"If we win against Poland and Scotland, does that put us 65th in the world rankings. @YouBoysInGreen @FAIreland #Sarcasm",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the text asks about improving world rankings after potential wins against poland and scotland. the use of ""we"" suggests support for the team. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate this is likely not a genuine question:
1. the specific ranking of ""65th"" seems oddly precise and low for a national team aiming to improve.
2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly signals the sarcastic intent.
3. the question format is often used in sarcasm to make a point indirectly.

the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing the team's poor performance or low ranking, suggesting that even with wins against decent opponents, the improvement would be minimal.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface text appears to be a neutral or positive question about rankings, the true intention is to sarcastically comment on the team's poor standing. the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag removes any doubt.

### label: sarcastic",1

this tweet appears to be a straightforward news headline about a legal case involving myanmar men pleading not guilty to the murder of british tourists. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the text. the language is neutral and informative, typical of news reporting. the hashtags and link to reuters further suggest this is a factual news item rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
"Since the tribunal was established 14 years ago, no complaint against the intelligence services has ever been upheld. #trustthesystem #not",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. the statement presents a fact about the tribunal's history without explicitly negative language. the hashtag ""#trustthesystem"" seems to express support or confidence in the system.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, several elements suggest the true intention is critical or skeptical:
1. the fact that no complaint has been upheld in 14 years is presented in a way that implies this is unusual or concerning.
2. the hashtag ""#trustthesystem"" is followed by ""#not"", which completely reverses its meaning.
3. the use of hashtags in this context often indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (neutral to positive) contrasts sharply with the true intention (critical and skeptical). the use of ""#not"" deliberately contradicts the seemingly positive ""#trustthesystem"", creating a clear sarcastic tone. the statement about no complaints being upheld is presented as a fact that speaks for itself, implying that this is not a positive reflection on the system.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony and contradiction to criticize the effectiveness or fairness of the tribunal system, making it clearly sarcastic.",1
@LadySandersfarm: Garner protesters chant 'F*ck Fox News' despite Fox agreeing with them http://t.co/GWIS4hZAI6 #EricGarner #Irony,1,"i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet contains the phrase ""f*ck fox news"" which expresses a strong negative sentiment towards fox news. the hashtag #irony is also used, suggesting a potential contradiction or unexpected situation.

step 2: true intention
the tweet is pointing out that protesters are chanting against fox news despite fox news apparently agreeing with their position on the eric garner case. the use of ""#irony"" indicates that the author finds this situation contradictory or paradoxical.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (anger towards fox news) doesn't align with the underlying situation (fox news agreeing with the protesters). the author is highlighting this contradiction and explicitly labeling it as irony. this misalignment between the protesters' actions and the actual situation, coupled with the author's commentary, suggests a sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is using irony to point out the contradictory behavior of the protesters, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the explicit mention of irony and the highlighting of the paradoxical situation strongly indicate a sarcastic intent.",1
"@TheOliverStone After 1989, why did NATO need to expand?",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. it's a straightforward question about nato expansion after 1989, directed at oliver stone. there are no obvious sentimental keywords, phrases, or emojis that would indicate sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the question seems to be genuine inquiry about nato's motivations for expansion after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989. the context of addressing oliver stone, known for his political documentaries and sometimes controversial views, suggests this could be part of a serious discussion about geopolitics and military alliances.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the question seems straightforward and aligned with a genuine desire for information or perspective on a historical and political topic.

### label: not sarcastic

this question appears to be a sincere inquiry about nato's expansion post-cold war, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.",0
The #Irony of playing this song on my way to #work |#NoMoney #PartTimeCooks blackmossptc thanks for... http://t.co/n9b7T2Xj84,1,"given the content of the tweet, i'll analyze it step-by-step to determine if it's sarcastic:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. key elements:
- ""#irony"" suggests a contradictory situation
- ""#nomoney"" indicates a lack of funds
- ""parttimecooks"" might imply a struggle to make ends meet

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention appears to be highlighting a contradiction or ironic situation:
- the person is listening to a song (likely about money or success) while going to work
- the hashtags suggest they don't have much money and are working part-time
- the use of ""#irony"" explicitly points out the contradictory nature of the situation

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
- the surface sentiment doesn't directly express strong emotions, but the true intention is to point out an ironic situation
- the use of ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author is aware of and emphasizing the sarcastic nature of the situation
- the contrast between listening to a song (possibly about wealth) and the reality of having ""#nomoney"" and working part-time further supports the sarcastic tone

### label: sarcastic

the explicit use of ""#irony"" combined with the contrasting elements in the tweet strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic statement.",1
You are taking your responsibilities so seriously today that i... More for Leo http://t.co/HJ6TebH4o6,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""taking your responsibilities so seriously"" which normally indicates praise or approval.

step 2: true intention
however, there are some elements that suggest this may not be entirely sincere:
1. the ellipsis (...) after ""that i"" suggests an unfinished thought or a pause, which can sometimes indicate sarcasm.
2. the abrupt shift to ""more for leo http://t.co/hj6tebh4o6"" seems disconnected from the first part, possibly indicating that the first part wasn't meant to be taken at face value.
3. the tweet format and link at the end suggest this might be a horoscope or daily prediction, which often use vague positive statements that can be interpreted sarcastically.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the structure and context of the tweet suggest that it may not be entirely sincere. the disconnected nature of the two parts of the tweet, along with the ellipsis, hints at possible sarcasm.

however, without more context or a clearer indication of tone, it's difficult to be entirely certain whether this is genuinely sarcastic or just an oddly structured positive statement.

given the analysis, i'm leaning towards classifying this as sarcastic, but with less than 90% confidence.

### label: sarcastic",1
@RozieBreen @CllrKWakefield @tomriordan @GaryVerity @BBCLeedsif we get it right for business the trickle down fairy will do the rest #NOT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""get it right for business"" and ""trickle down fairy will do the rest,"" which sound optimistic about economic policies benefiting everyone.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is actually critical and skeptical:
1. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating the previous statement.
2. the phrase ""trickle down fairy"" is a mocking reference to trickle-down economics, implying disbelief in this economic theory.
3. the overall tone is exaggerated and dismissive, suggesting the author doesn't actually believe what they're saying.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment appears positive, the true intention is clearly to criticize and mock the idea of trickle-down economics. the use of sarcasm is evident, especially with the ""#not"" hashtag serving as an explicit marker of sarcastic intent.

can you not understand that not EVERYTHING is about the President? @RBRNetwork1 @goteamslots @BrianBullinger @jtarleta53,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be frustration or annoyance. the use of ""can you not understand"" and the all-caps ""everything"" suggests irritation. there are no positive keywords or emojis to counterbalance this.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker appears genuinely frustrated that others are relating everything to the president. the rhetorical question ""can you not understand"" is likely meant to emphasize this frustration rather than to be sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the frustration expressed appears genuine, and there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration or irony.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
When you're in the doctors waiting room and hear a baby in the back screaming her lungs out is always a reassuring feeling #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""reassuring feeling"" suggests a positive sentiment on the surface.

step 2: true intention
the context of a screaming baby in a doctor's waiting room is generally considered unpleasant and anxiety-inducing. the use of ""always"" exaggerates the situation, and the hashtag ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the preceding statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""reassuring feeling"") sharply contrasts with the actual unpleasant situation described. the exaggeration and the ""#not"" hashtag confirm that the speaker means the opposite of what they're literally saying.

therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to express that a screaming baby in a doctor's waiting room is actually distressing, not reassuring at all.",1
"Well now the festive season has begun, let's take a moment to reflect on how much more royalties Slade and Wizard will get #sarcasm",1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""let's take a moment to reflect"" typically introduces a thoughtful or appreciative statement. the mention of ""more royalties"" for slade and wizard (presumably referring to popular christmas song artists) seems to suggest a positive outcome for them.

step 2: however, the true intention is likely the opposite. the author is using irony to criticize the overplaying of certain christmas songs. by sarcastically suggesting we should reflect on the artists' increased royalties, they're actually expressing frustration with hearing these songs repeatedly during the holiday season.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. this mismatch is a hallmark of sarcasm. furthermore, the use of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end of the text explicitly confirms the sarcastic nature of the statement.

given this analysis and the explicit sarcasm tag, i can confidently label this text as ""sarcastic"".",1

MB forgot to move the elf on shelf and now 10 is asking me if Christmas is real. 😥@NannyProbss,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or sad. the use of the crying emoji (😥) at the end indicates distress or worry. the phrase ""mb forgot"" suggests a mistake, and the question about christmas being real implies a potentially upsetting situation for a child.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be sharing a genuine parenting concern or mishap. the tweet appears to be a sincere expression of a parent's (or caregiver's) worry about their child questioning the reality of christmas due to forgetting to move the ""elf on the shelf"" (a popular christmas tradition).

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy or irony. the negative sentiment aligns with the genuine concern expressed. there are no evident rhetorical devices or language style that would suggest sarcasm. the tweet seems to be a straightforward expression of a parenting dilemma.

### label: not sarcastic

WATCH: #Megatron from #Transformers Rant About Social Media http://t.co/M9F1MWufXH #Irony,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the tweet is encouraging people to ""watch"" something, which typically indicates interest or recommendation. the use of hashtags like #megatron and #transformers suggests enthusiasm for pop culture references.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the full context:
- megatron is a villainous character from transformers, known for being destructive and anti-human.
- the tweet mentions megatron ranting about social media.
- the hashtag #irony is explicitly used at the end.

this suggests that the tweet is actually pointing out a humorous contradiction: a fictional, technologically advanced alien robot complaining about human social media technology.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of enthusiasm clashes with the implied absurdity of the situation. the explicit use of #irony confirms that the tweet is meant to be taken as a joke or commentary on the ironic nature of the content.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the use of irony and the juxtaposition of a futuristic alien robot complaining about human technology clearly indicates sarcastic intent in this tweet.",1
@playstation @sony #not #working when are we able to download games we paid in good faith? #psn start working again? http://t.co/MVSikoFvBl,0,"let's approach this step by step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and frustrated. key indicators:
- ""#not #working""
- ""when are we able to download games we paid in good faith?""
- ""#psn start working again?""
these phrases suggest dissatisfaction and impatience with a service not functioning as expected.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. the user is genuinely expressing frustration and seeking information about when they can access games they've purchased. the question is direct and seems to stem from real concern about service issues.

step 3: compare and analyze
in this case, the surface sentiment and true intention are consistent. there's no apparent contradiction or irony that would indicate sarcasm. the user is straightforwardly expressing dissatisfaction and seeking information about a service problem.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet is a direct expression of frustration and inquiry about playstation network issues, without any evident sarcastic undertones or irony.",0
I just wrote a 13 page paper... I was awfully tired when I was writing it and now I can't sleep. #irony,1,"let me think this through step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems mixed. the person wrote a long paper, which could be seen as an accomplishment. however, they mention being ""awfully tired"" and unable to sleep, which are negative feelings. the use of ""..."" suggests a pause or trailing off, potentially indicating exhaustion or frustration.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or irony about the situation. the author explicitly uses the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end, which is a strong indicator that they're pointing out a contradictory or unexpected situation – likely the fact that they're too tired to sleep after finishing a long, tiring task.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is mixed, the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the contradiction between being tired from writing but then unable to sleep strongly suggest that the author is being sarcastic. they're likely commenting on the irony of the situation in a humorous or exasperated way.

given this analysis, i can confidently say:

### label: sarcastic

the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the contradictory situation described make it clear that this is a sarcastic statement.",1

"or a trout, or northern pike|@brownbearmike1 @RBRNetwork1 @Anan_VII @Dolphin__Man @Graves9",0,"since the given input text lacks clear context or obvious sarcastic elements, i'll think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text ""or a trout, or northern pike"" followed by several twitter handles doesn't convey any clear sentiment on the surface. it appears to be a neutral statement about types of fish, possibly part of a larger conversation.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or intention behind mentioning these fish types. the text seems to be a straightforward continuation of a conversation, possibly about fishing or fish species.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of obvious sarcastic markers, wordplay, or incongruity between surface meaning and true intention, there's no strong evidence to suggest this is a sarcastic statement.

based on this analysis, i would classify this as:

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a simple, non-sarcastic mention of fish types within a broader conversation. however, it's important to note that without full context, this classification is made with limited confidence.",0

There's no better way to start the week than to get your wisdom teeth taken out at 8 am!!! #not ☺😊?1,1,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""no better way to start the week"" and the use of exclamation marks and positive emojis (☺😊). the phrase ""there's no better way"" typically indicates something highly desirable.

step 2 (true intention):
however, getting wisdom teeth removed is generally considered an unpleasant and painful experience. it's unlikely that anyone would genuinely consider this the best way to start a week, especially at 8 am on a monday. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous statement is meant to be taken oppositely.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the reality of the situation, coupled with the ""#not"" hashtag, strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using exaggerated positive language to highlight how unpleasant the situation actually is.

therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1
The most exciting way to start a Friday: a presentation on structurally deficient bridges. #sarcasm #lobbyinglife,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses sarcasm to convey that a presentation on structurally deficient bridges is actually a boring way to start a friday, despite describing it as ""the most exciting way."" 

key indicators of sarcasm:

1. the extreme positive phrase ""most exciting"" contrasts with the mundane topic of ""structurally deficient bridges.""

2. starting a friday (typically associated with fun and relaxation) with a technical presentation is implied to be undesirable.

3. the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic.

4. the hashtag #lobbyinglife suggests this is part of a job the author finds tedious or dull, despite the ""exciting"" claim.

these elements create a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention, which is the essence of sarcasm.",1
New shirt #new #shirt #im #sorry #its #just #i #literally #do #not #care #at #all http://t.co/4L8inLJg9N,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""new shirt"" suggests a straightforward statement about acquiring a new item of clothing. the numerous hashtags don't convey strong emotion on their own.

step 2: true intention
the excessive use of hashtags, especially ""#im #sorry #its #just #i #literally #do #not #care #at #all"", suggests a different intention. this exaggerated string of hashtags contradicts the idea of sharing about a new shirt, implying that the author is mocking the act of posting about trivial things on social media.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the simple ""new shirt"" statement and the elaborate, contradictory hashtags reveals the sarcastic nature of the post. the author is using irony to criticize or make fun of people who post mundane updates on social media, pretending to care about something (a new shirt) while explicitly stating they don't care at all.

### label: sarcastic

the post uses irony to mock social media behavior, making it a clear example of sarcasm.",1

the surface sentiment appears extremely positive and enthusiastic. key indicators include:
- ""hahahaha!!"" (laughter)
- ""sooo funny!""
- ""#hilarious""
- use of all caps for emphasis
- exclamation marks

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, several elements suggest this might not be genuinely enthusiastic:
- overuse of capitalization and exclamation marks feels exaggerated
- ""oops.......i'm addicted"" suggests a mock confession
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates sarcastic intent
- promoting to follow for ""hilarious"" and ""sarcasm"" tweets implies the content is meant to be taken ironically

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, the true intention appears to be mocking or criticizing overly enthusiastic social media behavior. the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" is a clear indicator that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of the #sarcasm hashtag, combined with the exaggerated enthusiasm and mock confession, strongly indicates that this text is indeed sarcastic.",1
@BBCiPlayer @EndorProds @mrmichaelball absolutely loved it! Well done all involved!,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be genuinely positive and appreciative. the exclamation marks, use of ""absolutely loved it!"", and ""well done all involved!"" indicate sincere enthusiasm and praise. there are no apparent contradictions or ironic elements that would suggest sarcasm. the direct and straightforward nature of the compliment, along with tagging the relevant accounts, further supports that this is a genuine expression of enjoyment and congratulations.",0
"@lnritter_ That was the case, not the recording.So comparing the two is apple & oranges.",0,"not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the text is stating a factual disagreement with a previous statement, using the idiom ""apples and oranges"" to emphasize the perceived inappropriateness of the comparison.

step 2: the true intention appears to be a straightforward correction or clarification of information. the author is pointing out that two things being compared (presumably in a previous conversation) are not actually comparable, using a common idiom to reinforce this point.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no discrepancy between the surface meaning and the true intention. the statement is direct and literal, without any indicators of irony or sarcasm. the use of the idiom is conventional and not employed in a way that suggests sarcasm.

therefore, i confirm the label as ""not sarcastic"". the text appears to be a genuine attempt to correct a misunderstanding or inappropriate comparison, without any sarcastic undertones.",0
Wow...lol||Need cash in your hands today? Go to http://t.co/Mn8psbZpFH||#workfromhome #not #wun #not #mca... http://t.co/2ST4Esm0xK,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet doesn't appear to contain sarcasm. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit somewhat spammy, advertisement for a work-from-home opportunity. the ""wow...lol"" at the beginning might be an attempt to grab attention, but it doesn't create a sarcastic tone for the rest of the message. the hashtags and link are typical of promotional social media posts. while the quality or legitimacy of the offer might be questionable, the intent appears to be sincere rather than sarcastic.",0
At least I don't have to clean the floor,0,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears slightly positive or neutral. the phrase ""at least"" typically indicates finding a silver lining or positive aspect in a situation. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disappointment about a situation, likely where something has been spilled or made a mess. the speaker is sarcastically pointing out a minor ""benefit"" of what is probably an overall negative situation.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment appears mildly positive, the true intention seems to be expressing frustration through sarcasm. the speaker is likely not actually happy about not having to clean the floor, but rather upset about whatever has happened that's made cleaning unnecessary (e.g., a broken item, spilled liquid, etc.).

given this analysis, i believe the statement is sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
Incidentally the foreword for movie #BhopalAPrayerForRain is by Subroto Roy Sahara - saying - justice delayed is justice denied. #Irony,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll walk through my reasoning to explain this classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the tweet mentions a foreword for a movie, quoting ""justice delayed is justice denied,"" which is typically seen as a principled stance. the use of hashtags like #bhopalaprayerforrain and #irony doesn't immediately suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the key to understanding the true intention lies in the context and the use of ""#irony"" at the end. the movie ""bhopal: a prayer for rain"" is about the 1984 bhopal gas tragedy, one of the world's worst industrial disasters. the mention of subroto roy sahara, who has faced legal issues, writing a foreword about justice being delayed is where the irony comes in.

step 3: analysis and inference
the author is pointing out the irony (which is a form of sarcasm in this context) of someone who has been involved in legal controversies writing about justice being delayed. the use of ""incidentally"" at the beginning also suggests that the author finds this juxtaposition noteworthy and ironic.

the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms that the author intends this tweet to be read as sarcastic commentary on the situation.

therefore, based on this analysis, the tweet is classified as ""sarcastic"". the author is using irony to highlight what they perceive as hypocrisy or contradiction in the situation.",1
@RadiNabulsi Our 3 losses followed bye weeks & an FCS team. Do we get rid of those next year? #sarcasm,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the tweet mentions ""3 losses"" and asks about getting rid of bye weeks and fcs team games, which could be seen as a suggestion for improvement.

step 2: the true intention of this tweet is sarcastic. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the author is not being serious. the question ""do we get rid of those next year?"" is not a genuine suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment implying that these factors (bye weeks and fcs team games) are not the real reason for the losses.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it's clear that this tweet is sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the idea that scheduling is responsible for the team's losses, rather than the team's performance itself.

### label: sarcastic",1
#AskSuperwomanLIVE if you could swim in any liquid besides water what would you swim in?@IISuperwomanII |4,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward question directed at a social media personality (superwoman, aka lilly singh) during a q&a session. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the text. the question is asking about a hypothetical scenario in a playful manner, which is typical for fan interactions with celebrities, but it doesn't contain any sarcastic elements.",0
One of the most embarrassing losses @GoPittFootball Ever. #WTF,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of frustration and disappointment about a football game loss by pitt (university of pittsburgh). the use of ""embarrassing"" and the hashtag ""#wtf"" (what the f***) indicate real negative emotions without any apparent irony or sarcasm.

the author seems to be directly criticizing the football team's performance, calling it ""one of the most embarrassing losses ever."" this aligns with typical fan behavior when their team performs poorly, expressing sincere disappointment rather than employing sarcasm.

the straightforward language and the use of a common expression of frustration (#wtf) further support that this is a genuine sentiment rather than a sarcastic comment. there are no indicators of irony or hidden meanings that would suggest sarcasm is at play here.",0
@ProFootballTalk untrue - its Cutler's fault,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward disagreement or correction. the use of ""untrue"" indicates a direct contradiction to something previously stated. the phrase ""it's cutler's fault"" seems to be assigning blame to someone named cutler.

step 2: true intention
however, upon closer inspection, this tweet appears to be employing sarcasm. the context is crucial here:
1. the tweet is directed at @profootballtalk, likely a sports news account.
2. jay cutler, a former nfl quarterback, was often criticized and blamed for his team's failures.
3. the phrase ""it's cutler's fault"" became a running joke in nfl circles, used sarcastically to blame cutler for anything negative, even when he wasn't involved.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears to be a simple disagreement, the true intention is likely to mock the tendency to blame cutler for everything. the use of ""untrue"" followed by a statement blaming cutler is a classic sarcastic structure, where the speaker pretends to correct someone only to offer an absurd alternative.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet employs sarcasm by playfully suggesting that whatever issue is being discussed is actually cutler's fault, which is a common joke in nfl fandom.",1
#Malala Yousufzai receives #NobelPeacePrize and #Pakistan ranks in top 10 dangerous countries !!! #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and celebratory due to:
- malala yousufzai receiving the nobel peace prize
- the use of exclamation marks (!!!)
- the hashtag #nobelpeaceprize

step 2: true intention
however, there are several clues that suggest a different underlying meaning:
- the juxtaposition of malala's achievement with pakistan ranking in the top 10 dangerous countries
- the use of the hashtag #irony, explicitly indicating that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value
- the exclamation marks (!!!) could be read as exaggerated or overly dramatic, hinting at sarcasm

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between malala's international recognition for peace efforts and pakistan's dangerous ranking creates a sense of irony. the author is likely using sarcasm to highlight this contradiction and potentially criticize pakistan's overall situation despite producing a nobel peace prize winner.

the explicit use of #irony further confirms the sarcastic intent.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis clearly points to this tweet being sarcastic, using the juxtaposition of positive and negative elements about pakistan to make a point through irony.",1
http://t.co/cbS3YfyKGw #Not so Ugly Christmas Sweater red with red snowflakes & sequins cardigan 1X XL http://t.co/Cy19OKfojm,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward product description or advertisement for a christmas sweater. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the text simply describes the sweater's features (red with red snowflakes and sequins, cardigan style) and size (1x xl), along with a link to view the product. the hashtag ""#not so ugly christmas sweater"" suggests that this is meant to be a more attractive version of the typically ""ugly"" christmas sweaters, but this is not sarcastic - it's just a marketing angle. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate for this input.",0
Testing water temperatures #excitingtimes #Not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive or neutral. ""testing water temperatures"" is a neutral statement. the hashtag ""#excitingtimes"" suggests enthusiasm or excitement.

step 2: true intention
however, the addition of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous sentiment is being negated or contradicted. this is a common way to express sarcasm online, where people state something seemingly positive and then immediately contradict it with ""not"" to show they mean the opposite.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly excited ""#excitingtimes"" and the contradictory ""#not"" creates a sarcastic tone. the author is implying that testing water temperatures is actually not exciting at all, but rather boring or mundane. they're using sarcasm to humorously highlight how unexciting this activity is.

given this analysis, the text is clearly sarcastic. the use of contradictory hashtags, particularly ending with ""#not,"" is a strong indicator of sarcastic intent in online communication.",1
Waking up with your cat attacking your hand is always delightful..... #not,1,"i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the word ""delightful"" which is typically a positive descriptor
- the ellipsis (....) which can sometimes indicate a dreamy or positive trailing off

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
- the situation described (cat attacking hand) is generally considered unpleasant
- the use of ""always"" is likely hyperbolic
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the previous statement

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""delightful"") sharply contrasts with the actually unpleasant situation described. the ""#not"" hashtag confirms that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying. this stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
"May not have hung out with you as much as some people, but every time we did it was a blast! You... http://t.co/Ikgz8u9Fos",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of appreciation for time spent together, without any indicators of sarcasm. the phrase ""it was a blast"" is a positive sentiment expressing enjoyment, and the overall tone seems sincere and friendly. there are no contradictory elements or subtle hints that would suggest sarcasm is being employed here.",0
@SenWarren the #USA is #NOT a #Democracy. The #USA is a #Republic from of #Goverment! Do you #Know #what the #Pledge of #Allegiance say's?,0,"given the nature of this tweet, i believe i can confidently classify it without going through the step-by-step process.

label: not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, albeit forceful, expression of the author's political views. the use of capitalization and hashtags emphasizes key points, but there's no indication of irony or sarcasm. the author is directly challenging senator warren's understanding of the us government system, asserting that the us is a republic rather than a democracy. this kind of direct political statement is common on social media and doesn't exhibit the hallmarks of sarcasm, such as saying one thing while meaning another or using humor to mock or criticize.",0
I blame my mom. Mother of the Year #sarcasm,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet ""i blame my mom. mother of the year #sarcasm"" is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the juxtaposition of ""i blame my mom"" with ""mother of the year"" creates an ironic contrast.

2. the use of ""mother of the year"" is typically a positive phrase, but here it's being used in a context of blame, which signals sarcasm.

3. most importantly, the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end removes any doubt about the author's intent.

the surface sentiment appears negative (""i blame""), but is then contrasted with a seemingly positive title (""mother of the year""). the true intention is to criticize or express frustration with the mother's behavior, using sarcasm to emphasize this point. the hashtag confirms the sarcastic nature of the statement.

therefore, this tweet is unambiguously sarcastic.",1
Pulling my books out to prepare to organize my new bookshelves caused me to forget to bring my book today. #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the author is describing a situation where they forgot to bring their book because they were organizing their bookshelves. the use of ""#irony"" at the end suggests the author finds this situation ironic.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to point out the irony of the situation. the author finds it amusing that in the process of organizing their books, they actually forgot to bring a book they needed. the hashtag ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author is highlighting this contradiction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the addition of ""#irony"" shifts the tone of the statement. the author is using this label to draw attention to the contradictory nature of their actions. this use of irony to highlight a contradictory or unexpected outcome is a common form of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" to explicitly point out the contradictory nature of the situation, combined with the implicit self-mockery of forgetting a book while organizing books, strongly indicates that this statement is intended to be sarcastic.",1
"@GlenjiUTLR @JoshStevo95 To be fair, you didn't use the mandatory #sarcasm hashtag :P",0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears lighthearted and playful, with the use of ""to be fair"" and the "":p"" emoji.

step 2: the true intention is to humorously point out the absurdity of needing a ""#sarcasm"" hashtag to indicate sarcasm. the phrase ""mandatory #sarcasm hashtag"" is itself sarcastic, as there's no actual requirement for such a hashtag.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that the comment is using irony to make a point about sarcasm. the author is sarcastically suggesting that sarcasm should always be explicitly labeled, which goes against the nature of sarcasm itself.

therefore, the comment is clearly sarcastic in nature, poking fun at the idea of needing to explicitly label sarcasm.",1
"'I like the hope Jan Ellis writes with, the precision of the prose, and also the #humour and #irony she brings.' http://t.co/mevDxiqijg",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine compliment about an author named jan ellis. the sentiment is positive throughout, praising various aspects of ellis's writing including hope, precision, humor, and irony. there are no indications of sarcasm or contradictory elements that would suggest the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying. the use of hashtags for #humour and #irony seems to be highlighting genuine qualities of the writing rather than indicating sarcasm in the tweet itself. the inclusion of a link also suggests this is a straightforward recommendation or review of the author's work. therefore, i can confidently classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0
Girls just wanna have fun#work#not#friends#only#dance#drinks#antennagrouprocks by mariag... http://t.co/7vN6UqpvQE http://t.co/hVxMXRdktM,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward statement about girls wanting to have fun, likely referencing the popular song by cyndi lauper. the hashtags and linked content suggest it's promoting some kind of social event or party. there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm or irony in the text. the message seems to be genuinely celebrating the idea of girls having fun through dancing, drinks, and socializing, without any hidden or contradictory meaning.",0
"The Bay Area storm is so big that tons of people's work was canceled today, causing me to be early to mine. #irony #stormageddon",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the text mentions work being canceled for many people due to a big storm, which is often seen as a good thing (unexpected day off). the phrase ""causing me to be early to mine"" also seems positive on the surface, as being early is generally viewed favorably.

step 2: true intention
however, there are several clues that suggest this isn't straightforward:
1. the hashtag #irony is used, explicitly indicating that the situation is ironic.
2. the hashtag #stormageddon suggests an exaggerated, humorous take on the storm's impact.
3. the fact that the speaker was early to work because others' work was canceled implies an unexpected and somewhat absurd outcome.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (positive about being early) contrasts with the implied frustration of having to go to work when many others don't. the use of irony and exaggeration, coupled with the explicit #irony hashtag, strongly suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their true feelings about the situation.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the surface sentiment might seem positive, the true intention is to humorously highlight the irony of the situation using sarcasm.",1
@pattistanger I'm from the UK and I honestly think your a goddess! I love how you speak your mind but have a gentle side. #love #PattiKnows,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of admiration and appreciation for patti stanger. the language used is straightforward and positive, without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the user directly compliments patti, calling her a ""goddess"" and expressing love for her personality traits. the use of hashtags like #love and #pattiknows further reinforces the sincerity of the message. there are no contradictory elements or subtle hints that would suggest sarcasm, so this can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0
Leaving whilst its dark is fun. #not,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment of the text appears to be positive. the word ""fun"" is used to describe leaving while it's dark, which typically conveys a positive emotion.

step 2: however, the true intention of this statement is likely the opposite. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the speaker means the opposite of what they've just said. this hashtag is commonly used to denote sarcasm or irony, especially when the preceding statement is meant to be understood as untrue.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (positive) with the true intention (negative) revealed by the ""#not"" tag, we can conclude that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is using irony to express that leaving while it's dark is actually not fun at all.

### label: sarcastic",1
@YasminaBen1 please note #sarcasm in last tweet before you kill yourself ;) many good pros including @BalancePhysio can show you best usage,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed or slightly positive:
- use of ""please note"" and winky face emoticon "";)"" seem friendly
- phrase ""many good pros"" is positive
- ""can show you best usage"" sounds helpful

step 2: true intention
however, several elements suggest this is actually sarcastic:
- explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag
- ""before you kill yourself"" is an extreme, dark statement that contrasts sharply with the otherwise friendly tone
- the winky face "";)"" after a reference to suicide further indicates the author isn't being sincere

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the explicit #sarcasm tag, combined with the jarring contrast between the seemingly helpful tone and the reference to suicide, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic statement. the author is likely mocking the idea of seeking professional help for proper twitter usage, using dark humor to emphasize their point.

given these factors, especially the explicit sarcasm tag, i can confidently label this as sarcastic.",1
@rioferdy5 my mum to be back with us for Xmas 🎄,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, sincere expression of hope or anticipation about a family member returning for christmas. there are no indications of sarcasm or hidden meaning. the use of the christmas tree emoji (🎄) reinforces the genuine sentiment about the holiday reunion.",0
"@RealFrnkPhister Even though @PGA_JohnDaly's got more ex-wives than @PGATour majors, I'm happy for that washed-up mess... #Not!! #Blocked",1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance. the phrase ""i'm happy for that washed-up mess"" seems to express happiness or support. however, there are several negative elements: ""washed-up mess,"" ""more ex-wives than majors,"" and the hashtags ""#not!!"" and ""#blocked.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly negative and mocking. the use of ""washed-up mess"" is a direct insult. comparing ex-wives to majors is a jab at both daly's personal life and professional career. the ""#not!!"" is a clear indicator that the previous statement was not meant sincerely. ""#blocked"" further reinforces the negative sentiment.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of happiness sharply contrasts with the true negative intention. the use of seemingly positive language followed by ""#not!!"" is a classic sarcastic structure. the tweet is designed to mock and insult john daly while pretending to be supportive on the surface.

### label: sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. it uses a false positive statement followed by clear indicators of the opposite intention, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message about making money through tweeting, without any discernible sarcastic elements. the content is typical of spam or marketing messages shared on social media platforms, presenting a seemingly genuine (though likely dubious) opportunity to earn money. there are no indicators of irony, mockery, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.",0
Take me tooooo church #not,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or enthusiastic. ""take me to church"" is a phrase that could indicate eagerness or desire to attend church. the elongated ""tooooo"" adds emphasis, potentially increasing the apparent enthusiasm.

step 2: true intention
several elements suggest this might not be sincere:
1. the exaggerated ""tooooo"" could be mocking enthusiasm rather than expressing it.
2. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to indicate the opposite of what was just said, implying sarcasm.
3. ""take me to church"" is also the title of a popular song, which might be referenced here in a non-literal way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text seems positive about going to church, the ""#not"" hashtag directly contradicts this. this deliberate contradiction between the statement and the hashtag is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the exaggerated spelling of ""tooooo"" further supports this interpretation, as it can be read as an over-the-top, insincere enthusiasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
"A 'republican move' which will 'effectively rob the royals'. Kate's spending 32k on1meal, who is being robbed? #irony http://t.co/OTbeWggbTJ",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""republican move"", ""effectively rob the royals"", and ""who is being robbed?"" suggest disapproval and criticism of royal spending. the use of quotation marks around certain phrases adds emphasis and potential skepticism.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out the irony or contradiction in the situation. the tweet mentions kate spending 32k on a meal while simultaneously referring to the royals being ""robbed"". the hashtag #irony explicitly signals the author's intent to highlight this contradiction. the question ""who is being robbed?"" appears rhetorical, implying that no one is actually being robbed given the extravagant spending.

step 3: comparison and final inference
comparing the surface criticism with the true intention of highlighting irony, it's clear that the author is using sarcasm. they're not genuinely concerned about the royals being robbed, but rather using this claim sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of considering the royals as victims while they engage in lavish spending. the explicit use of #irony further confirms the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

### label: sarcastic",1
#obama @DemocratWire announce special urgent package for #Pakistan .. supported by @GOP to enhance their fight against obscurantists. #NOT,1,"to analyze this tweet for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears positive. it mentions obama announcing a ""special urgent package"" for pakistan, supported by the gop, to ""enhance their fight against obscurantists."" this seems like a positive collaborative effort.

step 2 (true intention):
several elements suggest this is not meant to be taken at face value:
1. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm.
2. the phrasing ""special urgent package"" sounds exaggerated.
3. the claim of gop support for an obama initiative is unlikely given the political climate.
4. ""obscurantists"" is an unusual term that seems out of place in a genuine announcement.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention is to mock or criticize. the ""#not"" hashtag explicitly negates the entire statement, revealing it as sarcastic. the exaggerated language and unlikely political cooperation further support this interpretation.

### label: sarcastic

the clear use of ""#not"" and other contextual clues strongly indicate that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1

"how is it possible that somebody so interesting is also so, so, so boring? #irony #what",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is mixed. the phrase ""so interesting"" is positive, but it's immediately contrasted with ""so, so, so boring,"" which is strongly negative. the repetition of ""so"" emphasizes the boringness. the hashtag ""#irony"" is a direct indicator of potential sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be to express that the person is actually boring, despite an initial suggestion of being interesting. the question format and the stark contrast between ""interesting"" and ""boring"" create a rhetorical effect. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the statement should not be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment presents a contradiction (interesting vs. boring), which is a common sarcastic technique. the true intention seems to be to emphasize how boring the person is, using the contrast for effect. the hashtag ""#irony"" confirms the sarcastic intent.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
"@Pier1984_ Not going this time, we might have a chance! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..... #fuckthat",0,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. ""not going this time, we might have a chance!"" initially sounds positive, suggesting hope. however, the phrase ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice....."" and the hashtag ""#fuckthat"" indicate frustration or negativity.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disappointment. the speaker is likely referring to past experiences where they were let down or disappointed. the use of the proverb ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..."" implies they've been fooled before and are reluctant to be fooled again.

step 3: analysis and inference
comparing the initially positive-sounding ""we might have a chance!"" with the overall negative tone of the rest of the message, it becomes clear that this is sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to express their disbelief or lack of faith in a positive outcome. they're essentially saying that by not going, they ironically have a better chance of success, which is a sarcastic way of expressing their lack of confidence in the situation.

the use of the hashtag ""#fuckthat"" further emphasizes their negative feelings and reinforces the sarcastic tone of the entire message.

therefore, the final classification is sarcastic.",1
@dzmilner Minky Wale tail fritter for price of a bijoux flat in Port Talbot.,0,"i'll approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly positive. there are no clearly positive or negative words, emojis, or sentimental phrases. the text appears to be describing a food item (minky wale tail fritter) and comparing its price to that of a small flat in port talbot.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be highlighting an absurd or exaggerated price comparison. ""minky wale tail fritter"" is likely a made-up or unusual dish, and comparing its price to that of real estate (a ""bijoux flat"") in a specific location (port talbot) suggests an intentional exaggeration or absurdity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface neutrality contrasts with the underlying absurdity of the comparison. the use of an unlikely food item and the extreme price comparison indicate that the speaker is not being literal. instead, they are using hyperbole and absurd juxtaposition to make a point, likely about high prices or economic disparities.

given this analysis, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to comment on prices or economic issues.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. words like ""first,"" ""proudly,"" and ""putting journalism first"" suggest a positive view of ibn live's actions. the hashtag #nlprimetime also seems to highlight their primetime coverage.

step 2: true intention
however, several elements suggest this is not the true intention:
1. the tweet criticizes cutting to ads during primetime, which contradicts ""putting journalism first.""
2. the use of quotation marks around ""putting journalism first"" implies skepticism.
3. the hashtag #irony explicitly signals that the opposite of what's being said is meant.

step 3: comparison and final analysis
the surface positive sentiment contrasts sharply with the true critical intention. the tweet is using irony to mock ibn live's claim of prioritizing journalism while actually prioritizing advertisements. the explicit use of #irony confirms this interpretation.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is clearly using sarcasm to criticize ibn live's actions, contrasting their claims with their actual behavior.",1
".@ChrisBrett2 @/RBRNetwork1 @GaryBlackal @DiveConLFP I think it's your white skin. Or ""racist DNA"". He's a geneticist too, did ya know? #not",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be serious or accusatory. key phrases like ""white skin"", ""racist dna"", and claiming someone is a geneticist seem to be making strong statements about race and genetics.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate this is not meant to be taken at face value:
1. the use of quotation marks around ""racist dna"" suggests skepticism about this concept.
2. the phrase ""he's a geneticist too, did ya know?"" seems exaggerated and mocking.
3. most importantly, the ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the preceding statement is meant to be taken as the opposite of what was said.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text makes seemingly serious claims about race and genetics, the true intention is to mock and satirize these ideas. the ""#not"" hashtag is a decisive indicator that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying, which is a classic sarcastic device.

### label: sarcastic

the use of exaggeration, mockery, and especially the ""#not"" hashtag clearly indicate that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
#hi #good #morning #instadaily #snapchat #selfie #comment # #sleep #do #not #wake #up @ Happy http://t.co/PTs2oMnYy6,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text contains mostly neutral hashtags like #instadaily, #snapchat, #selfie. it ends with ""#sleep #do #not #wake #up @ happy"". the word ""happy"" at the end could indicate a positive surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the series of hashtags ""#sleep #do #not #wake #up"" followed by ""@ happy"" creates a contradiction. the instruction not to wake up is contrasted with being happy, which is typically associated with being awake and active.

step 3: analysis and inference
the juxtaposition of ""do not wake up"" with ""happy"" suggests a possible sarcastic tone. it's as if the poster is sarcastically implying that happiness comes from not waking up, which is contrary to conventional wisdom.

given this analysis, i believe there's a good chance this is sarcastic, but it's not entirely clear-cut. the use of many neutral hashtags at the beginning makes it somewhat ambiguous.

### label: sarcastic

i've chosen ""sarcastic"" as the label, but i acknowledge there's some uncertainty in this classification due to the mixed signals in the text.",1
I JUST WANT TO BE DONE WITH FINALS #4hoursleft,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of frustration and anticipation about finishing final exams. the all-caps text ""i just want to be done with finals"" conveys a strong, sincere sentiment of wanting the exams to be over. the hashtag ""#4hoursleft"" further reinforces this as a literal countdown, expressing relief that the ordeal is nearly finished.

there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement. the sentiment expressed on the surface aligns with the likely true intention of the speaker, which is to communicate their eagerness for their finals to be over soon.",0
"1 bed flat #ToLet £550 pcm (£127 pw)|Humphrey Middlemore Drive, Harborne, #Birmingham B17|http://t.co/QHYcB5zKEv",0,"not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the input text appears to be a straightforward property listing for a flat to rent. it contains factual information about the property (1 bed flat), the price (£550 pcm), location (harborne, birmingham), and includes a link for more details. there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or any attempt at humor. this is a typical format for a real estate or rental listing shared on social media, likely twitter given the character limitations and use of hashtags.",0
So there used to be a crossfit place here.... #irony #pizzawins http://t.co/9BDkxT9GFJ,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the text simply states a fact about a crossfit place that used to be somewhere. the hashtag #pizzawins suggests a positive sentiment towards pizza.

step 2: the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the hashtag #irony. this suggests that the author is pointing out a contradiction or unexpected turn of events. the implication is that a pizza place has replaced a crossfit gym, which is ironic given that these two establishments have opposing associations with health and fitness.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that while the surface text doesn't immediately appear sarcastic, the use of the #irony hashtag and the implied contrast between a fitness-focused business being replaced by a pizza place reveals the sarcastic nature of the tweet. the author is using situational irony to make a humorous observation about the change in establishments.

### label: sarcastic

the use of #irony, the implied contrast between crossfit and pizza, and the overall tone of the tweet strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic statement.",1
When I start singing songs from Once More With Feeling to myself while at work... #Buffymusical #stuckinmyhead,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward statement about the person singing songs from ""once more with feeling"" (which is an episode of the tv show buffy the vampire slayer known for its musical numbers) to themselves while at work. the hashtags #buffymusical and #stuckinmyhead support this interpretation. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in this message. the person seems to be genuinely expressing that they have these songs stuck in their head and find themselves singing them at work.",0
"I'm heading off, but need to say this! ""Just because I am concerned for my country, and it's people-Does #NOT make me a racist! #Terrorists",0,"not sarcastic

this statement does not appear to be sarcastic. the author seems to be expressing a genuine concern and frustration about being labeled as racist for expressing concerns about their country. the use of capital letters for emphasis (not) and the hashtags (#terrorists) suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm. the tone is defensive and direct, which is more consistent with a non-sarcastic statement in this context.",0

this quote appears to be a genuine piece of motivational advice rather than sarcasm. it encourages people to work diligently without seeking attention, and let their achievements speak for themselves. there are no indicators of irony or sarcasm in the phrasing or sentiment. the message is straightforward and aligns with common wisdom about the value of hard work and humility.",0
@MJibranNasir @SaminaSays now what has he said/done??,0,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as my confidence is not very high:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be curiosity or concern. the question ""now what has he said/done??"" suggests the speaker is asking for information about someone's actions or words. the double question marks could indicate increased interest or urgency.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. this appears to be a genuine question seeking information about what a particular person (referred to as ""he"") has said or done recently. the context suggests this is part of an ongoing conversation where the participants are discussing someone's behavior or statements.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the question appears straightforward and sincere, without any indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with reasonable confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine inquiry without any sarcastic undertones.",0
Watching Alison Jackson's portfolio of work #eurobest2014 seems she's cracked it. Celebrity + stunt = #viral #sarcasm,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a reliable classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""seems she's cracked it"" suggests success or achievement. the equation ""celebrity + stunt = #viral"" implies a successful formula for viral content creation.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are several clues that suggest the true intention is sarcastic:
1. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end is a direct indicator of sarcastic intent.
2. the oversimplification of viral content creation (celebrity + stunt = #viral) seems to mock the idea rather than praise it.
3. the phrase ""seems she's cracked it"" could be read as overly simplistic or dismissive when considering complex topics like viral marketing.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment appears positive, the true intention is clearly sarcastic. the use of the #sarcasm hashtag is the most obvious indicator, but even without it, the tone and oversimplification suggest a mocking attitude towards the subject. the contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the underlying critical tone is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
Spending the majority of my day in and out of the doctor has been awesome. #sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

this input can be directly classified as sarcastic due to several clear indicators:

1. the statement uses positive language (""awesome"") to describe an obviously unpleasant experience (spending most of the day at the doctor's).

2. the contrast between the negative experience and the positive description is a classic sarcastic technique.

3. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly labels the statement as sarcastic.

given these clear markers, especially the explicit sarcasm tag, we can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic without needing to go through a step-by-step analysis.",1
@anthonyboutall - p.s. strong tweet. particularly Horatio's involvement in the matters #bloodlinecontinues xxx,0,"since this tweet doesn't have obvious indicators of sarcasm and requires more context to fully understand, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases:
- ""strong tweet""
- ""xxx"" (often used as kisses, indicating affection)
the overall tone seems appreciative and friendly.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however:
- the mention of ""horatio's involvement"" could be a reference to something specific that might change the interpretation.
- the hashtag ""#bloodlinecontinues"" is ambiguous and could potentially be used ironically.

step 3: analysis and inference
given the limited information and lack of clear sarcastic indicators:
- the tweet appears to be a genuine compliment to anthony boutall.
- the reference to horatio and the hashtag don't provide enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic.
- the overall friendly tone and straightforward compliment suggest sincerity.

based on this analysis, i would lean towards labeling this as ""not sarcastic"". however, i acknowledge that without full context, there's a possibility of missing subtle sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic",0
@TheStarPhoenix #spnews #yxe I hope you weren't driving when you took that picture. #irony,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be concern or hope, as indicated by the phrase ""i hope you weren't driving when you took that picture."" this seems like a genuine expression of worry for safety.

step 2: true intention
however, the inclusion of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet suggests that the true intention is not genuine concern, but rather to point out a contradiction or hypocrisy. the author is likely implying that the person they're addressing was, in fact, driving while taking the picture, which would be dangerous and irresponsible.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of concern contrasts with the true intention of calling out potentially dangerous behavior. the use of ""i hope"" followed by ""#irony"" is a classic sarcastic structure, where the stated hope is actually the opposite of what the author believes to be true.

given this analysis, we can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to criticize the potentially dangerous act of taking pictures while driving, making it a clear example of sarcasm.",1
My beautiful Belles #3daughters#lucky #me #havefun @ Wicklow 🌁 http://t.co/efbHmmLgEw,0,"not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this tweet appears to be a genuine, heartfelt expression of affection and gratitude from a parent towards their daughters. the use of positive words like ""beautiful"" and hashtags like ""#lucky"" and ""#me"" indicate sincere sentiment. the inclusion of a location (wicklow) and a photo link suggests this is a real-time update about a pleasant family moment.

there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden negative meanings. the tone is straightforward and celebratory. therefore, i classify this as ""not sarcastic"" with high confidence.",0
"@Tesco Yeah thanks for messing me about and then not delivering on the product, i feel really great about how this went down!! #Not #Thanks",1,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""yeah thanks"" and ""i feel really great about how this went down!!"" along with exclamation marks suggesting enthusiasm.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly negative. the context indicates tesco failed to deliver a product and ""messed about"" the customer. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#thanks"" are strong indicators that the thanks is not genuine. the excessive exclamation marks also hint at exaggeration typical of sarcasm.

step 3: there's a clear mismatch between the surface positive sentiment and the underlying negative sentiment. the author is using positive language to express their dissatisfaction, which is a classic sarcastic technique. the hashtags further confirm the sarcastic intent.

therefore, this tweet is clearly sarcastic, using false praise to criticize tesco's poor service.",1
"@folieadang aha, but white girl drinks make me 'so so cray tipsy'",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is somewhat subtle here:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or playful. the use of ""aha"" suggests agreement or realization, and ""so so cray tipsy"" sounds like an exaggerated but fun description of being intoxicated.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are clues that suggest this might not be sincere:
- the phrase ""white girl drinks"" is often used stereotypically or mockingly.
- the exaggerated language ""so so cray tipsy"" seems to be mimicking a particular way of speaking, rather than the speaker's natural voice.
- the use of quotation marks around 'so so cray tipsy' indicates that the speaker is quoting or imitating someone else's words, not expressing their own genuine feelings.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears positive, the true intention seems to be mocking or making fun of stereotypical ""white girl"" behavior and speech patterns when drinking. the exaggerated language and use of quotation marks suggest that the speaker is not sincerely describing their own experience, but rather sarcastically imitating someone else.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that this tweet is indeed sarcastic, using exaggerated language and stereotypes to mock a certain type of behavior associated with drinking.",1
This is definitely me! 😁|#me #sarcastic #sarcasm #ecards #ecard #somecard #tease #funny #lol... http://t.co/Q1joezvW9u,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet explicitly includes the hashtags #sarcastic and #sarcasm, which are clear indicators that the content is intended to be sarcastic. additionally, the presence of tags like #funny and #lol suggests humorous intent.

the phrase ""this is definitely me!"" followed by a grinning emoji (😁) is likely meant ironically, especially when combined with the sarcasm tags. this type of self-deprecating humor is a common form of sarcasm on social media.

the mention of ""ecards"" and ""somecard"" also hints at the type of content being shared - these platforms are often used for humorous, sarcastic, or ironic messages.

given these clear indicators, especially the explicit sarcasm tags, we can confidently classify this tweet as sarcastic.",1
Christmas alone😊 how nice #not,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the use of ""nice"" as a positive adjective
- the smiling emoji 😊
these elements suggest a positive surface sentiment about spending christmas alone.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
- the phrase ""christmas alone"" typically has negative connotations, as most people prefer company during holidays
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to negate the preceding statement, indicating the opposite meaning
- the juxtaposition of ""alone"" with ""nice"" creates an unexpected pairing that hints at irony

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""nice"" and 😊) contrasts sharply with the likely true negative feeling about being alone on christmas. the use of ""#not"" confirms that the statement is meant to be read opposite to its literal meaning. this stark contrast between apparent meaning and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the text uses positive language and emojis to express a actually negative sentiment about being alone on christmas, employing sarcasm to convey this message.",1
work Wednesday-Sunday .. #yay #not #moneytho 😩😭💰😒,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""#yay"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- however, this is immediately followed by ""#not"", which negates the positive sentiment.
- ""#moneytho"" implies a focus on money, which could be positive.
- the emojis used (😩😭💰😒) are predominantly negative, expressing exhaustion, crying, and annoyance. the money bag emoji (💰) is neutral in this context.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""work wednesday-sunday"" indicates a long work week, which is generally viewed negatively.
- the use of ""#yay"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, where the author is pretending to be excited about something they actually dislike.
- ""#moneytho"" suggests that while the long work hours are undesirable, the compensation is a silver lining, but the following negative emojis imply that even this isn't enough to make up for the unpleasant schedule.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment initially appears positive with ""#yay"", but this is quickly and deliberately contradicted by ""#not"" and the negative emojis. the true intention is to express dissatisfaction with the work schedule, using sarcasm to emphasize this point. the contrast between the fake enthusiasm (""yay"") and the real feelings (expressed through ""not"" and negative emojis) is a classic sarcastic structure.

### label: sarcastic",1
@LariatOfHestia: Gavy is one rude motherfucker. *Subtweets me* *Calls me a motherfucker* #Irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of the phrase ""rude motherfucker""
- mentioning subtweets, which are often used for indirect criticism
- the hashtag #irony, which suggests the tweet itself may not be straightforward

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the user is pointing out inconsistent behavior from gavy
- gavy apparently called the user a ""motherfucker"" while subtweeeting (indirectly criticizing)
- the #irony hashtag is likely highlighting this contradiction in gavy's behavior

step 3: comparison and final inference
- the surface negativity doesn't match the true intention, which is to highlight ironic behavior
- the use of ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the tweet is meant to be understood as sarcastic
- the tweet is constructed to point out the irony in gavy's actions, not to genuinely insult

based on this analysis, i can confidently classify this as:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to highlight the irony in gavy's behavior, rather than being a straightforward insult.",1
"Access to housing is not a fundamental human right, according to Ontario courts: http://t.co/ykf7vB53RM #onpoli #TOpoli #cdnpoli",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward statement reporting on a court decision in ontario, canada. while the topic is serious and potentially controversial, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the language used. the tweet is presenting factual information and includes hashtags for relevant political discussions, which is typical for non-sarcastic news sharing on social media.",0
"@DuaneBougard: Been friendzoned too many times in my life, the perks of being the good guy #Sarcasm #Lifeall my life this has happened",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""been friendzoned too many times"" and ""the perks of being the good guy"" suggest frustration or disappointment. the hashtag ""#lifeall my life this has happened"" reinforces a sense of ongoing struggle.

step 2: true intention
however, the inclusion of ""#sarcasm"" is a direct indicator that the true intention is not aligned with the surface sentiment. the phrase ""the perks of being the good guy"" is likely meant ironically, as being friendzoned is not typically considered a perk. the author is using sarcasm to express frustration with the ""nice guy"" stereotype and its perceived lack of romantic success.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is negative, the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" and the ironic use of ""perks"" clearly indicate that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic. the author is using sarcasm to comment on their experiences of being ""friendzoned"" despite being a ""good guy.""

### label: sarcastic

the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag, combined with the ironic content, makes this a clear case of sarcasm.",1
@manicsue: You want to see something Irish!!Of all the reasons to be closed 😂😂😂 http://t.co/ePyGvA9pwU #irony,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive or amused, indicated by the laughing emojis (😂😂😂) and the exclamatory tone (""you want to see something irish!!"")

step 2: the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disbelief at an absurd situation. the phrase ""of all the reasons to be closed"" implies that the reason for closure (which we can't see but is likely shown in the linked image) is ridiculous or unexpected. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be taken ironically or sarcastically.

step 3: comparing the surface amusement with the underlying frustration or criticism, along with the explicit use of ""#irony"", strongly suggests this tweet is sarcastic. the author is using humor and apparent amusement to highlight something they find absurd or worthy of criticism.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
And then my sister should be home from college by time I get home from babysitting. And it's payday. THIS IS A GOOD FRIDAY,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be genuinely positive and not sarcastic. the author is listing several good things happening on their friday:

1. their sister is coming home from college
2. they're finishing babysitting
3. it's their payday

the capitalized ""this is a good friday"" at the end reinforces the positive sentiment and seems to be a sincere expression of happiness about these events coinciding. there are no apparent contradictions or ironic undertones that would suggest sarcasm. the tone is straightforward and excited about the day's positive aspects.",0
"Oh dear, some people don't get #irony 😳",0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of mild surprise or concern, indicated by:
- ""oh dear"" - an expression of concern
- ""😳"" - wide-eyed surprised emoji

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be ironic commentary on people's inability to understand irony:
- ""#irony"" - explicitly mentions irony
- ""some people don't get"" - implies that the speaker does understand, unlike others
- the combination of a seemingly concerned tone with the hashtag creates a mismatch

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the tweet is using irony to comment on people's lack of understanding of irony. the surface-level concern is actually mocking those who don't grasp irony. by using the hashtag #irony and then immediately demonstrating irony in the tweet itself, the author is creating a meta-joke.

therefore, this tweet is clearly sarcastic, using irony to make its point about irony.",1
Yay for Fire Alarms at 3AM #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet ""yay for fire alarms at 3am #not"" is clearly sarcastic. the surface sentiment appears positive with the enthusiastic ""yay,"" but this is immediately contradicted by the undesirable situation of fire alarms going off at 3 am. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a common indicator of sarcasm, explicitly signaling that the preceding statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning.

the juxtaposition of the fake enthusiasm with the annoying situation, combined with the ""#not"" tag, makes this a textbook example of sarcasm. the author is expressing frustration or annoyance at being woken up by fire alarms, using sarcasm to emphasize how unwelcome this event is.",1
"I just drank a healthy, homemade, all fruit smoothie...in a @Budweiser beer glass. #irony",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the person is describing a ""healthy, homemade, all fruit smoothie,"" which typically has positive connotations.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to point out the irony of drinking a healthy smoothie from a beer glass. the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly states this. the contrast between the healthy drink and the container associated with alcohol consumption is deliberate and meant to be humorous.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the juxtaposition of the healthy smoothie with the budweiser beer glass, combined with the explicit ""#irony"" hashtag, clearly indicates that this is a sarcastic statement. the author is purposefully highlighting the contradiction for comedic effect.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the use of rhetorical questions (""should i buy these? and become a full time hipster?""), followed by ""lol!"" and ""#not....."" are strong indicators of sarcasm. the speaker is mocking the idea of becoming a ""full time hipster"" and using exaggerated language to express their disinterest or disdain for whatever item is shown in the linked image. the hashtag ""#not"" is a particularly explicit marker of sarcasm, emphasizing that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.",1
Just paid $2.59 for gas! #ThanksObama #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""just paid $2.59 for gas!"" could be read as expressing satisfaction with a low gas price.

step 2: however, the true intention is sarcastic criticism. several clues indicate this:
- $2.59 for gas is actually quite expensive in most contexts.
- the hashtag ""#thanksobama"" is often used sarcastically to blame obama for negative things, even when he's not responsible.
- the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag directly signals the sarcastic intent.

step 3: comparing the surface positivity with the underlying criticism, and considering the explicit sarcasm tag, this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the author is actually complaining about high gas prices while mockingly thanking obama.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll briefly break down my reasoning:

2. however, the true intention is revealed by:
   - the context that mondays are typically disliked
   - the explicit #sarcasm hashtag

3. the contrast between the seemingly positive statement and the common dislike for mondays, combined with the explicit sarcasm tag, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic statement.

this tweet appears to be a straightforward comment about someone's observation of seth rollins (assuming this is referring to the professional wrestler) being angry. the phrase ""was so pissed off"" is a direct expression of anger, and the ""haha"" at the end suggests the commenter found this amusing or entertaining, which is common when discussing dramatic moments in wrestling. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement; it seems to be a genuine reaction to an event or scene involving rollins.",0

@SurianibteAbu if it got the attention of the smartass to comment that.. Didnt it work anyway?? #irony,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or confrontational, with phrases like ""smartass to comment"" and the use of ""didnt it work anyway??"" which sounds challenging.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is actually to point out that the comment achieved its purpose, despite being potentially viewed as sarcastic or smartass-like. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the tweet itself is meant to be ironic or sarcastic.

step 3: analysis and final label
the surface sentiment and the true intention don't align perfectly, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the author is using a somewhat aggressive tone to actually defend the effectiveness of the original comment. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
When you're sick and you feel bad for your cells cause they're fighting hard for you. #blessed #appreciative #sarcasm #kinda,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and appreciative. key phrases like ""feel bad for your cells cause they're fighting hard for you"" and hashtags like ""#blessed"" and ""#appreciative"" suggest a genuine sentiment of gratitude and concern.

step 2: true intention
however, the inclusion of ""#sarcasm"" directly indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the addition of ""#kinda"" at the end further complicates the interpretation, suggesting that while there might be an element of sarcasm, it's not entirely sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" is a strong indicator that the statement is intended to be sarcastic, despite the seemingly positive surface sentiment. the ""#kinda"" suggests that while the overall intent is sarcastic, there might be a slight element of truth or genuine feeling mixed in.

given this analysis, and the presence of the explicit sarcasm hashtag, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the text is primarily sarcastic, even if there might be a hint of genuine sentiment underlying it.",1

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key indicators:
- ""i think #not"" suggests dissatisfaction
- use of sad emoji "":-(|""
- hashtags like ""#damn"", ""#suck"", and ""#sob!"" express frustration and disappointment

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the author appears to be genuinely frustrated with their shading attempt:
- they're asking for feedback (""does this look properly #shaded??"")
- the hashtags indicate they're learning (#learning) and struggling (#techniques, #3d, #view)
- the self-deprecating tone (""i #suck"") suggests genuine disappointment

step 3: compare and analyze
there's no apparent disconnect between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the frustration and disappointment seem genuine, and there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm. the author appears to be honestly expressing their dissatisfaction with their work and seeking feedback.

Just realized my last final is tomorrow. FAAAAA-,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key indicators:
- ""faaaaa-"" suggests frustration or dismay
- ""just realized"" implies sudden awareness of something undesirable
- mentioning ""last final"" tomorrow suggests stress or anxiety about an impending exam

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. the person seems genuinely distressed about:
- the realization coming late (possibly feeling unprepared)
- the exam being tomorrow (little time to prepare)
- it being their last final (potentially high stakes)
the truncated ""faaaaa-"" likely represents a drawn-out exclamation of frustration, possibly ""faaack"" or similar.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention align. there's no indication of irony or mismatch between what's said and meant. the exaggerated expression ""faaaaa-"" emphasizes the genuine frustration rather than introducing sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of stress or frustration about an upcoming exam, without any sarcastic undertones.",0
@ambika1900 @sankrant @CChristineFair @JTMondal @Al_Muwa7id Christian Europe translated Islamic manuscripts #Irony http://t.co/0hXEQig7hM,1,"to analyze this tweet for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet doesn't contain obvious sentimental words or emojis. it appears to be a factual statement about christian europe translating islamic manuscripts, with a hashtag #irony.

step 2: true intention
the inclusion of the #irony hashtag is a key indicator here. it suggests that the author finds something ironic about the situation described. the irony likely stems from the historical context of christian-islamic relations, implying that it's unexpected or contradictory for christian europe to translate islamic texts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text appears neutral, the use of the #irony hashtag introduces a layer of commentary that suggests the author is pointing out a contradiction or unexpected situation. this use of irony to comment on a historical fact is a form of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to make a point about the relationship between christian europe and islamic scholarship, which is a subtle form of sarcasm. the hashtag #irony is the key indicator that transforms what could be a straightforward statement into a sarcastic comment.",1
Aaaaaand now I've found out that Chrome slows down downloads when the screen saver activates. Just makes me love it more #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification because:

1. the tweet uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly, which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be read as sarcastic.

2. the phrase ""just makes me love it more"" contrasts with the negative situation described (chrome slowing down downloads), which is a classic sarcastic structure.

3. the elongated ""aaaaaand"" at the beginning suggests a tone of exasperation, which aligns with the sarcastic intent.

4. the content describes a frustrating situation (software behaving poorly), which is often a context for sarcasm.

these elements together provide strong evidence that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic, making the classification straightforward in this case.",1
The fact that this time next week I'll be getting my wisdom teeth out 😖🙊 #chipmunk,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or anxious. this is indicated by:
- the phrase ""getting my wisdom teeth out"" which suggests a dental procedure
- the use of worried/nervous emojis: 😖 (confounded face) and 🙊 (speak-no-evil monkey)
- the hashtag ""#chipmunk"" likely refers to swollen cheeks after the procedure
these elements suggest apprehension or discomfort about the upcoming event.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the author is expressing genuine concern or nervousness about their upcoming wisdom teeth extraction. the use of ""the fact that"" emphasizes the reality of the situation, and the countdown (""this time next week"") adds to the sense of impending discomfort.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the author is straightforwardly expressing their feelings about an upcoming dental procedure. the language is direct, and the emojis and hashtag reinforce the message rather than contradict it.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the text expresses genuine concern about an upcoming wisdom teeth extraction without any indicators of sarcasm or irony.",0
@Wallace17_daKid Way to lay out yesterday and put it all on the line #GoodLeader #Sarcasm,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""way to lay out yesterday and put it all on the line"" and hashtags like ""#goodleader"". these suggest praise and admiration for someone's efforts.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is actually negative:
1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly states the tweet is sarcastic.
2. the exaggerated praise ""way to lay out yesterday and put it all on the line"" seems overly dramatic, potentially mocking.
3. the contrast between the praise and the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag creates irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment clearly contradicts the true negative intention revealed by the sarcasm hashtag. the tweet is using praise ironically to criticize or mock the person's performance or leadership.

### label: sarcastic

the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" and the clear contradiction between surface sentiment and true intention make this classification highly confident.",1
Two years later & gingerbread house making still makes me cry.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the phrase ""makes me cry,"" which typically indicates sadness or distress.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, this sentence doesn't seem to employ any obvious rhetorical devices or sarcastic language. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration or difficulty with gingerbread house making, even after two years of experience. the use of ""still"" suggests a genuine, ongoing struggle with this activity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (negative) aligns with the likely true intention (expressing genuine frustration). there's no apparent contradiction or irony that would indicate sarcasm. the statement seems to be a sincere expression of difficulty with a holiday craft activity.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
Amar Singh gives A+ rating to the Modi govt but Arun #Shourie says more is said than done in present govt #Irony #Politics,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. amar singh gives an ""a+ rating"" to the modi government, which is very positive. however, arun shourie's comment that ""more is said than done"" is critical. the hashtag #irony is also present, which often indicates sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting a contradiction or inconsistency. the tweet is juxtaposing two contrasting viewpoints about the same government. the use of the #irony hashtag suggests that the author is pointing out this contradiction deliberately, implying that one or both of these views might not be entirely genuine or accurate.

step 3: analysis and inference
the juxtaposition of the conflicting views, combined with the explicit use of #irony, strongly suggests that the tweet is meant to be taken sarcastically. the author is likely using these contrasting opinions to criticize the government or highlight the inconsistency in its public perception.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of conflicting viewpoints, the use of the #irony hashtag, and the overall structure of the tweet pointing out a contradiction all support the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1
@ardhow @Jmroberts343Jmr @Squarehighways |Thats a twist|Algorithms to cause more congestion & increase pollution|Too bizarre to be true #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to phrases like:
- ""too bizarre to be true""
- ""cause more congestion & increase pollution""
these suggest criticism of the algorithms mentioned.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate sarcasm:
- ""|thats a twist|"" suggests an unexpected or ironic turn
- the idea of algorithms intentionally causing problems seems absurd, which is often a sign of sarcasm
- ""#not"" at the end is a common indicator of sarcasm, implying the opposite of what was just said

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention appears to be sarcastic criticism. the author is likely mocking the idea that traffic algorithms would be designed to cause problems, rather than solve them. the use of ""|"" to set off phrases, the extreme nature of the claim, and especially the ""#not"" tag strongly suggest sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
@JasminHadasah #sarcasm is a service I offer.,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but let me briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet explicitly mentions ""#sarcasm"" as a ""service"" the user offers. this direct reference to sarcasm, especially framed as a service, is a clear indicator that the statement is intended to be sarcastic. people who frequently use sarcasm often joke about it being a skill or service they provide, which is exactly what's happening here.

the phrasing ""is a service i offer"" adds to the sarcastic tone, as it humorously presents sarcasm as if it were a professional skill or commodity.

therefore, this tweet is self-referentially sarcastic about the speaker's use of sarcasm, making it clearly fall into the ""sarcastic"" category.",1

I'm absolutely positive that Coaches love it when parents tell them how to coach and run their program. #sarcasm #NOT #sticktoparenting,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""absolutely positive"" and ""coaches love it."" this suggests a strong affirmative statement about coaches appreciating parental input.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly the opposite. the hashtags ""#sarcasm"" and ""#not"" explicitly indicate that the statement is sarcastic. additionally, the hashtag ""#sticktoparenting"" implies that parents should not interfere with coaching, contradicting the surface meaning.

step 3: the stark contrast between the superficially positive statement and the contradictory hashtags, especially the explicit use of ""#sarcasm,"" leaves no doubt that this is a sarcastic comment. the author is actually expressing frustration with parents who try to tell coaches how to do their job.

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic.""",1

@GaryLineker trust me it will be out of form Scandinavian reef again to. @ChampionsLeague do love @MCFC I see😒🙈 #irony #FCBarcelona #mcfc,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive elements: ""love"", ""@championsleague do love @mcfc""
- negative elements: 😒 (unamused face emoji), 🙈 (see-no-evil monkey emoji)
- hashtags: #irony

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""trust me"" and ""i see"" with the unamused face emoji suggests skepticism or disbelief
- the hashtag #irony explicitly indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value
- the combination of positive words with negative emojis creates a contrast
- mentioning multiple teams (@mcfc, #fcbarcelona) in the context of champions league suggests a complex situation or rivalry

step 3: analysis and inference
the surface sentiment appears positive with the use of ""love,"" but this is contradicted by:
1. the negative emojis
2. the explicit use of #irony
3. the skeptical tone set by ""trust me"" and ""i see😒""

the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking the situation, likely implying that the champions league favors manchester city unfairly or predictably.

given these factors, especially the explicit use of #irony and the clear contrast between words and emojis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1
i literally love when someone throw me in at the deep end #irony #tough #life,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of ""literally love"" which expresses strong positive feelings. the hashtags #tough and #life could indicate some difficulty, but overall the surface sentiment seems positive.

step 2: true intention
the phrase ""throw me in at the deep end"" is an idiom that means to put someone in a challenging situation without preparation. this is generally not a pleasant experience. the use of ""literally love"" in this context is likely not meant to be taken literally. the hashtag #irony explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface positive sentiment (""literally love"") contrasts sharply with the true meaning of being put in a difficult situation unprepared. the use of exaggeration and the explicit #irony hashtag clearly indicate that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly using irony to express frustration or displeasure at being put in difficult situations without preparation, while sarcastically claiming to ""love"" it.",1
"Agree with that... #we #are #not #mind #readers #haha||#Repost 9gag ⁰You may think we are, but we are... http://t.co/PEUz57XHmD",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems somewhat mixed:
- positive elements: ""agree with that"", ""#haha""
- neutral elements: ""#we #are #not #mind #readers""
- the hashtags and structure make it difficult to determine a clear surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be making a humorous or ironic comment about people's expectations of mind reading:
- the phrase ""we are not mind readers"" followed by ""#haha"" suggests a lighthearted acknowledgment of this fact.
- the #repost from 9gag (a humor website) further indicates this is meant to be funny.
- the incomplete sentence at the end ""you may think we are, but we are..."" likely continues with ""...not mind readers,"" playing on the expectation vs. reality.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is somewhat ambiguous, the true intention appears to be making a humorous point about the impossibility of mind reading. the use of hashtags, reference to a humor site, and the playful tone suggest this is a light sarcastic comment rather than a straightforward statement.

given this analysis, i believe the most appropriate label is:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses a subtle form of sarcasm to humorously address the unrealistic expectation of mind reading in relationships or social interactions.",1
Day ninth December to have a pint at the boars head|#not really still in bed 😊 http://t.co/H4XoH4jpwc,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. there's mention of having a pint (beer) at the boar's head, which implies a pleasant social activity. the use of a smiling emoji (😊) at the end also suggests a positive mood.

step 2: true intention
however, the phrase ""#not really still in bed"" contradicts the first part of the tweet. this hashtag reveals that the person is actually still in bed, not going out for a drink. the image link at the end likely shows the person in bed or their view from bed.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the tweet sets up an expectation (going out for a drink) and then immediately contradicts it (actually still in bed). this contrast between the stated plan and the reality, along with the cheerful emoji despite not following through on the plan, indicates a self-deprecating humor.

given this analysis, i can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses a form of gentle self-mocking sarcasm by presenting a fun plan and then admitting to not actually doing it, all while maintaining a positive tone.",1
Speed cameras in Whipton by village shops. & yes it Takes 5 police officers!! 🚔 #waste #of #money #does #not #take #five #individuals 😂🚨🚓,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or critical. key indicators:
- use of exclamation marks for emphasis
- hashtags like #waste #of #money expressing disapproval
- laughing emoji 😂 and police car emojis 🚨🚓 potentially mocking the situation
- capitalization of ""takes"" for emphasis

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing what the author views as an excessive use of police resources. the author appears to be:
- pointing out the perceived absurdity of using five police officers for speed cameras
- implying that this is a waste of money and manpower
- using exaggeration and rhetorical questioning (""does not take five individuals"") to emphasize their point

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that:
- the author is using exaggeration and mockery to convey their criticism
- the laughing emoji is not expressing genuine amusement, but rather derision
- the hashtags and emojis are used ironically to emphasize the perceived ridiculousness of the situation

given this analysis, the text displays clear markers of sarcasm. the author is using irony and exaggeration to criticize what they see as an inefficient use of police resources.

Picked an excellent day to get my hair done 😒 #sarcasm,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to illustrate the thought process:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""picked an excellent day"" initially suggests a positive sentiment. ""excellent"" is typically a very positive word.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate that the true intention is negative and sarcastic:
1. the rolling eyes emoji (😒) expresses frustration or annoyance, contradicting the ""excellent"" statement.
2. the explicit #sarcasm hashtag directly labels this as sarcastic.
3. the context implies that the day chosen for getting their hair done was actually not good, likely due to bad weather or some other inconvenience.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface statement and the negative true intention, coupled with the explicit sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicates that this is a sarcastic statement.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1

Waking up with a pounding headache is just what I need for this final #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses irony by stating that a pounding headache is ""just what i need"" for a final exam, when obviously a headache would be detrimental. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end also explicitly labels this as sarcastic. the contrast between the surface positive statement and the clearly negative reality of the situation is a hallmark of sarcasm. therefore, this tweet can be confidently classified as sarcastic.",1
Can always count on you to speak to me on here then delete the messages so It looks like I'm talking to myself. 😒 @TristanReece_,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- the use of the eye-roll emoji (😒) indicating annoyance
- the phrase ""can always count on you"" which typically has a positive connotation, but is used in a context that suggests the opposite
- the implication that the speaker is left looking like they're ""talking to myself,"" which is generally not a desirable situation

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or calling out someone's behavior:
- the speaker is addressing someone (@tristanreece_) directly, suggesting this is a complaint about their behavior
- the description of deleting messages implies this is a recurring issue
- the tone is accusatory and passive-aggressive

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention:
- there's a clear mismatch between the seemingly positive phrase ""can always count on you"" and the negative behavior being described
- the use of ""can always count on you"" is clearly not meant sincerely, but rather to highlight the predictability of the undesirable behavior
- the eye-roll emoji reinforces that this statement is not to be taken at face value

given this analysis, the statement is using irony to express frustration, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

@reisawal I swear we must be twins,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious to me:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and friendly. the phrase ""i swear we must be twins"" typically indicates a strong connection or similarity between people, which is usually seen as a positive thing.

step 2: analyzing the true intention, this tweet is directed at another user (@reisawal) and seems to be a response to something they said or did. without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any sarcasm intended. the phrase ""i swear"" adds emphasis, which could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the context.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there isn't enough evidence to conclusively label this as sarcastic. the statement could be genuinely meant as a compliment or expression of similarity. without more context about the relationship between the users or the conversation leading up to this tweet, it's safer to assume it's not sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a possibility of sarcasm depending on context we don't have, based solely on the given text, it appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement.",0
Some days are just better than others..,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears slightly positive or neutral. the phrase ""some days are just better than others"" is a common expression that acknowledges variability in life experiences. the use of ""better"" suggests a positive element, though it's tempered by ""some"" which limits the scope.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this statement is likely more complex than the surface level suggests. the ellipsis ("".."") at the end adds a sense of trailing off or incompleteness, which can imply resignation, frustration, or irony. this linguistic device often suggests that there's more to the story than what's explicitly stated.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is mildly positive or neutral, the use of the ellipsis creates a subtle contrast. this contrast between the seemingly straightforward statement and the implied additional meaning suggests a potential for sarcasm. the speaker might be using this common phrase ironically to express that their day has been particularly challenging or disappointing, contrary to what the literal words suggest.

given this analysis, there's a strong possibility of sarcasm, though it's relatively subtle.

### label: sarcastic

the use of the ellipsis and the potential ironic deployment of a common phrase tip the balance towards a sarcastic interpretation, even though it's not an overt or aggressive form of sarcasm.",1
"After getting a total of 4 hours of sleep in 2 days, I FINALLY got good sleep last night😁",0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of relief and happiness about finally getting good sleep after a period of sleep deprivation. the use of capital letters in ""finally"" emphasizes the speaker's excitement, and the smiling face emoji (😁) reinforces the positive sentiment. there's no indication of sarcasm or irony in this statement; it seems to be a straightforward expression of satisfaction about improved sleep.",0
"Her name is not Superwoman, Wonder Woman, nor Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Women of Excellence https://t.co/iAFycyWIwC",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately clear to me:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the text mentions strong female figures (superwoman, wonder woman) and refers to ""women of excellence,"" which carries a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be praising a specific woman (or women in general) by saying she doesn't need to be a fictional superhero to be excellent. the statement ""her name is not superwoman, wonder woman, nor dorothy"" is used to emphasize that real women can be exceptional without being fictional characters.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, there doesn't seem to be a significant discrepancy. the text appears to be a straightforward compliment to women's capabilities, using well-known fictional characters as a point of comparison. there's no obvious irony or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the text seems to be a genuine appreciation of women's excellence without relying on fictional comparisons, rather than a sarcastic statement.",0
I didn't realize Boston Coach also operated in Chicago #irony #brands,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""i didn't realize"" suggests a lack of knowledge or surprise. there are no overtly positive or negative emotional words. the hashtags #irony and #brands are notable but not part of the main text.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out an inconsistency or unexpected situation. the author is likely aware that boston coach is primarily associated with boston, and finding it operating in chicago is surprising or contradictory to expectations. the use of ""#irony"" strongly suggests the author is deliberately highlighting this contradiction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text appears straightforward, the inclusion of ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author intends this statement to be taken as ironic or sarcastic. the apparent surprise at finding a boston-named company in chicago is likely feigned for effect. the use of ""#brands"" further emphasizes the author's commentary on brand identity and geographical associations.

given this analysis, particularly the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the implied commentary on brand expectations versus reality, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

"@MaraAzzurra89 and that ""somebody"" thought you were Padoin sister LoL !!! #SarcasmFail",0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive or amused, with ""lol !!!"" indicating laughter.

step 2: the true intention is to mock or ridicule a situation where someone mistakenly thought the person was ""padoin sister"". the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) and multiple exclamation marks is exaggerated, suggesting it's not genuine amusement but rather derision. the hashtag ""#sarcasmfail"" explicitly indicates that sarcasm was involved and failed to be recognized.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (seeming amusement) with the true intention (mockery), along with the explicit ""#sarcasmfail"" hashtag, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic comment. the tweet is poking fun at a misidentification and the failure to recognize sarcasm in a previous interaction.

therefore, the label is confidently ""sarcastic"".",1
Once again @BarackObama is re writing history re: #CubaEmbargo ! *primal scream* #tcot,0,"i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- ""*primal scream*"" indicates frustration or anger
- the phrase ""re writing history"" suggests disapproval
- the use of an exclamation mark adds emphasis to the criticism

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment:
- the tweet criticizes barack obama for allegedly misrepresenting facts about the cuba embargo
- the ""*primal scream*"" emphasizes genuine frustration
- the hashtag ""#tcot"" (top conservatives on twitter) suggests this is a sincere conservative critique

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. the tweet expresses genuine frustration and criticism without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the language is direct and the emotions seem authentic.

### label: not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of disagreement and frustration with barack obama's statements about the cuba embargo, rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
"Wow: Look what the NFL Rams player who did ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" pose has been arrested for | http://t.co/FhO7lcmvon via @po_st #ferguson",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or excited, with the opening ""wow"" and the use of ""look"" to draw attention. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be highlighting a perceived irony or hypocrisy. the tweet references an nfl player who participated in a ""hands up, don't shoot"" protest (associated with anti-police brutality movements) being arrested. the inclusion of ""#ferguson"" further contextualizes this within discussions of police conduct and racial justice.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the excited ""wow"" and ""look"" at the beginning don't align with the serious nature of the content. this mismatch, combined with the implication that the player's arrest contradicts their previous protest stance, strongly suggests sarcasm. the tweet appears to be using a mock-enthusiastic tone to draw attention to what the author likely sees as ironic or hypocritical.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the surface sentiment appears positive, the underlying intention is to point out a perceived irony, using sarcasm to emphasize the point.",1

- use of capitalization for emphasis: ""not""

step 2: true intention
despite the angry tone, there are clues suggesting this might not be entirely sincere:
- the exaggerated threat ""someone needs to stop me before i kill someone"" is likely hyperbole.
- the phrase ""love waking up in the worst fcking mood"" is contradictory - one doesn't typically ""love"" being in a bad mood.
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end suggests the opposite of what was just said.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly negative, the exaggeration and contradictory elements suggest that the speaker is not being literal. the ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the preceding statement should be interpreted oppositely. this is a classic sarcastic structure where someone says they ""love"" something they actually hate.

What to do with that old #motherboard you have laying around. #NOT http://t.co/RjtcaMq9Gz #guitarpicks,1,"not sarcastic

this tweet doesn't appear to be sarcastic. it's straightforward information about repurposing old motherboards as guitar picks, with relevant hashtags. the ""#not"" in the tweet likely refers to something else (perhaps a brand or acronym) rather than indicating sarcasm. the content seems to be genuinely sharing a creative idea for recycling electronic waste.",0
Joe Cole just casually walking past...,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward observation without any clear indicators of sarcasm. the phrase ""joe cole just casually walking past..."" seems to be describing a genuine, unremarkable event of seeing joe cole (likely referring to the former english footballer) walking by. the use of ""casually"" reinforces the idea that this is a normal, unsurprising occurrence, which doesn't suggest any sarcastic intent.

there are no obvious contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically be present in sarcastic statements. the tone is neutral and matter-of-fact, consistent with a simple report of an observation.",0
Am I the only one who finds it very stressful when the #OrionLaunch feed keeps buffering...?!,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be expressing genuine stress and frustration about a buffering video feed of the orion launch, rather than using sarcasm. the use of ""am i the only one..."" is a common rhetorical device to relate to others, and the ""...?!"" punctuation emphasizes the poster's anxiety. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention that would indicate sarcasm.",0
@dsobek No ... now someone will start a rumor of $ABBV pricing their HCV drug same or higher than $GILD #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end, which is a clear and explicit indicator that the author intends the message to be read as sarcastic. this direct labeling by the author makes the classification straightforward.

the content of the tweet also supports this:

1. it starts with ""no..."" dismissing a previous statement.
2. it then suggests an unlikely scenario (""someone will start a rumor"") about drug pricing.
3. the use of stock symbols ($abbv, $gild) and discussion of competitive pricing suggests this is related to financial markets or pharmaceutical industry commentary.

the sarcasm lies in the author implying that such a rumor would be absurd or unlikely, while presenting it as if it were a serious prediction. the ""#sarcasm"" tag confirms this interpretation.",1
Never seen the gym so packed,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""never seen"" suggests something unusual or noteworthy, and ""so packed"" implies popularity or high attendance, which is often seen as positive for a business like a gym.

step 2: true intention
this sentence is likely to be sarcastic. the context is important here. gyms are typically very crowded in january due to new year's resolutions, but this crowds often diminishes quickly. the speaker is probably commenting on this predictable pattern with a touch of irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems straightforward, the likely context and the somewhat exaggerated tone (""never seen"") suggest sarcasm. the speaker is probably implying that the gym is actually empty or much less crowded than usual, contrary to what the literal words suggest.

this input appears to be a typical social media post aimed at gaining followers and engagement, rather than expressing any sarcastic sentiment. the use of hashtags like #autofollow, #teamfollowback, and #rt2gain are common practices for users trying to increase their follower count or visibility on platforms like twitter. the excessive use of question marks and capital letters is likely meant to attract attention rather than convey sarcasm. therefore, this text can be classified as ""not sarcastic"".",0

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of gratitude and recognition for essential workers who are on duty during christmas. the message is straightforward and sincere, without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the use of emojis (globe, christmas tree, santa, snowflake, emergency vehicles) reinforces the positive sentiment and supports the literal meaning of the text. the hashtag #essentialservice further emphasizes the sincere appreciation for these workers. there's no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention, indicating that this message is not sarcastic.",0
"Wishing everyone a Happy, Healthy, and Prosperous New Year!!!",0,"not sarcastic

this input appears to be a genuine, sincere new year's wish. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the use of multiple exclamation marks emphasizes the enthusiasm and warmth of the sentiment, which is typical for holiday greetings. the message expresses positive wishes for happiness, health, and prosperity, which are common and appropriate themes for new year's greetings. without any context suggesting otherwise, this statement can be taken at face value as a heartfelt wish for others' well-being in the coming year.",0
"@Esmerodo @MonteMcNaughton @MacLeodLisa Yes, and conventional taxis drive verrrry safely. #pfft #sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the exaggerated spelling of ""verrrry"" suggests mockery.
2. the use of ""#pfft"" is an expression of dismissal or disbelief.
3. most tellingly, the author explicitly uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm"".

these elements, especially the direct labeling of the statement as sarcasm by the author, make it unambiguous that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic about the safety of conventional taxis.",1
"Just ranted on and the moment I'm about to hit send, my ipod just died. #greatmorning #NOT",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""#greatmorning"" contrasts with the frustrating situation described (ipod dying just before sending a message).

2. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a classic sarcastic device, explicitly negating the previous positive statement.

3. the overall tone is one of annoyance or frustration, yet it's paired with a seemingly positive hashtag, creating irony.

these elements strongly suggest that the author is using sarcasm to express their frustration about their morning not going well, rather than actually having a great morning. the sarcasm is quite overt in this case, particularly with the use of ""#not"".",1

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, genuine expression of excitement about a pregnancy ultrasound scan. the hashtags used (#exciting, #happy, #good) and the overall tone of the message indicate sincere positive emotions without any hint of sarcasm or irony. the context of a 30-week pregnancy scan further supports the interpretation that this is a genuine, non-sarcastic update about an important moment in the expectant parent's life.",0
@cnsnews Obama and Hillary convinced Ukraine that they would protect them if they essentially disarm. Need to keep at least one promise.,0,"to accurately classify this tweet, i'll go through the step-by-step process:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat neutral to slightly negative. key phrases like ""convinced ukraine that they would protect them"" and ""need to keep at least one promise"" suggest a critical tone towards obama and hillary's actions and commitments.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet seems to be criticizing obama and hillary clinton's foreign policy regarding ukraine. the author is implying that they made promises to ukraine about protection in exchange for disarmament, but suggests these promises weren't kept. the phrase ""need to keep at least one promise"" is particularly telling, as it insinuates that multiple promises were broken.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is not overtly negative, the underlying message is clearly critical. the last sentence, ""need to keep at least one promise,"" is the key to identifying the sarcastic nature of this tweet. it's a sardonic suggestion that implies obama and hillary have broken multiple promises, and keeping just one would be an improvement.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence that this tweet is sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
i just enjoy throwing up #not #hatethis #sick #wanna #go #to #school #for #once #take #me #away,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive based on the phrase ""i just enjoy throwing up"". the use of ""enjoy"" suggests a positive feeling towards the act of throwing up.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly negative. the hashtags provide strong context that contradicts the surface sentiment:
- #not - directly negates the previous statement
- #hatethis - explicitly states dislike
- #sick - indicates illness, not enjoyment
- #wanna #go #to #school #for #once - sarcastically implies the person would rather be at school than be sick
- #take #me #away - expresses a desire to escape the current situation

step 3: comparing the positive surface sentiment with the clearly negative true intention revealed by the hashtags, we can infer that this statement is sarcastic. the author is using irony to express their discomfort and frustration with being sick.

### label: sarcastic",1
@GazzaDowns I actually think he needs to use the youngsters in this reincarnation #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""i actually think"" suggests a sincere opinion, and ""needs to use the youngsters"" implies a constructive suggestion for improvement. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
several elements suggest the true intention may be different from the surface meaning:
1. the use of ""actually"" can sometimes indicate sarcasm, implying the opposite of what's said.
2. ""reincarnation"" is an unusual word choice in this context, potentially hinting at mockery.
3. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears positive, the inclusion of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the statement is meant ironically. this, combined with the slightly odd word choice (""reincarnation""), strongly suggests that the true intention is to mock or criticize the idea of using young players.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of the ""#irony"" hashtag is a decisive factor in classifying this as sarcastic, despite the seemingly positive surface sentiment.",1
What a golden morning. 😒 #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""golden morning"" typically indicates a positive sentiment, suggesting a beautiful or excellent start to the day. however, this is immediately followed by a rolling eyes emoji (😒) which expresses annoyance or displeasure. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end further contradicts the initial positive statement.

step 2: true intention
the combination of the positive phrase with the contradictory emoji and hashtag strongly suggests that the speaker is not actually experiencing a pleasant morning. the true intention appears to be expressing frustration or disappointment about the morning, using sarcasm to convey this sentiment.

step 3: analysis and inference
the stark contrast between the positive words and the negative indicators (emoji and hashtag) is a classic sarcastic structure. the speaker is saying one thing but clearly means the opposite. the use of ""#not"" is particularly telling, as it's often used to explicitly mark sarcastic statements online.

### label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic, using a positive phrase ironically to express a negative sentiment about the morning.",1
Sleep. SLEEP YOU STUPID IDIOT I WANNA LEAVE MY ROOM,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears angry and frustrated. the use of capital letters for ""sleep"" and the phrase ""you stupid idiot"" indicate strong negative emotions. the speaker seems to be yelling at someone or something to sleep.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is likely not actually directed at another person, but rather the speaker's own inability to fall asleep. the personification of sleep as something that can be yelled at or commanded reveals frustration with insomnia or difficulty sleeping.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is angry and directed outward, the true intention is self-directed frustration. the contrast between yelling at ""sleep"" as if it were a person who could follow commands and the reality that sleep is not something that can be forced through shouting creates a humorous and sarcastic tone. 

the speaker is using hyperbole and personification to express their frustration with not being able to sleep in a way that's intentionally over-the-top and absurd, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, this statement is classified as sarcastic. the exaggerated, personified way of expressing a common frustration (inability to sleep) creates a sarcastic tone.",1
LIBERAL/#LEFTISTS USE #RACIST/SEXIST #LABEL FOR |#DISLIKES|MSNBC host Ed Schultz said RACIST #NOT to SUPPORT demand for #MINIMUM WAGE|#SAD,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the input is complex and requires careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""liberal/#leftists use #racist/sexist #label"", ""#dislikes"", and ""#sad"" suggest a disapproving tone towards liberals and their alleged tactics. the use of capitalization and hashtags adds emphasis to these negative sentiments.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing liberals for supposedly overusing accusations of racism and sexism, particularly in the context of minimum wage discussions. the tweet appears to be defending ed schultz (likely a conservative figure) against such accusations. the overall message seems to be that liberals unfairly label those who oppose minimum wage increases as racist.

step 3: comparison and sarcasm analysis
while the tweet uses strong language and hashtags that might initially seem exaggerated or sarcastic, the overall message appears to be a straightforward criticism of liberal tactics. the capitalization and hashtag use, while emphatic, are common in political social media posts and don't necessarily indicate sarcasm. the message seems to be conveying genuine frustration rather than using irony or sarcasm to make its point.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet, while strongly worded and critical, appears to be a sincere expression of disagreement with liberal tactics rather than a sarcastic statement.",0
Read at http://t.co/HbeAb2hklW the news '#Obama: #The #American #way #of #life #is #not #a #gift',0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""american way of life"" is often used positively, and ""gift"" typically has positive connotations. there are no overtly negative words or phrases. the hashtag style (#the #american #way #of #life) doesn't inherently convey sentiment.

step 2: true intention
this appears to be a straightforward news headline or tweet reporting on a statement by obama. the quote suggests that the american way of life is something earned or worked for, rather than freely given. this could be interpreted as a call to action or a reminder of responsibility, rather than a criticism or sarcastic comment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy. the statement is presented as a factual report of obama's words, without apparent irony or contradiction. the hashtag style is likely just a formatting choice for social media visibility rather than an indicator of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward report of a statement, without indicators of sarcasm or irony. it's presenting information rather than making a contradictory or mocking statement.",0

Everyone wants the truth but nobody wants to be honest... #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or cynical. the statement points out a contradiction in human behavior, suggesting that people desire truth but are unwilling to provide it themselves. the use of the hashtag #irony at the end adds an explicit layer of commentary.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is to highlight the hypocrisy in human behavior regarding honesty and truth. by juxtaposing the desire for truth with the reluctance to be honest, the author is making a pointed observation about human nature. the use of ""#irony"" reinforces that this is meant to be a sardonic or wry commentary rather than a straightforward observation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment presents a somewhat negative observation, the true intention is to deliver this message with a layer of irony or sarcasm. the explicit use of ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author intends this statement to be taken as sarcastic or ironic commentary on human behavior.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the combination of the contradictory statement and the explicit use of ""#irony"" makes it clear that this is intended as a sarcastic observation about human nature.",1
I won't be surprised if shelling across pak border intensifies during Delhi Elections to change issues of election's. http://t.co/Ohgg9jQ6hJ,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat negative or cynical. key phrases like ""i won't be surprised"" and ""to change issues of election's"" suggest a skeptical or suspicious attitude towards potential political maneuvering.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing concern or criticism about the possibility of military actions (shelling across the pakistan border) being used as a political tool to divert attention from other election issues. the author appears to be implying that such tactics might be employed deliberately during the delhi elections.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the statement expresses a cynical view, it doesn't appear to be using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. the author seems to be straightforwardly expressing their genuine opinion or prediction. the tone is critical and suspicious, but not overtly sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement, while critical and perhaps cynical, appears to be a sincere expression of the author's concerns rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top UNLESS YOU'RE SKINNY #Shade #Sarcasm #TheMoreYouKnow,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive at first, with phrases like ""every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top."" this seems like a complimentary, body-positive message.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed by:
1. the sudden shift with ""unless you're skinny"" in all caps, which contradicts the initial positive message.
2. the use of hashtags, particularly ""#shade"" and ""#sarcasm"", explicitly indicating the sarcastic nature of the comment.
3. ""#themoreyouknow"" is often used ironically to point out contradictions or hypocrisy.

step 3: comparing the initial positive message with the contradictory follow-up and explicit sarcasm indicators, it's clear this is a sarcastic comment. the author is likely critiquing body-shaming attitudes that claim to be inclusive but exclude certain body types (in this case, skinny people).

therefore, the final classification is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1
Take a look at those calves!!! 😎😎😂😂 ladies love the calves! #not #about #the #arms #its #about... http://t.co/R7OWkjcBmq,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic. there are multiple exclamation marks, laughing and cool emojis (😎😂), and phrases like ""ladies love the calves!"" which seem to express excitement and pride.

step 2: true intention
however, there are several clues that suggest this might not be the true intention:
1. the use of excessive punctuation and emojis can sometimes indicate exaggeration or mockery.
2. the hashtags ""#not #about #the #arms #its #about..."" suggest a contrast or redirection of focus, possibly in a humorous way.
3. the inclusion of a link at the end implies there might be more context that could reveal the true meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the enthusiastic surface sentiment and the subtle hints in the hashtags, combined with the exaggerated tone, strongly suggests that this is not a genuine boast about calf muscles. instead, it appears to be a self-deprecating joke or a playful mockery of people who do brag about such things.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the surface text appears positive, the underlying intention is likely humorous and self-mocking, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1
@CaleCowan your tongue in cheek @timescolonist weigh in does nothing but instigate breed specific hate. Stick to reporting on tuques. #yyj,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as it requires careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""does nothing but instigate breed specific hate"" and ""stick to reporting on tuques"" seem to express disapproval and dismissiveness towards @calecowan's contribution.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be genuinely critical. the phrase ""tongue in cheek"" suggests the original content by @calecowan was likely meant to be humorous or not entirely serious. however, the author of this tweet appears to be seriously criticizing this approach, suggesting it promotes hate and trivializes the issue. the suggestion to ""stick to reporting on tuques"" (a type of hat) seems to be a dismissive way of saying the person should stick to less controversial topics.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the tweet uses some colorful language (""stick to reporting on tuques""), it doesn't appear to be using sarcasm. the criticism seems straightforward and genuine. the author is directly expressing their disapproval of @calecowan's approach to the topic.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet is critical and somewhat dismissive, but it appears to be expressing its message directly rather than through sarcasm.",0
"@MiddleChildSyn: You think my mom and I would get along better, she's a middle child too. #irony #middlechildsyndrome",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the tweet suggests that the speaker's mother and they might get along better because they share the trait of being middle children. the use of ""you think"" at the beginning implies agreement or consideration of this idea.

step 2: true intention
however, the inclusion of hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#middlechildsyndrome"" suggests that the true intention is different from the surface meaning. the use of ""irony"" explicitly indicates that the opposite of what's being said is true. ""middle child syndrome"" often refers to feelings of neglect or being overlooked, which contradicts the idea of getting along better.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment suggests a positive outcome, but the hashtags reveal that the speaker is actually implying the opposite. the use of irony and reference to middle child syndrome indicates that the speaker believes they would not, in fact, get along better with their mother despite both being middle children. this contradiction between the stated sentiment and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

i'm confident in this assessment for the following reasons:

1. the tweet explicitly includes the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

2. the question ""isn't this blaming the victim?"" is rhetorical and implies criticism of the linked article's framing of the issue.

3. the tweet is structured as a critical commentary on another tweet or article, using sarcasm to highlight a perceived flaw in the original message's logic or perspective.

that time when ward was mad because skye hide a secret from him #irony #skyeward #AgentsofSHIELD http://t.co/znfxzbUYVu,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""that time when ward was mad"" indicates a negative emotion (anger). there are no overtly positive or negative keywords beyond this.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be referencing a moment from the tv show ""agents of s.h.i.e.l.d."" with a touch of irony. the hashtag ""#irony"" is explicitly used, suggesting the author is pointing out something ironic about the situation. the irony likely stems from ward being angry about skye hiding a secret, when ward himself is known for keeping secrets in the show.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is somewhat negative (ward being mad), the true intention is to highlight the irony of the situation. the use of the #irony hashtag is a clear indicator that the tweet is meant to be taken as sarcastic or ironic commentary on the characters' actions.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the context of the tv show reference strongly support this classification.",1
"While we applauded ourselves on getting to the Moon, Carl Sagan spoke a truth we all denied.|#irony http://t.co/AY20dRme0L",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with words like ""applauded"" and the achievement of getting to the moon. there's a sense of pride and accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
however, the mention of carl sagan speaking ""a truth we all denied"" suggests a deeper, more critical message. the use of ""#irony"" at the end clearly indicates that the author is pointing out a contradiction or criticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positivity of celebrating the moon landing is contrasted with the implication that we were ignoring a more important truth pointed out by carl sagan. the ""#irony"" hashtag confirms that the author is highlighting this contradiction in a sarcastic manner.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to critique our priorities, praising an achievement while simultaneously pointing out that we were ignoring a more significant truth. the explicit use of ""#irony"" further confirms the sarcastic intent.",1

bromanceshmomance: #I just checked and he has zero#ZERO#mentions asking if Louis was there#NONE#NADA#not... http://t.co/b4W8LszSwZ,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems somewhat neutral to negative. the use of capitalized words like ""zero"", ""none"", and ""nada"" adds emphasis, potentially indicating frustration or disappointment. the phrase ""bromanceshmomance"" at the beginning seems dismissive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing frustration or annoyance. the author seems to be countering a claim or expectation about someone (possibly named louis) being mentioned. the emphatic repetition of ""zero"" in various forms (zero, none, nada) suggests the author is trying to strongly make a point about the absence of something expected.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral, the underlying intention shows frustration and a desire to emphatically prove a point. the exaggerated emphasis and the dismissive tone at the beginning (""bromanceshmomance"") suggest that the author is using sarcasm to express their point more forcefully.

### label: sarcastic

the combination of emphatic language, dismissive tone, and the contrast between the surface neutrality and the underlying frustration points towards a sarcastic expression.",1
Being a light sleeper is the best. #not,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""is the best,"" which typically indicates something highly desirable or enjoyable.

step 2: however, the sentence ends with ""#not,"" which is a common social media tag used to indicate that the preceding statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning. being a light sleeper is generally considered undesirable, as it often leads to poor sleep quality and fatigue.

step 3: the contrast between the positive surface sentiment (""is the best"") and the negating ""#not"" tag, combined with the common understanding that being a light sleeper is usually not preferred, clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to express frustration or dissatisfaction with being a light sleeper.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative or disappointed. key phrases indicating this:
- ""unfortunately taken already""
- ""...a year ago.."" (implying it's too late)
the ellipsis at the end also suggests a feeling of resignation or disappointment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the author appears to be genuinely expressing disappointment that their preferred company for their thesis is no longer available. there don't appear to be any obvious rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would suggest a hidden meaning or sarcastic intent.

step 3: comparison and final inference
comparing steps 1 and 2, there isn't a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of disappointment without any sarcastic undertones.

@MyzzCryz not worried about it. Whenevs 😉,0,"not sarcastic

the response ""@myzzcryz not worried about it. whenevs 😉"" appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic statement. the content and tone suggest a casual, friendly interaction without any apparent sarcasm. the winking emoji (😉) at the end typically indicates friendliness or a light-hearted tone rather than sarcasm in this context. the informal language (""whenevs"" for ""whenever"") also supports a relaxed, sincere communication style.",0
@lr3031 @mjgranger1 #not enough; unfortunately.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the intention isn't immediately clear to me:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or disappointed due to the phrase ""not enough"" and the word ""unfortunately."" there are no positive keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and structure of the tweet make it difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or rhetorical device at play. the hashtag ""#not"" could potentially be used sarcastically, but it's part of a longer phrase ""not enough"" which seems to be used straightforwardly here. the ""unfortunately"" adds a genuine tone of disappointment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be a mismatch or irony present. the tweet seems to be expressing a straightforward sentiment of disappointment or dissatisfaction. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, unexpected positivity, or obvious irony.

### label: not sarcastic

while brief tweets can sometimes be tricky to classify, the straightforward negative sentiment without any clear markers of sarcasm leads me to conclude that this tweet is likely not sarcastic.",0
@IAOLLC . #please email me captainpc@me.com or contact through DM myself or @Bennolikes . #I #have #DM #Address #details #but #not#had#reply,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward request for communication, without any indicators of sarcasm. the user is trying to establish contact through multiple channels (email, dm) and seems genuinely interested in getting a response. the use of hashtags and the mention of not having received a reply suggest urgency and frustration, but not sarcasm. the language is direct and purpose-driven, lacking any ironic or sarcastic overtones.",0
@NPCole23 hahaha yeah I think so too cause you know how she loves her with all her heart 😂😂😂.... #NOT 🔫.,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""hahaha yeah i think so too""
- ""loves her with all her heart""
- laughing emojis 😂😂😂

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
- the excessive use of ""hahaha"" and multiple laughing emojis can indicate mockery
- the phrase ""you know how she loves her with all her heart"" seems exaggerated
- most importantly, the use of ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the previous statement
- the gun emoji 🔫 further emphasizes negative feelings

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention, especially with the explicit ""#not"", is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. the author is using exaggerated positive language to express the opposite sentiment, which is the essence of sarcastic speech.

therefore, i can confidently classify this text as sarcastic.",1
"It's really #NOT #GOOD, too have the #REPUTATION for STEALING FROM GIRLS. @HAUSOFSE7EN & Mr. MASON,..expect a call,..(;",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of ""#not #good"" in all caps
- mentioning ""stealing from girls"" as a negative reputation
- the threatening tone of ""expect a call""
- use of all caps for emphasis on negative words

step 2: true intention
looking deeper:
- the excessive use of hashtags and capitalization seems exaggerated
- the winking emoticon ""(;"" at the end contradicts the serious tone of the threat
- the overall dramatic style suggests the writer may not be entirely serious

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is clearly negative, the exaggerated style and contradictory winking emoticon suggest that the writer is not being entirely sincere. the dramatic presentation of a serious accusation followed by a wink implies that the writer is likely making a joke or being playful rather than genuinely upset.

given this analysis, i believe the text is intended to be sarcastic, using an exaggerated negative tone for humorous effect.

"we need to stop using the words ""racist"" & ""racism"" @nicky0472 @StevenWayneOwen @TheLexZane @nobamamustgo @Anan_VII @TheOldBreed1775",0,"not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this tweet appears to be a straightforward statement expressing the author's opinion that certain terms should not be used. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the message seems to be conveyed in a direct manner without any apparent attempt at humor or mockery.

the use of ""@"" symbols suggests this is part of a twitter conversation, and the author is likely responding seriously to an ongoing discussion about language use. the tone appears earnest rather than sarcastic.

given these factors, i classify this statement as ""not sarcastic.""",0

this tweet appears to be a genuine positive review of a book. the language used is straightforward and enthusiastic, without any obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony. the phrases ""probably my favourite book,"" ""couldn't put it down,"" and ""5stars!"" are all consistent with a sincere recommendation. there's no apparent contradiction or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm, so i'm confident in classifying this as not sarcastic.",0
From what I can tell...most strippers belong right where they are #nocollegeneeded #adamsmith #specialization #strippers,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or judgmental towards strippers. the hashtags ""#nocollegeneeded"" and ""#specialization"" could be interpreted as dismissive of strippers' skills or education. the phrase ""belong right where they are"" might seem to reinforce this sentiment.

step 2: true intention
however, examining the language more closely reveals likely sarcasm:
- the use of hashtags like ""#adamsmith"" (referring to the economist who wrote about specialization of labor) and ""#specialization"" suggest a more sophisticated commentary.
- the exaggerated certainty of ""from what i can tell...most strippers belong right where they are"" hints at mockery of such a simplistic view.
- combining ""#nocollegeneeded"" with ""#adamsmith"" creates an incongruous pairing that signals irony.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface-level negative judgment contrasts sharply with the more nuanced economic references. this disparity, combined with the exaggerated certainty and incongruous hashtag use, strongly suggests that the true intention is to satirize simplistic or judgmental views about strippers and their profession.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

"@Salon dualistic, as in good and evil? Right, because that doesn't apply to the real world.... #sarcasm #OrcsLive",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be disagreement or skepticism. the phrase ""right, because that doesn't apply to the real world...."" suggests a dismissive tone towards the idea of dualism (good and evil) applying to reality.

step 2: the true intention is indeed sarcastic. the author is mocking the notion that a simple good vs. evil dichotomy applies to the real world. the use of ellipsis (....) emphasizes the sarcastic tone. additionally, the hashtags #sarcasm and #orcslive further confirm the sarcastic intent. the reference to orcs (fictional evil creatures) humorously underscores the author's point about oversimplification of good and evil in reality.

step 3: the surface sentiment and true intention align in this case, both pointing towards sarcasm. the explicit use of #sarcasm removes any doubt.

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic"".",1
"#Consensus of Absolute Hilarious #Irony ?#MichaelMann to lecture on #Professional #Ethics for #Climate #Scientists? http://t.co/pD0TEMq1Z0""",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral, with words like ""consensus"" and ""hilarious"" suggesting agreement and amusement. the use of hashtags like ""#professional"" and ""#ethics"" implies seriousness and credibility.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues suggest the true intention is actually mocking or criticizing:
1. the use of ""absolute hilarious"" with ""#irony"" implies the opposite - that it's not actually hilarious, but ironically absurd.
2. the question mark after ""irony"" suggests skepticism or disbelief.
3. putting ""michael mann"" and ""lecture on professional ethics"" together implies the author finds this incongruous or inappropriate.
4. the overall tone seems to be one of incredulity that michael mann would be speaking on this topic.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface sentiment of positivity or neutrality contrasts sharply with the underlying tone of mockery and criticism. the use of apparently positive words to convey a negative sentiment is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. the author is using irony to express disapproval or ridicule of michael mann lecturing on professional ethics for climate scientists.

this tweet appears to be sarcastic. the phrase ""because we're cool as fuck"" is using mock enthusiasm to make fun of people who overuse acronyms to seem cool or trendy. the ""judge me"" at the end reinforces this sarcastic tone, essentially daring people to criticize this behavior while actually criticizing it themselves. the overall message is mocking the idea that using acronyms makes someone cool, rather than genuinely praising it.",1
Only a true nightshift person would understand this #nightshift #hardcore #teamwork #not #always... http://t.co/MpsXN3DJqU,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. keywords like ""true nightshift person,"" ""understand,"" ""teamwork,"" and ""hardcore"" suggest a sense of camaraderie and shared experience. the hashtags also reinforce this sentiment.

step 2: true intention
however, there are some elements that suggest potential sarcasm:
1. the use of ""#not"" contradicts the other positive hashtags.
2. the ellipsis (...) at the end can indicate a pause for effect, often used in sarcastic statements.
3. the phrase ""only a true nightshift person would understand"" could be interpreted as an exaggerated or mocking statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears positive, the contradictory ""#not"" and the potential for exaggeration suggest that the true intention may be sarcastic. the speaker seems to be poking fun at the idea of nightshift work being particularly special or hardcore.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of contradictory elements and the potential for mocking exaggeration leads me to conclude that this statement is likely sarcastic.",1

Sunday is such a fun day to study #not #ew #saywhat,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""such a fun day"" and ""to study,"" which normally indicate enjoyment and productivity. 

step 2: true intention
however, the hashtags at the end completely reverse this sentiment:
- ""#not"" directly negates the previous statement
- ""#ew"" expresses disgust
- ""#saywhat"" indicates disbelief or disagreement

these hashtags strongly suggest that the true intention is to express that studying on sunday is actually not fun at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive statement and the negating hashtags is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is using verbal irony to say one thing but mean the opposite.

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic, using a positive statement followed by contradictory hashtags to express that studying on sunday is actually unpleasant.",1
Reunited with my pump this morning. #yay #not 😣,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the word ""reunited"" which often has a positive connotation
- the hashtag ""#yay"" which expresses excitement or joy
- the use of ""this morning"" suggesting a fresh start to the day

step 2: however, the true intention seems negative:
- the hashtag ""#not"" contradicts the positive ""#yay""
- the use of the sad/frustrated emoji 😣 at the end conveys negative emotions
- ""pump"" likely refers to an insulin pump or similar medical device, which isn't typically something one is excited to be reunited with

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see a clear contradiction between the surface-level positive sentiment and the actual negative sentiment. the author is using positive language sarcastically to express their frustration or disappointment about having to use their pump again.

"My dad's still gonna get me santa's gifts since it's my last year before 18, but I really don't know what to ask for... #irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems somewhat positive or neutral. the person mentions their father still getting them gifts for christmas, which is generally seen as a nice gesture. however, there's a hint of uncertainty or confusion with ""i really don't know what to ask for...""

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be conveying irony or sarcasm. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the speaker is not being entirely straightforward. the mention of it being the ""last year before 18"" suggests a transition to adulthood, which contrasts with still receiving gifts from ""santa,"" typically associated with childhood beliefs.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is fairly neutral or slightly positive, the addition of ""#irony"" and the juxtaposition of approaching adulthood with childlike elements (santa's gifts) strongly suggests sarcasm. the speaker is likely commenting on the awkwardness or absurdity of still receiving ""santa's gifts"" at their age.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" and the contextual clues strongly indicate that this statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.",1
Remember that one time I worked both jobs while sick and it didnt suck at all... #sarcasm #notworthit,1,"sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses clear sarcasm by saying ""it didnt suck at all"" when describing a clearly unpleasant experience of working two jobs while sick. the use of ""...#sarcasm"" as a hashtag at the end explicitly confirms the sarcastic intent. the additional hashtag ""#notworthit"" further reinforces that the experience was actually negative, contrary to the surface-level positive statement.",1

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of genuine excitement about an upcoming semester. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory context. the phrase ""really excited"" is a common and sincere way to express positive anticipation. without any additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement can be taken at face value as a non-sarcastic expression of enthusiasm.",0
"@MericaMcFreedom @Heritage Actually, even delivery won't save some. O voted to let born alive die. Also, look up ""4th trimester abortions"".",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the content requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears serious and critical. there are no overtly positive or sarcastic keywords or phrases. the tone seems to be discussing serious topics like abortion and voting records.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to criticize and express disagreement with certain political positions, particularly around abortion. the mention of ""4th trimester abortions"" is noteworthy, as this is not a real medical term. it could be used to exaggerate or make a point about late-term abortions.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the overall tone is serious, the use of ""4th trimester abortions"" suggests a potentially sarcastic or hyperbolic element. however, this alone doesn't make the entire statement sarcastic. the rest of the content appears to be a sincere expression of political disagreement.

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a hint of hyperbole with the ""4th trimester"" comment, the overall intent and tone of the message appear to be sincere criticism rather than sarcasm. the statement is primarily conveying disagreement with certain political positions using mostly straightforward language.",0
good luck finding someone to take the other side of that bet LOL @orion99da,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive with phrases like ""good luck"" and the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud). however, the phrase ""finding someone to take the other side of that bet"" suggests a challenge or difficulty.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing doubt or skepticism about the likelihood of finding someone to take the opposite position in a bet. the ""lol"" at the end reinforces this skepticism by implying that the idea is laughable or absurd. the phrase ""good luck"" is likely used ironically here, not sincerely wishing luck but rather suggesting that success is highly unlikely.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment includes positive elements (""good luck"", ""lol""), the true intention is to express doubt and skepticism. the use of ""good luck"" in this context is clearly ironic, as the speaker doesn't actually believe the person will succeed in finding someone to take the opposite bet. the ""lol"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone by laughing at the improbability of the situation.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses irony and a mocking tone to convey a message opposite to its literal meaning, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1
It is good that very few businesses/govts in EM economies have borrowed much via dollar-denominated loans from international banks. #Sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""it is good that"" suggests a positive outlook on the situation described.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed by the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end of the tweet. this explicitly indicates that the author means the opposite of what they're saying.

step 3: the contrast between the seemingly positive statement and the sarcasm hashtag confirms that this is indeed a sarcastic tweet. the author is actually implying that it's bad or concerning that businesses and governments in emerging market economies have borrowed heavily in dollar-denominated loans, which could lead to financial instability.

the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag makes this classification straightforward, hence my high confidence in labeling it as ""sarcastic.""",1
@LoseThosePoundz: 🙌🙌 http://t.co/ptl2nSnFFO #fitfam #fitness #health,0,"not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this tweet appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic promotion of fitness and health content. the use of positive emojis (🙌🙌), along with popular fitness-related hashtags (#fitfam #fitness #health), indicates enthusiasm for the topic. the account name ""@losethosepoundz"" also suggests a focus on weight loss and fitness. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/ptl2nsnffo) is likely directing followers to fitness-related content or resources.

there are no indicators of irony, contradiction, or unexpected twists that would typically signal sarcasm. the message is straightforward and aligns with common social media practices for sharing health and fitness content. therefore, this tweet can be confidently classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0

What a great way to start the day!! #Not 😠,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""what a great way to start the day!!"" - this phrase typically expresses enthusiasm and positivity.
- the use of double exclamation marks (!!) reinforces the apparent excitement.

however, there are conflicting elements:
- ""#not"" suggests a negation of the previous statement.
- the angry face emoji (😠) indicates frustration or anger.

step 2: true intention
analyzing the rhetorical devices and language style:
- the enthusiastic phrase followed immediately by ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm.
- the angry emoji further confirms that the writer's true feelings are negative, not positive.
- this combination of an exaggeratedly positive statement followed by explicit negation and a negative emoji is a common sarcastic structure.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface sentiment (positive) is deliberately contradicted by the ""#not"" tag and the angry emoji. this stark contrast between the initial positive statement and the subsequent negation and negative emotion is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to express frustration or disappointment about how the day is starting, disguising it initially as a positive statement before revealing the true negative sentiment.",1
@tombitt I wonder what % of that 43% agree on what a private cloud is,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly curious. the phrase ""i wonder"" indicates a questioning attitude, and there are no overtly positive or negative words. the tone seems inquisitive rather than emotional.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing skepticism or doubt about the validity of a statistic. by questioning what percentage of the 43% agree on the definition of a private cloud, the author is implying that the statistic might be meaningless or unreliable if there's no consensus on what's being measured.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is neutral and inquiring, the underlying intention is to cast doubt on the statistic. this subtle mismatch between the seemingly innocent question and the implication of the statistic's unreliability suggests a sarcastic tone. the author is using a rhetorical question to make a point about the potential meaninglessness of the statistic.

### label: sarcastic

the subtle way of questioning the validity of the statistic through an apparently innocent wondering is a classic sarcastic technique, using understatement to make a critical point.",1
If i were to ask. I want to stay here for as long as possible..|#thinking,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or neutral. the phrase ""i want to stay here for as long as possible"" suggests a desire to remain in a particular place, which is typically associated with positive feelings. the ""#thinking"" hashtag at the end indicates contemplation or reflection.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is less clear. the phrase ""if i were to ask"" introduces a hypothetical scenario, which could suggest some hesitation or uncertainty. the use of ellipsis (..) before the hashtag might indicate a trailing off of thought or imply something left unsaid. the ""#thinking"" hashtag reinforces the idea that the speaker is considering or questioning their statement.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment seems positive, the structure of the sentence and the additional elements (hypothetical intro, ellipsis, hashtag) introduce ambiguity. there's no clear contradiction between the surface sentiment and the true intention, nor is there any obvious exaggeration or irony that would typically indicate sarcasm.

given these considerations, there isn't strong evidence to suggest this statement is sarcastic. the ambiguity and contemplative nature of the statement seem more indicative of genuine reflection rather than sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic",0
@Atlantasportguy @darrenrovell @DJFJennings Just wait till Cleveland comes again! #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification because:

1. the tweet uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly, which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be understood as sarcastic.

2. the phrase ""just wait till cleveland comes again!"" appears to be expressing excitement or anticipation on the surface, but given the sarcasm hashtag, it's likely meant to convey the opposite sentiment.

3. the context suggests that the author is probably mocking or making light of cleveland's performance or chances in some sporting context.

the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag removes any ambiguity, making this a straightforward classification.",1
"'Liberated' Iraq -- 2014 One of Bloodiest Years with More than 36,000 Victims: http://t.co/GCW05uriIT Thank you, Western liberators #sarcasm",1,"label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears positive due to words like ""liberated"" and ""thank you, western liberators"". these phrases typically connote gratitude and positive outcomes.

step 2 (true intention):
however, the true intention is clearly negative and critical. the tweet mentions ""one of bloodiest years"" and ""36,000 victims"", which are extremely negative outcomes. the use of quotation marks around ""liberated"" suggests skepticism about this claim. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the tweet is meant sarcastically.

step 3 (analysis and conclusion):
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive language (""liberated"", ""thank you"") and the horrific reality described (bloodshed and victims) is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is using this sarcasm to criticize the idea that iraq was truly ""liberated"" by western intervention, pointing out the devastating consequences instead. the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" removes any doubt about the author's intention.

therefore, this tweet is definitely sarcastic.",1
@KirstieMAllsopp one hope this gets a RT! #recycling #roses #holly #wreath #MerryChristmas http://t.co/ZNNZtQCvCt,0,"for this input, i'll analyze it step-by-step as the sarcasm classification is not immediately obvious.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic. keywords and phrases like ""hope"", ""rt!"" (retweet), ""merrychristmas"", and the use of multiple hashtags (#recycling, #roses, #holly, #wreath) suggest a cheerful, festive mood. the exclamation marks add to the enthusiastic tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. this appears to be a genuine tweet aimed at getting attention for a christmas-related post, likely an image of a wreath made from recycled materials. the user is tagging kirstie allsopp (a british tv presenter known for home and lifestyle shows) in hopes of getting a retweet to increase visibility.

step 3: comparison and analysis
after comparing the surface sentiment and the likely true intention, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy or hidden meaning. the tweet seems straightforward in its attempt to share content and gain attention through a celebrity retweet. there are no obvious rhetorical devices or language styles that would indicate sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""so bad"" and ""i'm sorry to say"" indicate a critical or apologetic tone about someone's performance.

step 2: true intention
however, looking closer at the context:
- this is a tweet from @sundaychants, likely a sports-related account.
- they're asking followers to tag teammates who are ""so bad, he runs the line every week.""
- running the line is typically a punishment or extra training in sports.
- the attached image (though we can't see it) likely adds humor to the situation.
- tagging a specific person (@sam__clough) in this context suggests playful teasing rather than genuine criticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention appears to be playful banter or teasing among teammates or sports fans. the exaggerated language (""so bad"") and the public nature of tagging someone in this context suggests it's not meant to be taken seriously.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to playfully tease a teammate or fellow fan, rather than genuinely criticizing their performance.",1

step 2: the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the author is expressing genuine disappointment about their team's performance. they're pointing out that despite having an ""easiest cl group"" with ""two rubbish teams,"" their team still performed poorly, winning only one game, and that too with a ""lucky last minute pen[alty].""

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be any mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the author is straightforwardly expressing their disappointment without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the hashtags ""#not good enough"" and ""#gutted"" further reinforce the genuine nature of the sentiment.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see a clear mismatch. the speaker is using positive language (""okay cool"") to express a negative sentiment (likely frustration or disappointment that no one is up). the ""#not"" confirms this mismatch and sarcastic intent.

step 2: the true intention seems to be criticizing those who claim to cover wvhs basketball but apparently don't. the author is using sarcasm to point out this discrepancy by juxtaposing the criticism with actual news about a game-winning shot.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that the initial negative sentiment and the use of ""#not"" are indeed sarcastic. the author is using this sarcasm to highlight the contrast between the lack of coverage and the exciting game result they're sharing.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""here we go again"" followed by ""#not"" strongly indicates sarcasm, even though it's mixed with factual information about the game. the author is sarcastically thanking those who claim to cover the team but don't, while simultaneously providing the coverage themselves.",1
Long day and its not going to be possible without my good friend #coffee,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of reliance on coffee to get through a long day. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the sentiment is genuine appreciation for coffee as a helpful ""friend"" during a challenging day. the use of the hashtag #coffee reinforces the sincere sentiment rather than undermining it. therefore, this statement can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0
Just loveeee driving upstate in the snow #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- use of ""loveeee"" (exaggerated spelling of ""love"")
- describing an activity that some people might enjoy (driving upstate in the snow)

step 2: true intention
however, there are clear indicators that the true intention is negative:
- the exaggerated spelling of ""loveeee"" can be read as overly dramatic or insincere
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the preceding statement

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the negating hashtag ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is using verbal irony to express that they actually dislike or find it unpleasant to drive upstate in the snow.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""#not"" leaves no doubt about the sarcastic intent, making this classification highly confident.",1
"If you know people who could talk power-dressing and social media marketing, please let me know. Thanks",0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward request for professional contacts. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the text. the person is genuinely seeking individuals who are knowledgeable about power-dressing and social media marketing, which are legitimate business-related topics. the polite ""please"" and ""thanks"" further reinforce the sincerity of the request. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as not sarcastic.",0
I love getting up at 4 30 so I can wait on other ppl! #sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

1. the surface sentiment appears positive with ""i love getting up at 4:30,"" which normally would indicate enjoyment.

2. however, the true intention is clearly negative. getting up very early (4:30) to wait on others is generally not enjoyable. the exclamation mark adds emphasis to the sarcastic tone.

3. the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end confirms the sarcastic nature of the statement.

the contrast between the positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true meaning, along with the explicit sarcasm tag, makes this a clear case of sarcasm.",1
"Faux Leather Size Zipper Sleeveless Scoop Back Midi Dress|Size:s, m, l|Price:$39.99|Leave email for... http://t.co/vTQxkHv6YK",0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward product description or advertisement for a dress, including details about its material, size options, price, and a truncated url. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in this message. it's a neutral, informational text typical of product listings or social media marketing posts.",0
and as much as I want to connect .. I like only the people who dont want to .. #Irony #Why oh why?,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive and introspective. the author expresses a desire to connect with people, which is generally seen as a positive social trait. the use of ""i like"" also suggests a positive feeling. however, the hashtags #irony and #why oh why? introduce a note of complexity or contradiction.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or self-deprecating humor about a paradoxical situation. the author is pointing out that they only seem to like people who don't want to connect with them, which is the opposite of their stated desire to connect. this creates a contradictory and likely frustrating situation for the author.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of wanting to connect is contradicted by the stated preference for people who don't want to connect. this contradiction, combined with the use of #irony hashtag, strongly suggests that the author is being sarcastic about their own social preferences or experiences. the #why oh why? further emphasizes the author's exasperation with this situation, adding to the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this text as:

### label: sarcastic

the use of irony to highlight a contradictory personal trait or situation is a classic form of sarcasm, and this text fits that pattern well.",1
@oneplanetmikey I saw a leaf blowing in the breeze. You could yell at that if you wanted to?,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. there's no obviously negative language or strong emotions expressed. the sentence describes a calm, mundane observation (seeing a leaf blowing) and offers a seemingly innocuous suggestion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or belittling the person being addressed (@oneplanetmikey). the suggestion to ""yell at a leaf"" implies that the addressee might be looking for trivial things to get angry about or overreact to. this subtle mockery indicates a sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying intention is to make fun of or criticize the addressee's behavior. the contrast between the calm observation and the absurd suggestion of yelling at a leaf creates a sarcastic effect. the speaker is not sincerely suggesting yelling at a leaf but using this exaggeration to point out the perceived ridiculousness of the addressee's actions or attitudes.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
@ozchrisrock hold on a minute. Are you saying All blonde white women look the same?? #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be one of shock or indignation at the idea that someone might think all blonde white women look the same. the use of ""hold on a minute"" and double question marks suggests surprise or disagreement.

step 2: the true intention is actually to mock the idea that someone would make such a broad generalization. the author is using rhetorical questions and exaggeration to highlight the absurdity of such a statement. the inclusion of the #sarcasm hashtag explicitly signals that the tweet is meant sarcastically.

step 3: the surface sentiment (apparent shock) contrasts with the true intention (mockery of a stereotypical view). this discrepancy, combined with the explicit #sarcasm tag, clearly indicates that the tweet is sarcastic.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
@ChristianCaple Gotta love those racially based awards! #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""gotta love,"" which typically expresses enthusiasm or appreciation.

step 2: however, several clues indicate this is actually sarcastic:
1. the topic of ""racially based awards"" is controversial and typically viewed negatively.
2. the use of the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly negating the preceding statement.
3. the exclamation mark adds emphasis that feels exaggerated in this context.

step 3: the surface positive sentiment (""gotta love"") sharply contrasts with the true negative sentiment about racial bias in awards. the ""#not"" hashtag confirms this contrast is intentional sarcasm.

therefore, this tweet is clearly sarcastic, criticizing the concept of racially based awards through irony.",1
"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul, and makes us reach for more...💖",0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine, heartfelt expression about love without any sarcastic undertones. the language is sincere and positive, using words like ""best,"" ""awakens the soul,"" and ""reach for more,"" which are typically associated with earnest romantic sentiments. the heart emoji (💖) at the end further reinforces the sincere and affectionate nature of the statement. there are no contradictory elements or ironic twists that would suggest sarcasm. this seems to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic expression of an idealistic view of love.",0
clashupdate #not http://t.co/1bFOsIwnI5,1,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward update or notification about a clash, likely referring to a game or event. the ""#not"" tag is likely used to indicate that this is not an actual update, perhaps to avoid confusion. there's no apparent sarcasm or irony in the message. it's a simple, direct communication, possibly correcting or clarifying something. the included link (http://t.co/1bfosiwni5) would presumably lead to more information about what is actually happening instead of a clash update.",0
@allkpop: Super Junior's Henry asks sasaeng fans to let him sleep|http://t.co/BhrEKEtMka http://t.co/mvzxJL04PL||Aw Henry oppa >^<,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet consists of two parts: a news headline about super junior's henry asking sasaeng fans (overly obsessive fans) to let him sleep, and a fan's reaction to this news.

the fan's reaction ""aw henry oppa >^<"" appears to be genuine sympathy and affection. the ""aw"" expresses concern, ""henry oppa"" is a respectful and endearing way fans address male k-pop idols, and "">^<"" is a cute emoticon often used to express affection or sympathy.

there are no indicators of sarcasm here. the fan seems to be sincerely reacting to henry's plea for privacy with sympathy and support. the tone is consistent with how k-pop fans often express concern for their favorite idols' well-being.

therefore, i classify this as not sarcastic. the fan's response appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of sympathy for henry's situation.",0
I have officially surrounded myself with the most amazing people 😊,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of gratitude and happiness. the use of the word ""amazing"" to describe the people around the speaker and the inclusion of a smiling emoji (😊) both indicate a positive sentiment that aligns with the literal meaning of the sentence. there are no obvious clues or contradictions that would suggest sarcasm is being employed here. the speaker seems to be sincerely expressing appreciation for their social circle.",0
@jthurgood1 @Cameron_Gray republicans suck more at identifying #irony than alanis morissette.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative towards republicans, with phrases like ""republicans suck"" and comparing them unfavorably to alanis morissette in identifying irony. the overall tone seems critical and mocking.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. the tweet is criticizing republicans' ability to recognize irony or sarcasm. the reference to alanis morissette adds an extra layer of mockery, as her song ""ironic"" is famously criticized for not actually containing many examples of irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
in this case, the surface sentiment and true intention align. the tweet is using a direct, mocking tone to criticize republicans. while the statement is humorous and exaggerated, it doesn't appear to be saying the opposite of what it means. the comparison to alanis morissette is clever wordplay but not sarcastic in itself.

### label: not sarcastic

while the tweet is mocking and uses humor, it doesn't employ sarcasm in the strict sense of saying the opposite of what is meant. the criticism is straightforward, even if exaggerated for effect.",0
That's always the solution..... #not. Doesn't fix anything!,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive at first, with the phrase ""that's always the solution."" this seems to suggest agreement or approval.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed through several elements:
- the ellipsis (""....."") suggests a pause or hesitation, hinting at doubt.
- ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly negating the previous statement.
- ""doesn't fix anything!"" directly contradicts the initial positive statement.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (positive agreement) with the true intention (disagreement and frustration), it's clear that this statement is sarcastic. the author is using a positive statement followed by explicit contradiction to emphasize their actual negative opinion.

the use of ""#not"" is a particularly strong indicator of sarcasm in modern language, making this a clear case of sarcastic speech.",1
Name an #excuse that people use #NOT to #workout ... http://t.co/tE75PwPGbm,0,"sarcastic

i believe this tweet is sarcastic, and i'm fairly confident in this assessment. here's my reasoning:

the tweet is phrased as a prompt or challenge to name an excuse people use not to workout. the use of capitalized ""not"" and the hashtag format suggests this is meant to be a humorous or pointed comment about people's tendency to make excuses to avoid exercise.

the sarcasm comes from the implication that there are countless excuses people use, and by asking others to name them, the tweet is highlighting how common and perhaps ridiculous these excuses are. it's a playful way of calling out procrastination or avoidance of exercise.

the included link (though we can't see the content) likely leads to an image or article that further emphasizes this point, possibly in a humorous way.

given these elements, the tweet appears to be using sarcasm to comment on human behavior regarding exercise avoidance, rather than genuinely seeking excuses. therefore, i confidently classify this as ""sarcastic.""",1
"@SteveMcKrosky @imbalaska @DaveMyFace @Clover_Joy_ @den2114 @MeyrickHarris ""left regressives"" is that not a label #irony",1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly questioning. the phrase ""is that not a label"" suggests a questioning tone. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end could be interpreted as a surface indication of irony or sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out a contradiction or hypocrisy. the user is highlighting that the term ""left regressives"" is itself a label, while seemingly questioning the use of labels. the hashtag ""#irony"" reinforces this intention, suggesting that the author finds it ironic that someone might use a label while potentially criticizing the use of labels.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface question ""is that not a label"" combined with the ""#irony"" hashtag strongly suggests that the author is not genuinely asking a question, but rather making a point about the irony of using labels. the sarcastic tone comes from presenting this observation as a question rather than a direct statement, and explicitly tagging it as irony.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses a rhetorical question and explicit irony tagging to sarcastically point out the contradiction in using a label while potentially criticizing labels.",1
@Brice_Jones but you can't expect us to hire one in only 3 weeks. Who moves that quickly on a coaching search? #sarcasm,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment because:

1. the tweet includes the explicit hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end, which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

2. the content of the tweet uses rhetorical exaggeration. the phrase ""you can't expect us to hire one in only 3 weeks"" and ""who moves that quickly on a coaching search?"" are meant to be understood as the opposite of their literal meaning. in reality, three weeks is generally considered a reasonable timeframe for a coaching search.

3. the tone of the message implies criticism of an unrealistic expectation, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.

given these clear indicators, particularly the explicit sarcasm hashtag, i'm very confident in classifying this as sarcastic.",1
A #celebrity is a person who is known for his well-knownness. #fact #TeamFollowBack #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or slightly positive. the tweet defines a celebrity in a matter-of-fact way, using hashtags like #fact and #teamfollowback, which seem to present it as straightforward information.

step 2: true intention
however, there are several clues that suggest this isn't meant to be taken at face value:
1. the definition itself is circular and somewhat nonsensical (""known for his well-knownness"").
2. the use of ""#irony"" at the end explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken literally.
3. the juxtaposition of #fact with #irony creates a contradiction that hints at sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears neutral or informative, the true intention seems to be making a satirical comment on the nature of celebrity. the circular definition mocks the idea that some celebrities are famous simply for being famous, rather than for any particular talent or achievement. the use of popular hashtags like #teamfollowback alongside #irony further emphasizes this critique of shallow fame.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to make a sarcastic comment about the nature of celebrity in modern culture.",1
Is there a basketball game on today? I'm not really sure. #ESPN seems to not be promoting anything about it. #sarcasm,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be uncertainty and genuine questioning. the speaker claims they're ""not really sure"" if there's a basketball game today and mentions that espn doesn't seem to be promoting anything.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the hashtag #sarcasm at the end. this explicitly signals that the previous statements are meant sarcastically. in reality, the speaker is implying that espn is likely promoting basketball games extensively, contrary to what they've stated.

step 3: analysis and final label
the contrast between the feigned uncertainty in the text and the reality (that espn probably promotes basketball games heavily) creates the sarcastic tone. the use of ""#sarcasm"" removes any doubt about the speaker's intention.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"". the text is a clear example of sarcasm used to humorously comment on espn's typically extensive promotion of basketball games.",1
@Ed_Miliband @edballsmp @andyburnhammp We Agree #NHSENGLAND needs to #Publish #AandE figures over #HolidayPeriod #Sarcasm from #JeremyHunt,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet uses hashtags like #nhsengland, #publish, #aande, #holidayperiod, which appear to be calling for transparency in publishing a&e figures. the phrase ""we agree"" suggests a positive sentiment towards this idea. however, the presence of #sarcasm and the mention of #jeremyhunt (who was the health secretary at the time) complicates the surface reading.

step 2: true intention
the inclusion of #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the tweet is not meant to be taken at face value. the author is likely criticizing jeremy hunt and suggesting that the nhs england would not actually publish a&e figures over the holiday period, despite claims or expectations that they should.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text appears to support publishing a&e figures, the #sarcasm hashtag directly contradicts this. the tweet is using irony to criticize the lack of transparency or expected lack of action from nhs england and jeremy hunt. the true intention is to express skepticism or criticism about the likelihood of a&e figures being published.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the explicit use of #sarcasm, combined with the context and implied criticism, clearly indicates that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
"If you've got the world on a string, you should give me some of that string, think of all the cool applications. #whatamidoing",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is subtle here:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment seems positive and whimsical. the phrase ""got the world on a string"" is typically a positive idiom meaning to be in control or have everything going well. the speaker is asking for some of that ""string,"" which on the surface seems like a friendly, playful request.

step 2: true intention:
the true intention appears to be self-deprecating humor or a commentary on the absurdity of the idiom when taken literally. the hashtag ""#whatamidoing"" at the end is a clear indication that the speaker is aware they're saying something nonsensical or silly.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
while the surface sentiment is positive and playful, the true intention is to point out the absurdity of taking the idiom literally and to make a joke at their own expense. the contrast between the seemingly earnest request in the first part and the self-aware hashtag at the end creates a sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses the literal interpretation of a common idiom to create humor, coupled with a self-aware hashtag that acknowledges the silliness of the statement. this combination of elements makes it a sarcastic comment.",1
Christmas this Christmas that FOH its just a day people !! get a grip and sit down nd chow some Mopani worms,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and dismissive towards christmas. key phrases like ""foh"" (which typically means ""f*** outta here""), ""its just a day"", and ""get a grip"" indicate frustration or annoyance with the emphasis on christmas. the exclamation marks also suggest strong emotion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the author appears genuinely irritated by the focus on christmas and is telling people to calm down about it. the suggestion to ""sit down nd chow some mopani worms"" (a food item not typically associated with christmas in many cultures) further emphasizes the author's desire to treat the day as ordinary.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. there's no apparent contradiction or irony that would suggest sarcasm. the language is direct and seems to express genuine frustration with christmas hype.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward expression of annoyance towards christmas celebrations, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.",0
#Warn them that your degree of #sarcasm depends on them in this #funny tank top! Order now at http://t.co/UYSi2qgA4S! http://t.co/yjQh8wj3ni,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment based on the following analysis:

the tweet is promoting a tank top with a sarcastic message. the key indicators are:

1. the explicit mention of ""#sarcasm"" in the tweet.
2. the phrase ""your degree of #sarcasm depends on them"" implies the shirt is meant to display sarcastic content.
3. the use of ""#funny"" suggests the shirt's message is intended to be humorous, which often aligns with sarcasm.
4. the overall context of advertising a product (tank top) that warns about the wearer's sarcasm level clearly indicates that sarcasm is the main selling point and theme.

given these clear indicators, especially the direct reference to sarcasm, this tweet can be confidently classified as sarcastic. the tweet itself is not necessarily sarcastic, but it's explicitly about sarcasm and promoting a sarcastic product, which places it firmly in the ""sarcastic"" category for this classification task.",1
The #Gophers aren't nervous. #SammyCommentary #Gophers,0,"to properly classify this tweet, i'll need to think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. the statement ""the #gophers aren't nervous"" suggests a calm, confident attitude. there are no obviously negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
this tweet seems to be a sports commentary, indicated by the hashtags #sammycommentary and #gophers (likely referring to a sports team). the brevity and use of hashtags suggest it's meant to be a quick, possibly tongue-in-cheek observation. the emphasis on the gophers not being nervous could be interpreted as implying the opposite - that they actually are nervous.

step 3: analysis and inference
while the surface sentiment is straightforward, the context of sports commentary and the somewhat emphatic statement about not being nervous could be interpreted as sarcastic. sports commentators and fans often use sarcasm to discuss team performance or pre-game attitudes. however, without more context about the specific game or situation, it's difficult to be certain that this is sarcasm rather than a genuine observation.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic markers, i would lean towards classifying this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i acknowledge that there's room for interpretation, and with more context, this classification could potentially change.",0
Bitches be like ..... #more #appointments #please #not#crazy#enough .... YET @ orthodontist http://t.co/p7PycV1NMU,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""bitches be like"" is often used in a mocking or critical tone
- the hashtags ""#more #appointments #please"" seem positive on the surface
- ""#not#crazy#enough"" could be read as negative or self-deprecating
- ""yet"" in all caps adds emphasis and possibly implies a future change

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""bitches be like"" suggests the author is mocking or criticizing a behavior
- the hashtags about wanting more appointments are likely not sincere, given the mocking tone
- ""#not#crazy#enough .... yet"" implies that wanting more appointments is seen as crazy behavior
- the location tag at an orthodontist adds context that these are likely dental appointments

step 3: analysis and inference
- the surface positivity about wanting more appointments clashes with the mocking tone and implication that this desire is ""crazy""
- the author is likely using sarcasm to criticize people who actually want more orthodontist appointments
- the exaggerated enthusiasm in the hashtags contrasts with the negative implication, a common sarcastic technique

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
I am so glad that I woke up early for this office visit to have to the mother not show up! #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence starts with ""i am so glad,"" which on the surface expresses positive sentiment. it suggests the speaker is happy about waking up early for an office visit.

step 2: true intention
however, the rest of the sentence reveals that the mother didn't show up for the appointment. this contradicts the initial positive sentiment. additionally, the use of the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly stating that the speaker means the opposite of what they said.

step 3: analysis and final label
the contrast between the seemingly positive opening and the frustrating situation described, coupled with the ""#not"" hashtag, clearly indicates that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is actually expressing frustration and annoyance at waking up early for no reason due to the no-show.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1

Sickens me that killing innocent black men & children has become such a lucrative career in America. #MikeBrown #TrayvonMartin #EricGarner,0,"given the sensitive and serious nature of the input text, i'll analyze it carefully step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is extremely negative, indicated by words like ""sickens"" and the mention of ""killing innocent black men & children"". the text expresses disgust and outrage at systemic violence against black americans.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. the author is genuinely expressing anger and dismay at the ongoing incidents of violence against black individuals in america, referencing specific victims (mike brown, trayvon martin, eric garner). the phrase ""lucrative career"" is used bitterly to criticize how some individuals or institutions seem to benefit from these tragedies.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the author is using strong, emotive language to convey sincere outrage. while the phrase ""lucrative career"" could be seen as darkly ironic, it's not being used in a sarcastic manner but rather as a scathing criticism.

### label: not sarcastic

the text expresses genuine anger and criticism without employing sarcasm. it's a straightforward, albeit emotionally charged, statement about a serious societal issue.",0
50km into the #Rapha #festive500 and we stop off for a Coffee#1... Toes are coming back to life @willbmx,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. key phrases like ""stop off for a coffee"" and ""toes are coming back to life"" suggest a pleasant break during a cycling event. the use of hashtags (#rapha #festive500) indicates enthusiasm for the event.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony. the tweet appears to be a genuine update about a cycling journey, mentioning a coffee break and the physical sensation of warmth returning to toes, which is common in cold-weather cycling.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. the tweet reads as a straightforward, positive update about a cycling experience. there are no obvious sarcastic elements or contradictions that would suggest the writer means the opposite of what they're saying.

### label: not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic update about a cycling experience during a festive event.",0
@RailwaySloth u do really need to get a wee bit more lol,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this tweet isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems slightly positive or neutral. the phrase ""need to get a wee bit more lol"" suggests a light-hearted tone. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) typically indicates amusement or friendliness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a gentle teasing or mild criticism. the phrase ""u do really need to"" implies that the speaker thinks the person (@railwaysloth) is lacking in something. the ""wee bit more"" softens this criticism, making it sound playful rather than harsh. the ""lol"" at the end further reinforces the playful tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a slight mismatch between the surface positivity and the underlying criticism, the overall tone doesn't seem to reach the level of sarcasm. the criticism is softened and presented in a friendly manner, which is different from the biting or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is:

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a friendly tease or gentle suggestion rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
"@steveh603 so if they undo the affordable care act, and I should expect my insurance to decline 33%? #Not #Gonna #Happen",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or skeptical. the use of hashtags ""#not #gonna #happen"" suggests disbelief or rejection of the idea presented in the first part of the tweet.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet is to express skepticism about the claim that undoing the affordable care act would lead to a 33% decline in insurance costs. the author is using rhetorical questioning and hashtags to convey their disbelief in this outcome.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention, but the way it's expressed involves sarcasm. the rhetorical question ""so if they undo the affordable care act, and i should expect my insurance to decline 33%?"" is not a genuine inquiry but a way to mock or ridicule the implied claim. the hashtags ""#not #gonna #happen"" reinforce this sarcastic tone by emphatically stating the author's disbelief.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to criticize or mock claims about the effects of undoing the affordable care act.",1
@DaveNavarro @SpikeInkMaster #not sure who will take it home?,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral or slightly curious. the phrase ""not sure who will take it home"" indicates uncertainty or a genuine question. there are no strongly positive or negative keywords, no emojis, and no overtly sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a genuine question or expression of uncertainty. the use of ""@"" mentions suggests this is likely a social media post, possibly twitter, discussing some kind of competition or event. the hashtag #not reinforces the idea of uncertainty. there doesn't appear to be any obvious rhetorical devices or unusual language style that would indicate a hidden meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. both point towards a straightforward expression of uncertainty or curiosity about an outcome. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine question or expression of uncertainty without any sarcastic undertones.",0
"I actually just started crying while brushing my teeth due to lack of sleep, stress and test anxiety. Today's gonna be a good one... #not",1,"label: sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at the end with ""today's gonna be a good one..."" however, this is immediately followed by ""#not"", which is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of the message is to express that the day is actually going to be terrible. the author describes crying while brushing teeth due to lack of sleep, stress, and test anxiety - all negative experiences. 

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly positive statement ""today's gonna be a good one..."" and the preceding negative experiences, along with the ""#not"" hashtag, clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to emphasize how bad they expect the day to be.

therefore, this text is clearly sarcastic, using a common sarcastic structure of stating something positive but meaning the opposite, reinforced by the explicit sarcasm marker ""#not"".",1
Don't you just love those people who won't shut up in class then hold everyone back by asking the teacher to repeat answers? #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification without needing to break it down step-by-step. the reasons for this assessment are:

1. the use of ""don't you just love..."" to introduce a clearly annoying behavior is a common sarcastic phrase.
2. the description of the behavior is negative (people who won't shut up and hold everyone back), which contrasts with the positive sentiment of ""love.""
3. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly labels the statement as sarcastic.

these elements together make it very clear that this is a sarcastic statement, so i can confidently classify it as ""sarcastic"" without further analysis.",1
"@KAFosterSowell Oh, BELIEVE me. I agree totally. My tweet was pure #sarcasm. We need MORE #guns, not less. Santa is bringing me one. #2A",1,"i'm confident in my judgment for this one, so i'll provide the label directly:

### label: sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the author explicitly states ""#sarcasm"" in their message, which is a direct indicator. additionally, the exaggerated tone (""oh, believe me"", ""we need more #guns, not less"", ""santa is bringing me one"") further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the statement. the author is using irony to criticize pro-gun arguments by seemingly endorsing them in an over-the-top manner.",1
The #Congressional #report on #torture #confirms that #AlQaeda was #not #involved in the #attacks of #September 11|http://t.co/GNBabcXR25,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the classification isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet appears to be stating a factual claim about a congressional report on torture. the tone seems neutral, without obvious positive or negative sentiment words. the use of hashtags is informational rather than emotional.

step 2: true intention
the content of the tweet is potentially controversial, claiming that al-qaeda was not involved in the september 11 attacks, which contradicts widely accepted information. this kind of statement could be intended to provoke a reaction or highlight perceived inconsistencies in official narratives.

step 3: analysis and inference
while the tweet doesn't employ obvious sarcastic language or tone, the content itself could be seen as an indirect criticism of official narratives about 9/11. however, without more context or clearer indicators of sarcasm, it's difficult to definitively classify this as sarcastic. the tweet could be a genuine attempt to share information the author believes to be true.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the straightforward presentation of the information, i'm inclined to classify this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i acknowledge there's some ambiguity here, and additional context could potentially change this interpretation.",0
#Sarcasm makes you mentally stronger. Which is very effective when dealing with emotional #stress and #fustration.|#funfact #WhatIfISay,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""makes you mentally stronger"" and ""very effective"" suggest a positive outlook. the use of hashtags like #funfact also implies a lighthearted, informative tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are some clues that suggest this might not be entirely sincere:
1. the claim that sarcasm makes you mentally stronger is somewhat exaggerated.
2. the hashtag #whatifisay could be interpreted as hinting that the statement shouldn't be taken at face value.
3. the connection between sarcasm and dealing with emotional stress and frustration is not typically viewed as a straightforward or healthy coping mechanism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the exaggeration and the subtle hints (especially the #whatifisay hashtag) suggest that the true intention is to be ironic or sarcastic. the tweet appears to be playfully mocking the idea that sarcasm is a beneficial trait for mental health or stress management.

### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment given the analysis above.",1
Also it is funny how things at work get done when I'm on my off week #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""it is funny how"" often introduces a sarcastic statement.
2. the content describes a situation that's actually frustrating (things getting done when the person is away), not genuinely funny.
3. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic.

these elements, especially the explicit sarcasm hashtag, make it very clear that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1

When I'm lacking inspiration I resort to scribbling angry/pretty things. Great start to the week! #sarcasm http://t.co/5QUSrZYBqA,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification for the following reasons:

1. the tweet explicitly includes the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be read as sarcastic.

2. there's a contrast between the seemingly positive statement ""great start to the week!"" and the preceding description of ""scribbling angry/pretty things"" when lacking inspiration, which is typically not considered a great way to start a week.

3. the exclamation mark in ""great start to the week!"" adds emphasis that, in context, reads as overly enthusiastic and therefore likely sarcastic.

this combination of explicit labeling and contextual cues makes it highly likely that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
Also it's amazing how a shower and Taco Bell can make you feel like a new person. @TacoBellProbbs,0,"not sarcastic

'nuff #Bob #Couldn039t #Not #Repin #Ross #tattoo|Please RT: http://t.co/3npPprWgTh http://t.co/HNNHaANRAU,0,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as the content is not immediately clear in terms of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the text doesn't contain clear sentiment indicators. it's mostly hashtags and a call to retweet. the presence of ""bob ross"" might evoke positive feelings for some, as he's generally regarded positively. however, there's no explicit sentiment expressed.

step 2: true intention
the text appears to be promoting a bob ross-related tattoo image. the use of multiple hashtags and ""please rt"" suggests this is likely a sincere attempt to share and spread an image, rather than making a sarcastic comment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the text seems to be a straightforward attempt to share content, without any apparent irony or sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine attempt to share an image, likely of a bob ross-themed tattoo, without any sarcastic undertones.",0

"Heartless Sanghi #Sarcasm""@Retributions: #IndiawithPakistan because a dumb nation deserves to be taken for a ride again and again. #Lakhvi""",0,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the input text contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly included, which is a direct signal that the content is meant to be sarcastic.

2. the phrase ""heartless sanghi"" followed by ""#sarcasm"" suggests that the author is not actually calling someone heartless, but using sarcasm to make a point.

3. the quoted text includes ""#indiawithpakistan"" followed by negative sentiments about a ""dumb nation"" deserving to be ""taken for a ride."" this juxtaposition of seemingly supportive hashtag with critical content is a classic sarcastic structure.

4. the mention of ""#lakhvi"" (likely referring to zaki-ur-rehman lakhvi, a terrorist leader) in this context further reinforces the sarcastic tone, implying criticism of support for pakistan.

given these clear markers of sarcastic intent, particularly the explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag, the classification of this text as ""sarcastic"" is highly reliable.",1
I guess waking up every couple hours is cool |#not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""is cool,"" which typically indicates approval or appreciation.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed through several clues:
1. the phrase ""i guess"" often indicates skepticism or reluctance.
2. ""waking up every couple hours"" is generally considered an unpleasant experience.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating the previous statement.

step 3: the contrast between the superficially positive ""is cool"" and the reality of disturbed sleep, coupled with the explicit ""#not,"" clearly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to express frustration with poor sleep quality.

therefore, this statement is definitely sarcastic.",1
#Is #There #Too #Much to #Do or #Are #You #Not #Delegating #Enough ? http://t.co/9YaBomBF6c,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward question about time management and delegation, likely promoting an article or blog post on the topic. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the text. the use of hashtags for each word is unusual but doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. the content seems to be a genuine inquiry or prompt for reflection on productivity and leadership skills.",0
"@Boeing, @SpaceX told to stop work under crew contracts #irony http://t.co/1Hyb70IATA",1,"let's approach this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet appears to be a neutral news report about boeing and spacex being told to stop work under crew contracts. the hashtag ""#irony"" is included, which is a direct indicator of potential sarcasm or irony.

step 2: true intention
the inclusion of ""#irony"" suggests that the author finds something ironic about this situation. in the context of space exploration and contracts, it's likely that the author is pointing out a perceived contradiction or unexpected turn of events in the space industry.

step 3: analysis and inference
the use of ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author intends this tweet to be interpreted as sarcastic or ironic. while the content of the news itself is not inherently sarcastic, the author's framing of it with the irony hashtag transforms the message into a sarcastic commentary on the situation.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of the ""#irony"" hashtag is a strong indicator that the author intends this tweet to be interpreted as sarcastic, even though the main content is a straightforward news statement.",1
I need to get out of this car before I kill my dad.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the phrase ""before i kill my dad,"" which suggests extreme frustration or anger. the need to ""get out of this car"" also implies a desire to escape an uncomfortable situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to align with the surface sentiment. this statement likely expresses genuine frustration or irritation with being in a car with the speaker's father. the hyperbole ""before i kill my dad"" is probably not meant literally, but rather as an exaggerated expression of intense annoyance.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement is a straightforward expression of frustration without any apparent irony or contradiction that would indicate sarcasm. the exaggeration is used for emphasis rather than to convey the opposite meaning.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration rather than a sarcastic remark.",0

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to break it down step-by-step. the tweet appears to be a straightforward description of christmas decorating progress, with no apparent sarcastic elements. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) seems casual rather than sarcastic, and the rest of the content, including hashtags and emoji, reinforce a genuine, positive sentiment about decorating for christmas.",0
Look good feel good! #not #TeamNoSleep #cantopeneyes,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""look good feel good!"" initially suggests a positive sentiment. however, the hashtags that follow contradict this positivity:
- ""#not"" implies negation
- ""#teamnosleep"" suggests lack of sleep
- ""#cantopeneyes"" indicates extreme tiredness

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing exhaustion and the opposite of feeling or looking good. the initial positive phrase is undermined by the hashtags, which paint a picture of someone who is extremely tired and struggling.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the upbeat ""look good feel good!"" and the reality described in the hashtags creates a sarcastic tone. the author is likely using irony to emphasize how bad they actually feel or look due to lack of sleep.

### label: sarcastic

the juxtaposition of the positive statement with contradictory hashtags clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is humorously highlighting the discrepancy between the ideal of looking and feeling good and their actual exhausted state.",1
How much did it cost to build #mygov #medicare? I see this way too often... http://t.co/N0Pdpiq1RQ,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the question ""how much did it cost to build #mygov #medicare?"" seems like a straightforward inquiry. the follow-up statement ""i see this way too often..."" suggests some frustration or criticism, but it's not overtly positive or negative.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism or frustration with a government service. the question about cost is likely rhetorical, implying that the service is expensive. the phrase ""i see this way too often"" coupled with the link suggests that the author is pointing out a recurring issue or failure with the system.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral, the underlying intention appears to be critical. the use of a rhetorical question followed by a comment about frequency suggests that the author is using subtle sarcasm to express disappointment or criticism about the government service.

given this analysis, i believe this tweet is likely sarcastic, using a seemingly innocent question to imply criticism of government spending or inefficiency.

### label: sarcastic",1
That sad moment you realize you're past the point of having all those presents under the tree. I wanna move back in.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or sad. key phrases indicating this:
- ""sad moment""
- ""realize you're past the point""
- ""i wanna move back in"" (implying dissatisfaction with current situation)

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be a genuine expression of nostalgia and a bittersweet realization about growing up. the author is likely an adult reminiscing about childhood christmases. the desire to ""move back in"" is probably a metaphorical way of expressing a wish to return to childhood innocence and excitement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is sad, it aligns with the true intention. there doesn't appear to be any contradiction between the literal words and the intended meaning. the statement is straightforward and heartfelt, without any indicators of irony or sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the text expresses a genuine sentiment about growing up and missing childhood experiences, particularly around christmas. there's no evidence of sarcasm or irony in the statement.",0
"So I may have had a ""few"" empties to recycle... ♻♻ |I ?#craftbeer http://t.co/qlZbtAcmOx",0,"sarcastic

i believe this tweet is sarcastic, and i'm confident in this judgment. here's my reasoning:

the key sarcastic element is the use of quotation marks around ""few"" when referring to empty bottles to recycle. this suggests the opposite of what is literally being said - that there are actually many empty bottles, not just a few. 

the recycling emojis and hashtag about craft beer further support this interpretation, implying the person has consumed a substantial amount of beer.

the overall tone is one of humorous self-deprecation about excessive drinking, using understatement (""few"") ironically to highlight the large number of empties. this mismatch between the literal words and the implied meaning is a classic marker of sarcasm.",1
"@PoliticalAnt @emthedivine @mark3labs @elyse4design @chixenman @Morning_Joe yet in Ferguson, MO the mayor and Gov are Dems. #irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet mentions ""#irony"" which is often associated with sarcasm. it also points out a seeming contradiction between the political affiliation of leaders in ferguson, mo (democrats) and an implied expectation.

step 2: true intention
the author is likely pointing out that despite the democratic leadership in ferguson, mo (typically associated with more liberal or progressive policies), there were still issues that led to protests and unrest. the use of ""#irony"" suggests that the author finds this situation contradictory or unexpected.

step 3: analysis and inference
the surface use of ""#irony"" combined with the pointed observation about democratic leadership in a troubled area strongly suggests that the author is being sarcastic. they're implying that democratic leadership should have prevented such issues, but didn't, which they find ironic.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" and the context of the tweet strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment about the political situation in ferguson, mo.",1
Abnormal professor walks in with the finals in a Zoloft bag #irony #psychhumor,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly humorous. the text describes a professor bringing finals in a zoloft bag, which is an unusual scenario. the hashtags #irony and #psychhumor indicate that this is meant to be funny or ironic.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to create humor by juxtaposing the serious nature of final exams with a medication typically used for depression and anxiety. the use of ""abnormal professor"" and the zoloft bag (an antidepressant) creates a contrast that's meant to be amusing. the hashtags explicitly state that this is intended as irony and psychological humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface description is straightforward, the true intention is to create a humorous situation through irony. the juxtaposition of finals (typically causing stress for students) with antidepressants (zoloft) is deliberately incongruous. this incongruity, combined with the explicit use of #irony, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the use of irony, the deliberate juxtaposition of contrasting elements, and the explicit labeling with #irony all point towards this being a sarcastic statement.",1
@theandrewe in hereford but can't leave bambino alone!,0,"not sarcastic

this message appears to be a straightforward statement without any sarcastic elements. the user is explaining that they are in hereford but can't leave their ""bambino"" (likely referring to a child or pet) alone. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems genuine and matter-of-fact.",0
@grimmers skiing in Regents Park much #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to positive. ""skiing in regents park"" could be seen as a fun activity. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a potential clue, but let's analyze further.

step 2: true intention
several elements suggest this tweet is not meant to be taken literally:
1. regents park is in london, a city not known for skiing conditions.
2. the ""@grimmers"" suggests this is directed at someone, possibly teasing them.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to indicate sarcasm or that the opposite of what was said is true.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of a fun skiing activity contrasts sharply with the reality that skiing in regents park is not possible. the ""#not"" confirms that the tweet is meant to be understood as the opposite of what it literally says.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is using sarcasm to likely comment on poor weather conditions or perhaps someone's unrealistic plans. the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcastic intent.",1
Rejoice in knowing he is now in his new place...#not easy,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""rejoice,"" which typically indicates joy or celebration. however, this is immediately followed by ""...#not easy,"" which introduces a contrasting negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement seems to be expressing sadness or difficulty coping with someone's passing. the phrase ""he is now in his new place"" is likely a euphemism for someone having died. the hashtag ""#not easy"" at the end confirms that this situation is difficult for the speaker.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the opening word ""rejoice"" initially suggests a positive sentiment, the overall context and the concluding hashtag reveal that the speaker is actually struggling with a loss. the use of ""rejoice"" in this context is not meant to be taken literally, but rather serves to highlight the contrast between how one might be expected to feel (acceptance or even happiness that the deceased is in a ""better place"") and the actual difficulty of the situation.

given this analysis, i can conclude that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is using ""rejoice"" ironically to emphasize how challenging it is to find joy in such a situation.

### label: sarcastic",1
"When ""make dua for me bro"" turns into an hour long conversation",0,"to analyze this input carefully, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""make dua for me bro"" suggests a friendly, supportive interaction. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing mild frustration or amusement at how a simple request for prayer (""make dua for me"") unexpectedly turns into a much longer conversation. the contrast between the expected brief interaction and the actual lengthy outcome is the key point here.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral or positive, the true intention reveals a gentle criticism or observation about social interactions. the speaker is likely using understatement and irony to convey their point. this subtle mismatch between the surface meaning and the underlying intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses a mild form of sarcasm to comment on how a simple request can lead to an unexpectedly long conversation, highlighting the irony in social interactions.",1
"@_Liam_Walker_ @TheOxfordMail A thief, a liar, a vote rigger, mocks those who use food banks and an online bully #irony",0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text lists negative traits and actions: ""thief"", ""liar"", ""vote rigger"", ""mocks those who use food banks"", and ""online bully"". these are all strongly negative descriptors.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the author doesn't mean this statement literally. in social media, hashtags are often used to provide context or commentary on the main text.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the stark contrast between the negative descriptors and the ""#irony"" hashtag strongly suggests sarcasm. the author is likely criticizing someone (possibly a public figure) by sarcastically attributing these negative traits to them, then explicitly marking it as irony to ensure the sarcastic intent is clear.

the use of sarcasm to criticize or mock is a common rhetorical device, especially in political or social commentary on social media platforms.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this text.",1
"What the hell has happened to Shahid Afridi in last couple of days? Left alone more bouncers than played, got a review right. #pakvnz",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or critical. key phrases like ""what the hell has happened"" and ""left alone more bouncers than played"" suggest disappointment or criticism of shahid afridi's recent performance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing surprise or disbelief, but in a humorous or ironic way. the tweet points out unusual behaviors for afridi (leaving bouncers, getting a review right), implying these are out of character for him. the hashtag #pakvnz suggests this is commentary during a cricket match.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is critical, the true intention appears to be using humor and irony to comment on afridi's unexpected behavior. the contrast between the typical expectations of afridi's play style and the described actions creates a sarcastic tone. the author is likely a cricket fan using sarcasm to highlight the unusual nature of afridi's recent performance.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to comment on the unexpected changes in shahid afridi's cricket performance, making light of the situation through ironic observations.",1
Sub is making class go by so slow that I feel like I am losing brain cells. #irony #substitute #MoveitAlong,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""going by so slow"" and ""losing brain cells"" indicate frustration and boredom. the hashtags #irony and #moveitalong further emphasize dissatisfaction with the situation.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author is employing sarcasm. the exaggeration of ""losing brain cells"" is likely not meant literally, but to emphasize how tedious and unproductive the class feels. the author is using hyperbole to express their frustration with the substitute teacher's pace.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the use of ""#irony"" and exaggerated language suggests that the author is deliberately using sarcasm to convey their message. the true intention is to humorously criticize the slow pace of the class under the substitute teacher.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of ""#irony"" and the exaggerated language strongly indicate that this tweet is sarcastic in nature, despite its seemingly straightforward negative sentiment.",1

@HayekandHockey Yeah someone with Hayek and hockey in their name calling someone racist #irony @Txrebel05,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the use of ""#irony"" suggests the author is pointing out something contradictory or unexpected. there's no overtly positive or negative language, but the implication of calling someone ""racist"" is generally negative.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be calling out perceived hypocrisy or irony. the author is suggesting that someone with ""hayek"" (likely referring to friedrich hayek, a classical liberal economist) in their username is accusing others of racism, which the author finds ironic or contradictory.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment doesn't immediately scream sarcasm, but the use of ""#irony"" is a strong indicator that the author is being sarcastic. they're not directly stating their opinion, but rather pointing out what they see as a contradiction in someone else's behavior. the sarcasm lies in the implication that someone who admires hayek (often associated with libertarian or conservative views) shouldn't be calling others racist, or that doing so is hypocritical.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""#irony"" and the overall structure of the tweet strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment about perceived hypocrisy.",1

@IsaJennie @deray @Nettaaaaaaaa but of course it was. Cops could shoot a black man in front of a hospital & I bet you he'd still get no aid.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""cops could shoot a black man"" and ""he'd still get no aid"" indicate a harsh view of police treatment of black individuals. the tone seems angry and accusatory.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and highlight perceived racial injustice in policing and healthcare. the author is using hyperbole and an extreme hypothetical scenario to emphasize their point about systemic racism. the phrase ""but of course it was"" at the beginning suggests a resigned, bitter acknowledgment of an expected negative outcome.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment and true intention align in being critical, the use of exaggeration and the bitter, resigned tone suggest sarcasm. the author isn't literally predicting this scenario, but using it as a rhetorical device to express frustration with racial inequalities. the sarcasm lies in the exaggerated example and the mock certainty (""i bet you"") about such an extreme outcome.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses sarcasm to make a point about racial injustice, employing exaggeration and a bitter tone to emphasize the author's criticism of systemic racism in law enforcement and healthcare.",1
I love it when people ignore me. #sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

this is a clear-cut case of sarcasm, so i can confidently provide the label without going through the step-by-step process. the reasons for this classification are:

1. the statement expresses a positive sentiment (""i love it"") about something that is generally considered negative or unpleasant (being ignored).

2. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.

these elements together make it unambiguous that the text is sarcastic, hence the classification as ""sarcastic"".",1
"Every you're a fucking cunt, lying cunt did I say cunt song is about you now. How cute is that #defo #not #pissed #off #nope",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as it requires careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears quite negative and angry. the use of profanity (""fucking cunt,"" repeated ""cunt"") indicates strong negative emotions. however, the ending hashtags ""#defo #not #pissed #off #nope"" and the phrase ""how cute is that"" seem to contradict this negative tone with a seemingly positive or dismissive attitude.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing anger and frustration, likely towards someone the speaker feels has wronged them. the statement about every song being about the person is probably an exaggeration. the contradictory hashtags at the end are almost certainly not meant to be taken at face value, but rather as a sarcastic contradiction of the speaker's true feelings.

step 3: compare and analyze
the stark contrast between the angry, profanity-laden main text and the seemingly casual, dismissive hashtags at the end is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the phrase ""how cute is that"" in this context is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but as a sarcastic remark. the hashtags ""#not #pissed #off #nope"" are saying the opposite of what the speaker truly means, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses sarcasm to express anger and frustration while pretending to be unbothered, creating a clear sarcastic tone.",1
"@kaylakrebs5 not you, you're on pain medications 😂",0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be humorous or light-hearted. the use of the laughing emoji (😂) suggests a jovial tone. the phrase ""not you"" could be interpreted as reassuring or excluding the person from a negative statement.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be a playful jab or teasing remark. the mention of ""you're on pain medications"" implies that the person's judgment or perception might be impaired, but it's said in a way that doesn't seem genuinely concerned or serious.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there's a subtle mismatch. while the tone is light and humorous on the surface, there's an underlying implication that the person's state of mind is altered due to medication. this gentle mockery wrapped in a seemingly friendly comment is characteristic of mild sarcasm.

given this analysis, i would classify this as:

### label: sarcastic

the comment uses a light-hearted tone to teasingly suggest that the person's judgment is impaired due to medication, which is a form of gentle sarcasm.",1
What a great Christmas. 😅 #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as there are multiple elements to consider:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""what a great christmas"" on its own appears positive.
- the laughing/sweating emoji (😅) adds an element of nervousness or discomfort.
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end directly contradicts the initial positive statement.

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""great"" is likely meant ironically, given the contradictory elements.
- the nervous emoji suggests the speaker is actually uncomfortable or unhappy.
- the ""#not"" hashtag is a clear indicator that the speaker means the opposite of what they initially said.

step 3: analysis and inference
- the surface positive sentiment (""great christmas"") is deliberately contradicted by the emoji and hashtag.
- this contradiction between the stated positive and implied negative is a classic sarcastic structure.
- the speaker is using irony to express that their christmas was actually not great at all.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1
i hate waking up in the mornings 😒#basicbrianna #not #an #early #bird,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of dislike for waking up early, rather than a sarcastic statement. the use of the annoyed face emoji (😒) and hashtags like ""#not #an #early #bird"" reinforce the literal meaning of the statement. the phrase ""basicbrianna"" seems to be a self-deprecating reference to sharing a common sentiment, but it doesn't introduce sarcasm to the overall message. the tweet is expressing a genuine feeling without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would contradict the surface sentiment.",0
"@clairebag8 yeah amazing night, I think he out till the death! I'll let u know xx",0,"not sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the text appears to be a genuine, enthusiastic response about a night out. the phrase ""amazing night"" is used sincerely, and the casual, friendly tone of the message (including the use of ""xx"" at the end, which typically indicates affection or friendliness) suggests that the sender is genuinely positive about the experience. there are no indications of sarcasm or hidden negative meanings in this message.",0
I wish I did better in high school,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of regret or wishful thinking about past academic performance. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony present. the speaker is directly and sincerely expressing a wish to have performed better in high school, which is a common sentiment many people have when reflecting on their past.",0
At the Toys for Lil Troops event for @USVeteransCorps donating toys to children of deployed and low income troops. http://t.co/IBkWl858EE,0,"not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this tweet appears to be a straightforward statement about participating in a charitable event. the content describes donating toys to children of deployed and low-income troops at an event called ""toys for lil troops."" there are no indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meanings in this message. the tone seems sincere and informative, simply reporting on attendance at a charitable activity. the inclusion of the organization name (@usveteranscorps) and a link to what's likely an image or more information about the event further supports the genuine nature of this statement. therefore, this tweet can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0
The song was 'don't cry for me Argentina' #irony,1,"sarcastic

i'm fairly confident in this classification, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. the text simply states a fact about a song title without any obvious emotional indicators.

step 2: true intention
the inclusion of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear signal that the speaker intends this statement to be understood ironically or sarcastically. this hashtag is commonly used on social media to explicitly mark sarcastic or ironic statements.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text is neutral, the ""#irony"" tag transforms the meaning. it suggests that the speaker is using the song title ""don't cry for me argentina"" in a context where it's ironically inappropriate or contradictory to the actual situation. without more context, we can't know exactly what situation the speaker is referring to, but the use of the irony hashtag clearly indicates sarcastic intent.

given this analysis, particularly the explicit use of ""#irony"", i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.",1
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/MNIM6Qa5BE The Ubisoft Graduate Program - Gameplay Programming,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward share of a youtube video about the ubisoft graduate program focusing on gameplay programming. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the language is neutral and informative, simply stating that the user liked a video and providing the link and title. this type of content sharing is common on social media platforms and doesn't contain any elements that would suggest sarcastic intent.",0
I wonder how many people who visit food banks have huge TVs or are drunks? #freedomofspeech #foodbanks,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine question or wondering about people who use food banks. the use of hashtags #freedomofspeech and #foodbanks seems to frame this as a serious inquiry or commentary.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention appears to be quite different:
- the question implies a negative stereotype about people who use food banks, suggesting they might be irresponsible (having ""huge tvs"") or have substance abuse issues (""drunks"").
- the use of ""i wonder"" is likely rhetorical, not a genuine inquiry.
- the hashtag #freedomofspeech suggests the speaker is aware that this opinion might be controversial or offensive.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface question contrasts sharply with the underlying implication. the tweet is not actually seeking information but rather making a judgmental statement about food bank users. the use of stereotypes and the implied criticism show that this is not a sincere question but a way to express a negative opinion about people in need.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

while the tweet is certainly provocative and potentially offensive, it doesn't appear to be using sarcasm. the speaker seems to be expressing a genuine, albeit controversial, opinion rather than saying the opposite of what they mean (which would be characteristic of sarcasm).",0
"#Alien dit : What is #Religion, it is a culture that has been invented by a #Fool who wanted to do everything that is #Not legal #Legally..",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this case is somewhat nuanced:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative towards religion. key phrases like ""invented by a #fool"" and associating religion with doing illegal things legally suggest a critical view of religion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a satirical or cynical commentary on religion. the use of hashtags and the somewhat exaggerated statement suggest the author is making a pointed critique rather than a straightforward factual claim. the structure ""what is #religion, it is..."" mimics an explanatory tone but delivers a harsh criticism.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment and true intention both appear critical of religion, the exaggerated nature of the statement, the use of hashtags for emphasis, and the provocative claim about religion being a way to do illegal things legally all point to a sarcastic tone. the author is using hyperbole and a mock-definition format to make a satirical point about religion.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses exaggeration and a mocking tone to criticize religion, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. it's not a straightforward criticism but employs satirical elements to make its point.",1
Lazying about in a hoody #WinterTimes,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward description of someone's relaxed winter activity. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the phrase ""lazying about in a hoody"" is a casual way of describing comfortable, relaxed behavior, which is often associated with colder weather and staying indoors. the hashtag ""#wintertimes"" further reinforces that this is a genuine description of winter-related behavior. the tone is neutral and descriptive, without any apparent irony or contrast between surface meaning and true intention that would suggest sarcasm.",0
Forgot to enter #sarcasm,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral. the phrase ""forgot to enter #sarcasm"" doesn't contain any obvious emotional keywords or sentiment indicators.

step 2: the true intention of this statement is actually to indicate that the previous statement or context (which we don't have) was indeed sarcastic. by saying they ""forgot"" to add the #sarcasm hashtag, the speaker is implicitly stating that their previous comment should be interpreted as sarcasm.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that while the surface text doesn't appear sarcastic, the underlying meaning is to indicate sarcasm. this meta-commentary on sarcasm is itself a form of sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to point out that their sarcasm should have been obvious without needing a hashtag.

therefore, this statement is classified as ""sarcastic"". it's a self-referential joke about sarcasm, which is inherently sarcastic in nature.",1
"#A #tax #per mile? #Americans #should #not #allow #GPS #tracking #of #cars, #trucks: Watch out ?as the new year... http://t.co/h1CuMqrFfZ",0,"since this tweet requires some analysis and context understanding, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative and cautionary. keywords like ""should not allow,"" ""watch out,"" and the use of multiple hashtags suggest a warning or alert tone. there's no overtly positive language or emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the tweet is warning about a potential new tax per mile and gps tracking of vehicles. it's urging americans to be vigilant and oppose such measures. the link at the end likely leads to more information about this issue.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the tweet is straightforwardly expressing concern and opposition to a potential policy. there are no obvious indicators of irony or sarcasm, such as exaggeration or mock enthusiasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of concern about a policy issue, without any detectable sarcastic elements.",0
Long distance relationships are serious SH*t #not ayoba...,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""serious sh*t"" is often used to describe something difficult or unpleasant. the hashtag ""#not ayoba"" (where ""ayoba"" is south african slang for ""cool"" or ""awesome"") further reinforces a negative sentiment.

step 2: the true intention of this sentence seems to be expressing genuine frustration or difficulty with long-distance relationships. the use of strong language (""serious sh*t"") and the explicit negation in the hashtag suggest that the speaker is being direct and sincere about their feelings.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the speaker is expressing a negative opinion about long-distance relationships in a straightforward manner, without any apparent irony or contradiction that would indicate sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration about long-distance relationships rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
Happy Birthday to me! #imgettinold #not #ionlygetbetter ROLL TIDE! http://t.co/v8tWnYJJPB,1,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and celebratory. key indicators:
- ""happy birthday to me!"" - expressing joy
- ""roll tide!"" - an enthusiastic exclamation
- use of exclamation marks
- hashtags like ""#ionlygetbetter"" suggest a positive outlook

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- ""#imgettinold"" could be seen as self-deprecating humor
- ""#not"" immediately following ""#imgettinold"" negates the previous statement, indicating the person doesn't actually feel old
- ""roll tide!"" is a supportive cheer, likely genuine
- the overall tone seems lighthearted and genuinely positive

step 3: comparison and final inference
while there's a hint of self-deprecating humor with ""#imgettinold"", it's immediately negated with ""#not"". the overall message appears to be genuinely celebratory and positive about aging. the use of hashtags and exclamations seems more playful than sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of birthday celebration with a touch of playful self-awareness about aging, but without crossing into sarcasm.",0
We are MAD Gamers: http://t.co/QeupePJi6K | Follow @BlitzndizGaming #Wellington #NewZealand http://t.co/b3f83j2SAD,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message for a gaming group or community. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the text is simply sharing information about ""mad gamers"" with a link, encouraging people to follow a related account, and using hashtags for visibility. the tone is informative and promotional rather than sarcastic or ironic.",0
So not okay with DB's racist jokes.,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of disapproval towards racist jokes, without any indicators of sarcasm. the phrase ""so not okay"" is a clear and direct way of expressing strong disagreement or disapproval. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker seems to be genuinely expressing their discomfort or disagreement with racist jokes made by ""db"" (likely referring to a person or entity). therefore, this statement can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0
"#notcies #eu European Council: Press conference by Donald TUSK, Jean-Claude JUNCKER,, and Matteo RENZI, http://t.co/hHXQv23u65",0,"not sarcastic

i can output this result directly with high confidence. the input text appears to be a straightforward announcement or news update about a press conference by european union officials. it contains no sarcastic elements, emotional language, or rhetorical devices that would suggest sarcasm. the content is factual and informative in nature, typical of a news or official communication tweet.",0
@Metri_HennyKing u bragged all yr about having Peyton in 2 leagues only to get beat in the 1st round in both #irony 😂😂😂😂,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the use of ""bragged"" and laughing emojis (😂😂😂😂) suggests a positive or amused tone. the hashtag #irony is also present.

step 2: true intention
the tweet is actually mocking someone (@metri_hennyking) for bragging about having peyton manning in two fantasy football leagues, only to lose in the first round of both leagues. the true intention is to point out the irony of the situation and make fun of the person's overconfidence.

step 3: analysis and label
the surface sentiment (amusement) contrasts with the underlying critical message. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals sarcasm. the laughing emojis are used not to express genuine amusement, but to mock the person being addressed. 

these factors clearly indicate that the tweet is sarcastic, using irony to criticize and mock someone's misplaced confidence.",1
"The feeling you get, when you just wanna flip the table and screw the finals.",0,"since i'm not entirely confident in making an immediate judgment, i'll think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or frustrated. key phrases like ""wanna flip the table"" and ""screw the finals"" indicate strong negative emotions, stress, and a desire to give up or rebel against the situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing genuine frustration and stress about finals. the language is casual and direct, without obvious irony or contradiction. it appears to be a straightforward expression of feeling overwhelmed and wanting to abandon one's responsibilities.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement is expressing a negative sentiment in a direct, albeit somewhat hyperbolic, manner. there's no indication of saying one thing but meaning another, which is typical of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration rather than a sarcastic comment. it uses exaggerated language to convey stress about finals, but it doesn't seem to be saying the opposite of what it means or using irony to make a point.",0
They working me so hard tonite,0,"to provide a more accurate classification, i'll think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the phrase ""working me so hard,"" which typically implies exhaustion or overwork. the use of ""tonite"" (tonight) adds emphasis to the current situation.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, there are a few elements that suggest this might not be entirely straightforward:
1. the informal spelling of ""tonite"" could indicate a casual or playful tone.
2. there's no additional context or complaint, which is unusual for a genuine grievance about overwork.
3. the statement is quite brief and lacks detail, which can sometimes be a marker of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the casual tone and lack of detail make it difficult to determine if this is a genuine complaint or a sarcastic comment. it could be interpreted either way:
- it might be a genuine statement from someone who is actually working hard.
- it could be a sarcastic comment from someone who isn't actually busy but is exaggerating for effect.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcasm markers, i'm inclined to err on the side of taking the statement at face value.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification is made with less than 90% confidence due to the potential for sarcasm that can't be ruled out without more context.",0
@francescapinder @girlposts this vine won't come up 😫😫😫,0,"not sarcastic

Jeez I wish the government paid for my food. #not #EBTbitches,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or wishful due to the phrase ""i wish"". however, the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#ebtbitches"" introduce a negative tone. the use of ""jeez"" as an interjection also suggests some frustration or annoyance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking people who receive government food assistance (ebt, or electronic benefit transfer). the phrase ""i wish"" is likely not genuine but used ironically. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly negates the surface wish, while ""#ebtbitches"" is a derogatory term for people using food stamps.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of wishing for government assistance is contradicted by the true intention of criticizing those who receive it. the use of irony (saying the opposite of what is meant) and the mocking tone indicated by the hashtags strongly suggest sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
"Hey @Enasni, some of your geeky/nerdy followers need #sarcasm marker on posts like that. Otherwise, they'll start doing exactly the same :)",0,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

this tweet contains subtle indicators of sarcasm, though it's not overtly sarcastic itself. the key elements that suggest sarcasm are:

1. the mention of needing a ""#sarcasm marker"" implies the original post by @enasni was likely sarcastic.

2. the humorous implication that without such a marker, ""geeky/nerdy followers"" would take the post literally and ""start doing exactly the same"".

3. the use of a smiley face emoticon "":)"" at the end, which often accompanies light-hearted or playful comments.

while the surface sentiment appears to be giving friendly advice, the underlying message is poking fun at the literal-mindedness of certain followers, using gentle mockery wrapped in a seemingly helpful suggestion. this disconnect between the surface message and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, while subtle, this tweet can be classified as sarcastic in nature.",1
Pretty Shitty day I'm gonna be soaked and full of mud and clay #iliketogetdirty #notreally #sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

i can confidently classify this as sarcastic without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the use of hashtags ""#notreally"" and ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the text explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically. the author is using these hashtags to clarify that their apparent enthusiasm for getting dirty (expressed in ""#iliketogetdirty"") is not genuine, but rather a sarcastic comment on an unpleasant situation they're facing.",1
"when you refer to yourself in the plural, you'll get that @RBRNetwork1 @billvanglahn @HondoLane @Dolphin__Man @jus1314tin @SpringThunder",0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward piece of advice or observation without any apparent sarcastic elements. the speaker is directly addressing a group of people about how they refer to themselves, likely in the context of social media communication. there are no obvious rhetorical devices or conflicting sentiments that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than mocking or ironic, which are typical hallmarks of sarcasm.",0
That moment when the ad plays flawlessly but the video keeps buffering #irony #YouTube @YouTube,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive, with phrases like ""that moment when"" often used to highlight relatable experiences.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear when we consider the full context:
- the user is pointing out the irony (explicitly using #irony) of ads playing perfectly while the actual content buffers.
- this highlights a frustrating user experience where the unwanted part (ads) works flawlessly, but the desired content (video) doesn't.
- the use of hashtags like #irony and tagging @youtube further emphasizes the critical nature of the comment.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, it's evident that the seemingly neutral surface sentiment masks a criticism of youtube's performance. the user is using sarcasm to express frustration about the platform prioritizing ad delivery over content playback.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic"". the tweet uses irony to criticize youtube's service quality, making it a clear example of sarcasm.",1
Gotta love a Romanian playing an improvised version of jingle bells in a minor key. Really sets the festive mood. #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. key phrases like ""gotta love"" and ""sets the festive mood"" suggest appreciation and enjoyment. the description of a unique musical performance (romanian musician, improvised jingle bells in minor key) seems to convey interest and enthusiasm.

step 2: true intention
however, several elements hint at a different true intention:
1. the contrast between the cheerful ""jingle bells"" and a minor key, which typically sounds somber.
2. the phrase ""really sets the festive mood"" when paired with a somber musical description suggests irony.
3. most tellingly, the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating everything said before it.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention is clearly the opposite. the author is using irony to express that this musical performance is actually not enjoyable or festive at all. the ""#not"" hashtag confirms this interpretation.

### label: sarcastic",1
Perfect time to get sick 😢 #not,1,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""perfect time"" initially seems positive, but it's followed by ""to get sick"" which is negative. there's also a crying emoji 😢 which expresses sadness or frustration.

step 2: true intention
the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the speaker means the opposite of what they're literally saying. this is a common way to express sarcasm online.

step 3: analysis
the surface sentiment tries to frame getting sick as happening at a ""perfect time,"" which is clearly not true. the sad emoji and especially the ""#not"" hashtag confirm that the speaker is being sarcastic. they're actually expressing frustration at getting sick at an inconvenient time.

therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic.",1
I'm giving up a lot of stuff to make sure others are happy . I wonder if anyone ever look past my appearance and see what I'm feeling 😩,0,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as the sentiment is complex and requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and somewhat frustrated. key indicators:
- ""giving up a lot of stuff"" suggests sacrifice
- ""wonder if anyone ever look past my appearance"" implies feeling misunderstood or undervalued
- the use of the 😩 emoji, which typically conveys exasperation or tiredness

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the person appears to be genuinely expressing:
- frustration at making sacrifices for others
- a desire to be understood beyond their physical appearance
- feeling emotionally drained or unappreciated

there don't appear to be any clear rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would suggest the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention seem to align. there's no apparent contradiction or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm. the statement appears to be a sincere expression of emotional struggle and a desire for deeper understanding from others.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine expression of frustration and longing for understanding, without any indicators of sarcasm.",0

I see the #irony of MY LAST 3 TWEETS COMBINED was lost entirely on a certain someone... Faith in humanity: -3% :(,0,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- ""faith in humanity: -3% :("" indicating disappointment
- use of all caps for emphasis on ""my last 3 tweets combined""
- mention of irony being ""lost entirely""

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration and sarcasm:
- explicitly mentioning ""#irony""
- referring to ""a certain someone"" not understanding the irony
- exaggerated decrease in ""faith in humanity""
- the dramatic tone and structure of the tweet

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the exaggerated language and explicit mention of irony strongly suggest this is a sarcastic statement. the author is using sarcasm to express frustration at someone not understanding their previous tweets' irony.

given these factors, i'm confident in classifying this as ""sarcastic.""",1
Lol hilarious pic RT @WizGameEnt: What a game! @WashWizards win! http://t.co/9BJVI8V4Hx,0,"not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of excitement and enjoyment about a basketball game, rather than sarcasm. the use of ""lol hilarious pic"" and ""what a game!"" are consistent with sincere enthusiasm for the washington wizards' win. the inclusion of a link to what is likely a celebratory image or video further supports the non-sarcastic nature of the tweet. in this context, the language is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony.",0

"Change is a Process, ||#Not an Event dafuq you thinking",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the first part of the sentence ""change is a process, not an event"" appears to be a straightforward, somewhat motivational statement. however, the addition of ""dafuq you thinking"" at the end introduces a sudden shift in tone that's crude and confrontational.

step 2: true intention
the core message about change being a process seems to be genuinely meant. the abrupt addition of ""dafuq you thinking"" suggests frustration or exasperation, likely directed at someone who may have expected change to happen quickly or instantly. this crude expression seems to emphasize the point rather than contradict it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the sudden shift in language might initially seem like it could be sarcastic, the overall message remains consistent. the crude expression serves to emphasize the point rather than undermine it. the speaker appears to be genuinely frustrated with someone's misunderstanding of the nature of change, rather than using sarcasm to convey an opposite meaning.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement, despite its abrupt shift in tone, maintains a consistent message throughout and doesn't appear to be using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. the crude expression at the end serves to emphasize the point rather than contradict it, making this statement not sarcastic.",0
My son gave me a cold......again!!! Yay! #sarcasm #NotExcitedAboutThisShitAtAll,1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of ""yay!"" in a context where getting sick is obviously not a positive thing.
2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic.
3. the contrasting hashtag ""#notexcitedaboutthisshitatall"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone by stating the true feelings directly.

the surface excitement (""yay!"") is intentionally contrasted with the actual negative sentiment about getting sick, which is a classic sarcastic structure. the explicit labeling with ""#sarcasm"" removes any doubt about the intended tone.",1
"A #sale is #not #something you #pursue, it's #what #happens to you #while you are #immersed in #serving your... http://t.co/ojFVxXxilw",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine piece of business advice or motivational content rather than sarcasm. the use of hashtags and the partial url at the end suggest it's likely a sincere social media post sharing a business philosophy or sales insight. the message conveys a positive sentiment about focusing on service rather than pursuing sales directly, which is a common perspective in modern business thinking. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would indicate sarcasm.",0
"@zainabimam ""Malala is fake and planted by the US coz Pakistan is perfectly safe for kids going to school"" #PeshawarAttack #Sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive about pakistan's safety for schoolchildren, with the statement ""pakistan is perfectly safe for kids going to school.""

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly the opposite. the context of the #peshawarattack hashtag (referring to a tragic terrorist attack on a school in pakistan) and the explicit #sarcasm hashtag indicate that the statement is not meant to be taken literally. the claim about malala being ""fake and planted by the us"" is also an extreme statement that's likely not meant seriously.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there's a clear mismatch. the tweet is using irony to highlight the dangerous reality for schoolchildren in pakistan, in direct contrast to the literal words used. the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag removes any doubt.

therefore, the tweet is definitively sarcastic.",1
Seriously has the #BBL04 got the tallest on ground interviewers of all time #talltowers #sevenfoot,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or impressed. keywords like ""seriously"" and hashtags like ""#talltowers"" and ""#sevenfoot"" suggest genuine amazement at the height of the interviewers.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be exaggeration for humorous effect. the use of ""seriously"" as an opener and the hyperbolic hashtags ""#talltowers"" and ""#sevenfoot"" suggest the author is playfully overstating the interviewers' height.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears genuine, the exaggerated language and playful tone suggest that the author is not being entirely serious. the contrast between the seemingly earnest question and the hyperbolic description points towards a sarcastic intent.

### label: sarcastic

the text is likely meant to be a humorous, exaggerated observation about the interviewers' height, using sarcasm to make the point.",1
#Funny #18+ Turn On aquabreeze:||disgustinghotels:||#not all men http://t.co/F4OEPX8uob,0,"given the input text, i don't have enough confidence to make a direct judgment, so i'll analyze it step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is unclear. the use of ""#funny"" suggests humor, while ""#18+"" implies adult content. ""turn on"" could be positive, but ""disgustinghotels"" is negative. ""#not all men"" is a commonly used phrase in social discourse, often with mixed connotations.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is difficult to determine without more context. the mix of hashtags and phrases seems disjointed. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/f4oepx8uob) suggests this might be sharing content rather than expressing a clear opinion. the phrase ""#not all men"" is often used sarcastically to critique defensive responses to discussions about sexism, but it's not clear if that's the intention here.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the lack of a clear narrative or sentiment makes it challenging to determine if sarcasm is present. the juxtaposition of ""funny"" with ""disgustinghotels"" could potentially be sarcastic, but it's not definitive. the ""#not all men"" could be used sarcastically, but without more context, we can't be certain.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i'm inclined to err on the side of caution.

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification has low confidence due to the fragmented nature of the text and lack of clear context.",0
Yay jury duty 😒 #sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the exclamation ""yay"" which typically expresses excitement or joy.

step 2: however, several clues indicate this is not the true sentiment:
- jury duty is generally considered an inconvenience by most people.
- the use of the unamused face emoji 😒 directly contradicts the ""yay"".
- the explicit #sarcasm hashtag clearly signals the sarcastic intent.

step 3: the stark contrast between the superficially positive ""yay"" and the negative implications of jury duty, combined with the contradictory emoji and explicit sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicate this statement is sarcastic.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
"i may have played a part, but i wont take sole credit ;) @Hankin57 @Chief1787",0,"i believe i can provide a reliable judgment for this input.

label: not sarcastic

while the text uses a winky face emoji (;)) which can sometimes indicate sarcasm, in this context it appears to be used more playfully or humorously rather than sarcastically. the speaker is acknowledging their contribution to something but modestly downplaying it as not being solely responsible. this seems to be a genuine, lighthearted comment rather than a sarcastic one. the overall tone is friendly and self-effacing, not mocking or critical as sarcasm often is.",0
"@Sharm33n @DJNoreenKhan I thought it was, what I call, the wet look lol",0,"let's approach this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this tweet is subtle and requires some analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""i thought it was"" indicates a casual observation. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end suggests amusement or lightheartedness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be making a humorous observation. the phrase ""what i call, the wet look"" implies that the speaker is creating their own term for whatever appearance they're referring to. this could be a playful or witty way of describing something that looks damp or overly moisturized.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's an element of humor here, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the speaker seems to be genuinely amused by their own observation and is sharing it in a lighthearted way. the ""lol"" reinforces this interpretation. the humor comes from the speaker's casual and perhaps slightly exaggerated description (""the wet look""), but it doesn't contradict or undermine the surface meaning in a way that would indicate sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine, humorous observation rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
A burned tongue is a lovely way to start the day #sarcasm #ouch,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the phrase ""a lovely way to start the day"" is used ironically to describe a burned tongue, which is obviously not a pleasant experience. the use of positive language (""lovely"") to describe a negative situation is a classic sarcastic technique.

additionally, the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic, removing any doubt about the author's intention. the ""#ouch"" hashtag further reinforces that the experience was actually painful, not lovely.

therefore, this tweet is unambiguously sarcastic.",1
Literally functioning on 4 hours of sleep and I feel great 😄 !! #Not #CollegeisKillingMe #OneMoreWeek,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""i feel great"" - a directly positive statement
- ""😄"" - a smiling emoji indicating happiness
- exclamation marks suggesting enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
several clues suggest the true intention is actually negative:
- ""literally functioning on 4 hours of sleep"" - indicates severe sleep deprivation, which is typically not associated with feeling great
- ""#not"" - likely negating the previous positive statement
- ""#collegeiskillingme"" - explicitly negative hashtag suggesting struggle
- ""#onemoreweek"" - implies the speaker is counting down, possibly to the end of a difficult period

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is clearly positive, but the true intention appears to be expressing exhaustion and struggle. the stark contrast between ""feeling great"" and the reality of sleep deprivation and college difficulties, along with the contradictory hashtags, strongly suggest sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the speaker is using sarcasm to highlight the difficulty of their current situation, likely as a coping mechanism or form of humorous complaint.",1
When ya mates dad starts poking you on Facebook #Cringe 😲😬,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems negative or uncomfortable. the use of ""#cringe"" and the emojis 😲😬 (shocked face and grimacing face) suggest discomfort or embarrassment. the phrase ""ya mates dad"" implies an awkward social situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing genuine discomfort or awkwardness about the situation described. the informal language (""ya mates"") and use of social media terminology (""poking you on facebook"") suggest this is a sincere comment about a real, uncomfortable situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the author appears to be genuinely expressing their discomfort about the situation without any apparent irony or sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward expression of embarrassment or discomfort about a real situation, without any indicators of sarcasm or irony.",0
The #irony is anti state ppl will claim the little man (hacker) won when in reality the state won #sony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat negative or critical. key phrases like ""anti state ppl"" and ""little man (hacker)"" suggest a critical tone towards those opposing the state. the use of ""#irony"" also indicates a potential mismatch between appearance and reality.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out a perceived misconception. the author is suggesting that while some people might claim the hacker (""little man"") won against sony, in reality, the state is the true winner. the use of ""#irony"" reinforces that the author sees a contradiction between what people might claim and what they believe is the actual outcome.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a slight mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic in the traditional sense. the author is using ""#irony"" to highlight what they see as a contradictory situation, but they're being relatively straightforward in their communication. they're not saying one thing and meaning the opposite, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet is pointing out an ironic situation, but it's not using sarcasm as a rhetorical device. the author is directly stating their opinion about the misconception they perceive, rather than using sarcasm to convey their message.",0
#HowToGetUnfollowed Post pictures or videos of you smoking. Especially blowing smoke at the camera. #SoCool #Not #GTFO,1,"label: sarcastic

let me explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or instructional, as it's framed as advice on ""how to get unfollowed"" and uses hashtags like ""#socool"".

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually negative and critical. the post is mocking people who share smoking content on social media. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#gtfo"" (get the f*** out) reveal the author's real negative sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (seemingly positive advice) and the true intention (criticism and mockery). the post uses irony to convey its message, presenting an undesirable behavior as if it were desirable, then immediately undercutting it with contradictory hashtags.

this stark contrast between apparent meaning and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm. therefore, this post is clearly sarcastic.",1
These refs are pissing me off. They seriously have no idea of what's going on.,0,"not sarcastic

has anyone visualised the different colours and flavours of twitter streams? kinda lipmus test.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious to me:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the question appears genuine, asking about visualization of twitter streams. the phrase ""kinda lipmus test"" (likely meant to be ""litmus test"") suggests a potentially useful or interesting application.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are a few elements that might suggest sarcasm:
1. the unusual phrasing of ""colours and flavours of twitter streams"" - twitter doesn't literally have flavors.
2. the misspelling of ""lipmus"" instead of ""litmus"" could be intentional to mock the idea.
3. the overall tone seems to be making light of attempts to categorize or analyze twitter content in a simplistic way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be a straightforward question, the odd phrasing and potential mockery of simplistic twitter analysis suggest that this might be a sarcastic comment on overly reductive approaches to understanding social media content.

given this analysis, i'm leaning towards classifying this as sarcastic, though it's a subtle case.

this tweet appears to be a straightforward announcement about a psychic advice radio show. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony present. the message is providing information about the show's schedule, how to call in, and includes a hashtag and link, which are typical elements of promotional social media posts. the tone is informative and direct, without any noticeable contrast between surface sentiment and underlying meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
So ill. It actually hurts to breathe. Still that nice long walk to the station did me the world of good #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet begins by describing feeling very ill, even stating it hurts to breathe. this sets up a negative situation. then it claims a long walk to the station ""did me the world of good,"" which contradicts the initial statement of being extremely unwell. 

the key indicator of sarcasm is the hashtag ""#not"" at the end. this is a common way to explicitly mark sarcasm on social media, indicating that the previous statement (about the walk doing good) should be interpreted as meaning the opposite.

this clear contradiction between the stated illness and the claim of benefit from a long walk, combined with the explicit sarcasm marker ""#not"", makes this a clear case of sarcasm.",1
@DarlaMiles7 then later he snuggles up to The Royals with giddy glee #Irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with phrases like ""snuggles up"" and ""giddy glee"" suggesting warmth and excitement.

step 2: true intention
however, the use of hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet suggests that the author's true intention is to point out a contradiction or hypocrisy. the contrast between ""later"" and the previous action (implied by ""then"") indicates a sudden change in behavior that the author finds noteworthy or amusing.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the positive surface sentiment contrasts sharply with the implied criticism. the author is using seemingly positive language to highlight what they perceive as insincere or contradictory behavior. the explicit use of #irony confirms that the tweet is meant to be understood as the opposite of its literal meaning.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of the #irony hashtag, combined with the contrast between the seemingly positive description and the implied criticism, clearly indicates that this tweet is sarcastic.",1
"Blue skies, warm air, and the royal accommodation! #WhatMoreDoesOneNeed #Education? #Not... http://t.co/mEtHUIaAtR http://t.co/CsW0rfhGZZ",1,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and luxurious. keywords like ""blue skies,"" ""warm air,"" and ""royal accommodation"" suggest a pleasant, high-class experience. the hashtag ""#whatmoredoesoneneed"" reinforces this positive sentiment.

step 2: true intention
however, the additional hashtags ""#education?"" and ""#not..."" suggest a contrasting message. these hashtags imply that education is what's actually needed, not the luxurious conditions described. the ellipsis after ""not"" further emphasizes this contrast.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the juxtaposition between the seemingly positive description of comfortable conditions and the implied importance of education reveals a sarcastic tone. the author is likely criticizing a situation where luxury is prioritized over education, using the initial positive description to set up the sarcastic twist.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses a classic sarcastic structure of presenting something seemingly positive, then undercutting it with contrasting implications. the sarcasm lies in the implied criticism of prioritizing comfort over education.",1
it's International Human Rights Day #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. ""international human rights day"" is typically seen as a positive observance. there are no overtly negative words or phrases. the hashtag ""#irony"" is the only element that suggests potential sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the inclusion of ""#irony"" is crucial here. by explicitly labeling the statement as ironic, the author is signaling that their true intention is the opposite of the surface meaning. this suggests that the author believes there's a contradiction between the ideal of human rights and the reality of how they're observed (or violated) internationally.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface text mentions a day dedicated to human rights, the ""#irony"" tag transforms the meaning entirely. it implies that the author finds the concept of ""international human rights day"" to be contradictory or hypocritical in some way, perhaps due to ongoing human rights violations globally.

given this analysis, the true intention is to criticize or mock the concept of international human rights day, using sarcasm as the vehicle for this criticism.

### label: sarcastic",1
So Jeremy Irons and Alan Rickman are BOTH in Marrakech just one week before I'm going there #everythingisfine #not #sonot,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or excited. the author mentions two famous actors (jeremy irons and alan rickman) being in marrakech just before their own trip there. the hashtag ""#everythingisfine"" also seems positive on the surface.

step 2: true intention
however, there are clear indicators that the true intention is actually frustration or disappointment:
1. the use of all caps for ""both"" emphasizes the unlikelihood of this coincidence.
2. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#sonot"" directly contradict the ""#everythingisfine"" hashtag, indicating that things are actually not fine.
3. the timing (""just one week before i'm going there"") suggests the author is upset about missing the chance to see these actors.

step 3: analysis and inference
the contrast between the seemingly positive surface statement and the clearly negative true intention, especially with the use of contradictory hashtags, is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the author is using irony to express their disappointment at missing out on seeing these famous actors by just a week.

### label: sarcastic",1
@TheLuluLife I take it you're not in England then ; ),0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the use of a winking face emoticon ""; )"" suggests a friendly or playful tone. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a light-hearted, joking comment about the weather or conditions in england. the phrase ""i take it you're not in england then"" implies that the conditions wherever @thelululife is are different (likely better) than those in england. the winking emoticon reinforces this playful implication.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a slight discrepancy between the neutral surface statement and the implied meaning, this doesn't appear to reach the level of sarcasm. the comment is more of a gentle tease or joke about england's reputation for poor weather or conditions, rather than a sarcastic statement.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement uses mild humor and implication, but it doesn't have the hallmarks of sarcasm such as saying the opposite of what is meant or using exaggerated praise to criticize. it's more of a friendly, teasing comment.",0

@houselanguage Thanks for pirating my music! :D #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""thanks for..."" which typically expresses gratitude
- the smiley face emoticon "":d"" indicating happiness or excitement

step 2: true intention
however, several clues suggest the true intention is negative:
- ""pirating my music"" refers to illegal downloading, which is harmful to artists
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to indicate the opposite of what was just said
- the use of an exclamation mark adds emphasis, potentially to the sarcastic tone

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positivity clashes strongly with the negative implications of music piracy and the explicit ""#not"" tag. this stark contrast between the apparently grateful tone and the actual harmful action being described is a classic sarcastic structure.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is clearly using sarcasm to criticize the act of pirating music while feigning gratitude on the surface.",1
Welcome to the surrealist estate agency!! http://t.co/IcLOrQ0P8d,0,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, but let me explain my reasoning:

the phrase ""surrealist estate agency"" is an oxymoron that immediately signals sarcasm. real estate agencies typically deal with practical, tangible properties, while surrealism is an artistic movement focused on illogical, dream-like scenarios. 

by combining these contradictory concepts, the tweet creates a humorous and absurd image, likely poking fun at unusual or unrealistic property listings or marketing tactics in the real estate industry.

the exclamation marks and the inclusion of a link further reinforce the sarcastic tone, inviting readers to view something presumably ridiculous or exaggerated.

therefore, this tweet is clearly employing sarcasm to make a point about the real estate market or a particular property listing, rather than genuinely advertising a surrealist estate agency.",1

"BM ""gives me"" from 3 pm to 8 pm with my son today, that's fair huh? #NOT!",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet appears to be criticizing an unfair custody arrangement. the use of quotation marks around ""gives me"" suggests skepticism about the fairness of the arrangement. the phrase ""that's fair huh?"" is clearly meant ironically, especially when followed by ""#not!"" which is a common way to explicitly mark sarcasm.

the contrast between the surface sentiment (seemingly agreeing it's fair) and the true intention (expressing frustration at an unfair situation) is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the hashtag ""#not!"" removes any doubt, serving as an explicit sarcasm marker.",1
@Mr_laddu and if Marathi man speak hindi to Chu*** samajhte hai #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the content requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is negative and confrontational. the use of ""chu***"" (likely a censored insult) and ""#irony"" suggests frustration or criticism. the tweet appears to be commenting on language dynamics between hindi and marathi speakers.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing a perceived attitude where hindi speakers may look down on or misunderstand marathi speakers who attempt to speak hindi. the ""#irony"" hashtag is key here, indicating that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is negative, the use of ""#irony"" transforms the meaning. the author is likely using sarcasm to highlight and criticize a social or linguistic issue. the irony lies in the implied absurdity of judging someone negatively for attempting to communicate in a non-native language.

based on this analysis, particularly the use of ""#irony"" and the contrast between the surface statement and the implied criticism, i can conclude:

Lesson learnt? Herd of sheep who fought over TVs on #BlackFriday struggling to sell them http://t.co/OMXl5ZPOdY #irony #capitalism,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or critical. key phrases like ""lesson learnt?"" and ""struggling to sell them"" suggest a critical tone. the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#capitalism"" also hint at a critique of consumerist behavior.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing the behavior of people who frantically bought tvs during black friday sales. the author is drawing a parallel between these shoppers and a ""herd of sheep,"" implying mindless group behavior. the irony lies in the fact that after fighting to buy these tvs, they're now having trouble selling them, suggesting the purchases were unnecessary or ill-considered.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention, but the way it's expressed is clearly sarcastic. the use of the sheep metaphor, the rhetorical question ""lesson learnt?"", and the explicit hashtag ""#irony"" all point to a sarcastic tone. the author is using irony to make a point about consumerism and the futility of black friday shopping frenzies.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is clearly using sarcasm to criticize consumer behavior during black friday sales.",1
Tomorrow three test signature.|Thank you. |#school #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification based on the following analysis:

1. the text mentions ""three test signature"" which seems like a neutral or potentially stressful situation for a student.

2. the phrase ""thank you"" is used, which on the surface appears positive.

3. most importantly, the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly included at the end of the text.

the inclusion of the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic. this directly contradicts the seemingly sincere ""thank you,"" revealing the sarcastic nature of the entire statement.

the author is likely expressing frustration or annoyance at having three tests scheduled for tomorrow, and the ""thank you"" is meant to be read sarcastically rather than genuinely.

given these factors, especially the explicit sarcasm tag, i'm highly confident in classifying this text as ""sarcastic.""",1
"So #GuardiansOfPeace win by threatening to destroy the #peace!!!, what a #irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or celebratory due to:
- use of ""win"" 
- exclamation marks for emphasis
- hashtag ""#peace""

however, there's also a contradictory element with ""threatening to destroy"" which creates tension in the message.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, we can see:
- the phrase ""guardians of peace"" is put in quotes, suggesting skepticism
- there's an obvious contradiction between ""peace"" and ""threatening to destroy""
- the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end explicitly points out the ironic nature of the situation

the true intention appears to be criticizing or mocking the idea that threatening violence could be considered ""winning"" or promoting peace.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface positive sentiment clashes strongly with the underlying critical message. the use of irony is explicitly called out, and the statement is constructed to highlight the absurdity of the situation.

given these factors, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is clearly using sarcasm to criticize the contradiction in the actions of the ""guardians of peace"".",1

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to phrases like ""worst #customerservice i have ever had"" and hashtags like ""#notworthit"". the overall tone seems critical and dissatisfied.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing genuine frustration and disappointment with a company's customer service. the use of hashtags like ""#not #responsible"" and ""#notworthit"" appears to be directly criticizing the company rather than using irony. the mention of not even offering ""$10 #discounts"" further emphasizes the perceived poor value.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the tone is strongly negative, there doesn't appear to be a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the criticism seems straightforward and sincere rather than employing sarcasm to make a point. the hashtags and phrasing are being used for emphasis rather than irony.

Thanks GORI-san|#djgori #not for sale http://t.co/g09TZY3oHO,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of gratitude without any evident sarcastic elements. the user is thanking someone named gori-san, likely referencing a dj (given the hashtag #djgori), and including a link to what seems to be an image or product that is ""not for sale."" there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony in this short message.",0
We may be some time. #Hibernot #Not http://t.co/n5z2IXabq9,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet doesn't appear to contain any sarcastic elements. it's a straightforward statement, likely referring to an outdoor activity or adventure, as suggested by the hashtag ""#hibernot"" (which seems to be a play on ""hibernate"" and ""not""). the phrase ""we may be some time"" is a casual way of saying they might be gone for a while, which fits with the idea of an outdoor excursion. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/n5z2ixabq9) suggests it might be accompanied by a photo or more information about the activity. without any contradictory or ironic elements, this tweet appears to be a sincere statement about an upcoming or ongoing outdoor experience.",0

@TorontoStar: NDP to introduce bill to make OHIP public #not appropriate # confidentiality,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the sarcasm in this tweet isn't immediately obvious.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly negative. the tweet reports on a potential bill by the ndp party, but includes hashtags ""#not appropriate"" and ""#confidentiality"", which suggest disapproval or concern.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet is likely to criticize or mock the ndp's proposed bill. the key point here is that ohip (ontario health insurance plan) is already a public healthcare system. proposing to ""make ohip public"" doesn't make sense, as it's already public. this suggests the tweet is pointing out an absurdity or mistake in the ndp's proposal.

step 3: analysis and inference
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see a disconnect. the tweet presents what seems like a straightforward news item, but the content itself is nonsensical (proposing to make something public that is already public). the hashtags further emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation. this mismatch between the seemingly serious tone and the absurd content is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is using sarcasm to mock or criticize the ndp's understanding of ohip or their policy proposals.",1

Yay yet another week with a child home from school ill! Just a hint of #Sarcasm to brighten my day.,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to words like ""yay"" and ""brighten my day.""

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly negative. having a sick child at home is typically stressful and inconvenient. the phrase ""yet another week"" implies this is a recurring, frustrating situation. the author explicitly mentions ""#sarcasm,"" directly indicating their sarcastic intent.

step 3: the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the actually negative situation, combined with the explicit sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic statement.

therefore, the correct label is ""sarcastic.""",1
"#SMILES when there is #MONEY|#SCOWLS when there is #NOT|#RECOGNITION when there is #MONEY|#IGNORANCE when there is #NOT|⛪🏦?🏥💰🚓👊💥|""'💔#GOD$💔""",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the input is quite cryptic and requires careful analysis.

step 1: surface sentiment
the text uses hashtags and emojis to convey various emotions and concepts:
- smiles and money are associated with positive sentiment
- scowls and not suggest negative sentiment
- recognition is generally positive
- ignorance is negative
- emojis include both positive (church, bank, hospital) and negative (police, fist, collision) symbols
- the broken heart emoji and mention of god suggests sadness or distress

the surface sentiment is mixed, with both positive and negative elements.

step 2: true intention
the structure of the text suggests a pattern of contrasts:
- smiles with money, scowls without
- recognition with money, ignorance without
this implies a critique of how money influences behavior and perception.

the string of emojis seems to represent societal institutions (church, bank, hospital) followed by money and conflict symbols, potentially suggesting corruption or violence related to money.

the final line with broken hearts around ""god"" and a dollar sign implies a cynical view of the relationship between religion and money.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface uses some positive terms, the overall structure and implications are deeply cynical. the text appears to be a biting commentary on the influence of money in various aspects of society, including personal behavior, social recognition, institutions, and even religion.

the contrast between surface positivity (smiles, recognition) and the underlying critique of money's corrupting influence strongly suggests sarcasm.

@AntearousGaming hey I seen u have followed me and I was going to ask to check out my channel and help me with a shoutout for subscribers ??,0,"not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but i'll break it down to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment is neutral to positive. the user is making a polite request for help and a shoutout. there are no overtly sarcastic keywords or phrases, and the tone is straightforward and hopeful.

step 2: the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. this seems to be a genuine request from a smaller content creator asking for support from a more established one. the language is direct and lacks any subtle cues that might indicate sarcasm or irony.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the message is a straightforward, earnest request for help in growing a youtube channel. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.

therefore, i can confidently label this as ""not sarcastic"". the message appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic request for assistance in growing a youtube channel.",0

Gotta love being lied to.... #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet ""gotta love being lied to.... #not"" is clearly sarcastic. the surface sentiment of ""gotta love"" suggests a positive feeling, but this is immediately contradicted by the negative experience of ""being lied to"". the use of ""..."" indicates a pause for effect, emphasizing the contradiction.

most importantly, the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common indicator of sarcasm, explicitly signaling that the preceding statement should be interpreted as meaning the opposite of what it literally says.

the writer is expressing frustration or disappointment about being lied to, using sarcasm to convey their true negative feelings about the situation.",1
@JustQueenVee @deray Ladies wouldn't use that language.But I guess you are not one.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the statement ""ladies wouldn't use that language"" suggests disapproval of someone's language use. the follow-up ""but i guess you are not one"" implies an insult, suggesting the person is not a lady.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker appears to be genuinely criticizing the language used by @justqueenvee, implying that it's unladylike. the statement ""but i guess you are not one"" is a direct insult, questioning the femininity or ladylike qualities of the person being addressed.

step 3: compare and analyze
in this case, the surface sentiment and true intention align. the speaker is being openly critical and insulting, without any apparent irony or contradiction that would indicate sarcasm. the statement is meant to be taken at face value as a direct criticism and insult.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement, while rude and insulting, does not appear to employ sarcasm. it's a straightforward, if impolite, expression of disapproval and criticism.",0
@RosieMorse I hate you lol,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the phrase ""i hate you"". however, this is immediately followed by ""lol"" (laugh out loud), which introduces a conflicting positive or playful tone.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""lol"" after a strong negative statement like ""i hate you"" typically indicates that the speaker doesn't actually mean what they're saying. ""lol"" is often used to soften a statement or indicate that it's not meant to be taken seriously. in this context, it's likely that the speaker is actually expressing affection or friendly teasing rather than genuine hatred.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (hatred) is contradicted by the addition of ""lol"", which changes the entire meaning of the statement. this contradiction between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the speaker is using an exaggerated negative statement (""i hate you"") to express what is likely the opposite sentiment, made clear by the addition of ""lol"".

### label: sarcastic

the contrast between the literal statement and the implied meaning, along with the use of ""lol"" to signal non-seriousness, strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic statement.",1
I didn't know it's your territory I really. .. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN- no. . Please don't shoot at me I. .,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of fear, confusion, and pleading. key phrases like ""please don't shoot at me"" and the fragmented speech pattern (""i didn't know... i really... what are you doin-"") suggest genuine alarm and distress.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. this appears to be a person who has accidentally entered someone else's ""territory"" and is now fearfully reacting to a threatening situation. the broken speech and capitalization of ""what are you doin-"" further reinforce the impression of genuine panic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the text reads as a sincere expression of fear and confusion in a potentially dangerous situation. there are no obvious indicators of irony or sarcasm such as exaggeration, mockery, or contrasting tones.

### label: not sarcastic

this text appears to be a genuine expression of alarm and is not sarcastic.",0

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to break it down step-by-step. the text appears to be a straightforward description of a shopping trip with a teenager. the author is describing the items purchased and their resulting state (tired and broke), which is a common and genuine sentiment after a day of shopping. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony in the text.",0

Hyper at 1AM when I really should be getting rest #ohwhale 🐋🐳,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed:
- ""hyper at 1am"" suggests excitement or energy
- ""really should be getting rest"" indicates awareness of a need for sleep
- ""#ohwhale"" and whale emojis 🐋🐳 seem lighthearted or dismissive

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or resignation about being unable to sleep when one should. the ""#ohwhale"" (likely meant to be ""oh well"") and whale emojis are used ironically to downplay the situation, despite the person likely being annoyed by it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface excitement of being ""hyper"" contrasts with the underlying frustration of not being able to sleep. the casual ""#ohwhale"" and emojis are used to sarcastically brush off what is likely a genuinely bothersome situation. this mismatch between the surface tone and the true feelings indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the use of irony to comment on the frustration of insomnia, coupled with the deliberately misspelled and seemingly carefree hashtag, strongly suggests a sarcastic tone.",1
"We were miles apart,but you found me, now we are close enough, still apart #irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and romantic. key phrases like ""you found me"" and ""we are close enough"" suggest a heartwarming story of connection. the use of ""miles apart"" contrasted with ""close enough"" implies a journey of coming together.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are contradictory elements that suggest irony:
1. ""miles apart"" vs. ""close enough"" - this juxtaposition hints at an unresolved tension.
2. ""close enough, still apart"" - this phrase directly contradicts itself, indicating irony.
3. the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the statement is not to be taken at face value.

step 3: analysis and inference
the surface sentiment presents a seemingly positive story of connection, but the true intention appears to be highlighting the irony of a situation where people can be metaphorically close yet still physically or emotionally distant. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms that the statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of contradictory elements and the explicit use of ""#irony"" make it clear that this statement is intended to be sarcastic, despite its initially positive appearance.",1
Drinking a Southern Triangle IPA by @RoughDraftBrew at @yardhouse -- http://t.co/G2sIEm7ZSV,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward statement about drinking a specific beer at a particular location. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the user is simply sharing what they're doing, which is common on social media platforms like twitter. the mention of the specific beer brand, brewery, and location, along with the inclusion of a link (likely to a photo or check-in), suggests this is a genuine, non-sarcastic post about the user's current activity.",0
"American Red Cross van ""together we can save lives..."" And the driver is smoking. #irony",1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the irony (which the user explicitly points out with ""#irony"") lies in the contrast between the red cross van's message about saving lives and the driver's unhealthy, life-threatening behavior of smoking. this juxtaposition creates a sarcastic commentary on the inconsistency between the organization's mission and the individual's actions.",1
@TheBravesAddict @Braves It also makes me want to post this... http://t.co/CGE2VlixTY,0,"to determine if this tweet is sarcastic or not, i'll need to analyze it step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""it also makes me want to"" suggests a positive inclination towards something. there are no overtly negative or positive keywords or emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is unclear without more context. the tweet refers to wanting to post something, and includes a link. without knowing what the link leads to or understanding the full conversation context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the neutral-to-positive tone, there isn't enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the tweet appears to be a straightforward statement about wanting to share something in response to a previous interaction.

### label: not sarcastic

while i can't be 100% certain without more context, the lack of clear sarcastic markers and the straightforward nature of the tweet lead me to classify it as not sarcastic.",0
#birthcontrol #lol #wtf #whatisbirthcontrol @planb great commercial #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this assessment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment is mixed. there are hashtags like ""#lol"" and ""#wtf"" which could indicate amusement or confusion. the phrase ""great commercial"" seems positive on the surface.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we look at the context and other elements:
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the message is meant to be taken sarcastically.
- ""#wtf"" and ""#whatisbirthcontrol"" suggest confusion or criticism rather than genuine praise.
- the juxtaposition of ""great commercial"" with these other elements implies that the speaker doesn't actually think the commercial is great.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it's clear that this is a sarcastic message. the seemingly positive ""great commercial"" is undermined by the surrounding context and the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"".

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic"".",1
Oh how I love working in Baltimore #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""oh how i love working in baltimore"", which expresses affection for working in the city.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed by the hashtag ""#not"" at the end. in internet slang, adding ""#not"" after a statement indicates that the opposite of what was just said is actually meant.

step 3: the contrast between the seemingly positive statement and the negating hashtag is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is using verbal irony to express their actual dislike of working in baltimore by stating the opposite and then immediately contradicting it.

therefore, this tweet is clearly sarcastic.",1

So I'm the school nurse today. And I have a fever. #irony,1,"label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the speaker states they are the school nurse for the day, which could be seen as a responsibility or opportunity. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the second sentence: ""and i have a fever."" this reveals an ironic situation where the person responsible for health care is themselves ill. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end explicitly points out this contradiction.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the juxtaposition of being the school nurse (someone expected to care for sick students) while being sick themselves creates a clear ironic situation. the author is highlighting this irony through the structure of their statement and the use of the irony hashtag. this deliberate pointing out of a contradictory or absurd situation is a hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, despite the neutral surface sentiment, the underlying irony and explicit labeling of the situation as ironic indicate that this statement is indeed sarcastic.",1

this tweet appears to be a straightforward news headline sharing information about jeb bush considering a presidential run. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in the text. it's a factual statement using hashtags to highlight key terms, which is common practice for sharing news on social media platforms like twitter. the included link also suggests it's directing to a legitimate news article. therefore, this tweet can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0
"Thanks for the dick pic, really, thanks. #Sarcasm",1,"label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- use of ""thanks"" twice
- the word ""really"" emphasizing the gratitude

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly negative and disapproving:
- sending unsolicited explicit pictures is generally considered inappropriate and offensive
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates the statement is not meant to be taken at face value

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the superficially thankful tone and the implied disapproval, combined with the explicit sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic statement.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
@Margoandhow @imalexbeamyrnot spawn of Larry Ellison aka World's Worst Human,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident this tweet is not sarcastic, but i'll walk through my thought process to explain why:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is quite negative, with phrases like ""spawn of larry ellison"" and ""world's worst human"" expressing strong disapproval.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. the user seems to be genuinely criticizing larry ellison and possibly someone associated with him (perhaps his child or a close associate).

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's no apparent mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the language is direct and harsh, but it doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or fake positivity. the criticism seems sincere rather than sarcastic.

given this analysis, i can confidently say this tweet is not sarcastic. it's a straightforward, albeit harsh, expression of negative sentiment towards larry ellison and someone associated with him.",0
Really loves dentist appointments. #sarcasm,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

1. the surface sentiment appears positive with ""really loves dentist appointments"", which expresses strong affection for dental visits.

2. however, it's extremely rare for people to genuinely love dentist appointments. they are typically associated with discomfort or anxiety.

3. the clincher is the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end, which directly indicates the sarcastic intent of the statement.

the contrast between the seemingly positive statement and the common negative perception of dentist visits, coupled with the explicit sarcasm tag, makes this a clear case of sarcasm.",1

i believe this judgment is reliable, so i'm outputting the result directly. the text appears to be a straightforward discussion about player retention in sports, likely basketball. the author is expressing their honest opinion about retaining a player at maximum salary and hoping that certain factors might lower the player's market value, which they admit is a selfish perspective. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meanings in this text. the language is direct and the sentiment matches the intended meaning.",0
@Adsy_1 You're a tough bugger ;p,0,"not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the text ""@adsy_1 you're a tough bugger ;p"" appears to be a friendly, playful comment rather than sarcastic. the use of the winking tongue-out emoticon "";p"" indicates a lighthearted tone, and calling someone a ""tough bugger"" in this context seems to be a casual compliment on their resilience or strength. there are no indicators of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
I'm shocked that Mark May doesn't think the Buckeyes should be in the playoff!!! #Sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be one of genuine shock and surprise. the use of ""i'm shocked"" and the exclamation marks suggest strong emotion.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed by several factors:
1. the use of excessive exclamation marks (!!!) often indicates exaggeration or insincerity.
2. the explicit hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end clearly indicates that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.
3. the context suggests that mark may (likely a sports commentator) frequently criticizes the buckeyes, so his negative opinion would not be surprising.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment of shock with the clear sarcastic markers, especially the explicit #sarcasm hashtag, it's evident that this statement is intentionally sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the predictability of mark may's opinion.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic.""",1
"Google scholarship application kept crashing in Chrome. Opened it in IE, finished application without incident. #irony",1,"label: sarcastic

i believe this tweet is clearly sarcastic, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the user reports an issue with chrome but successfully completes their task using internet explorer (ie). the hashtag #irony is used at the end.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to highlight the irony of the situation. google, known for its chrome browser, has an application that doesn't work properly in chrome but functions well in internet explorer, a competitor's browser often criticized for being outdated or less efficient.

step 3: analysis and final label
the use of ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the user finds this situation ironic and is pointing it out sarcastically. the irony lies in the fact that a google application works better in a competitor's browser than in google's own browser. this contradiction between expectation (google products should work best in chrome) and reality (it worked better in ie) is the essence of the sarcasm here.

therefore, the tweet is clearly sarcastic, using irony to comment on the unexpected situation of a google product functioning better in a competitor's browser.",1

Set my alarm for PM not AM...guess you could say I've got my life together #not sorry @PE_Tweetcher #Pearlburg mom and Jesus,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or neutral. the person is talking about setting an alarm, which is a normal activity. the phrase ""i've got my life together"" typically indicates a positive sentiment about one's organization and responsibility.

step 2: true intention
however, there are several clues that suggest the true intention is different:
1. the hashtag ""#not"" immediately follows the positive statement, which is a common way to negate the previous statement sarcastically.
2. the phrase ""guess you could say"" often introduces a sarcastic or ironic statement.
3. setting the alarm for pm instead of am implies a mistake or poor planning, which contradicts having one's life together.
4. the hashtag ""#pearlburg mom and jesus"" seems out of place and may be used ironically.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of having one's life together is directly contradicted by the mistake with the alarm and the use of ""#not"". the overall tone and structure of the tweet, particularly the use of hashtags and the contradictory elements, strongly suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic about their level of organization and responsibility.

given this analysis, i can confidently say:

"Gun nut yells at cops conducting DUI checkpoint, later hit by drunk driver on way home #irony #karma http://t.co/3EAMnVETe1",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or critical. key phrases like ""gun nut yells at cops"" and ""hit by drunk driver"" suggest a negative event. the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#karma"" also indicate a critical or judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet is to point out the ironic and karmic nature of the situation. the person who was loudly criticizing a dui checkpoint (implying they were against it) ended up being hit by a drunk driver themselves. the author is using this situation to highlight the irony and suggest that the ""gun nut"" got what they deserved (karma).

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment is negative, but the true intention is to highlight irony and express a sense of poetic justice. the use of hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#karma"" are clear indicators of sarcastic intent. the author is not simply reporting news, but rather pointing out the ironic turn of events in a way that's meant to be humorous or satisfying to the audience.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

"Have you ever seen the like??

step 2: the true intention of this tweet seems to be mocking or criticizing the situation. the use of exaggerated language (""rob the royal family"") and the juxtaposition of this with ""kate's 32k meal"" implies that the author finds the situation ridiculous or hypocritical. the hashtag #irony confirms that the author is not being literal.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, it's clear that the surface outrage is not genuine, but rather a rhetorical device to highlight the perceived absurdity of the situation. the explicit use of #irony, combined with the exaggerated language and the contrast between ""robbing"" and an expensive meal, strongly indicates that this tweet is sarcastic.

It's snowing in Chicago #whitechristmas #not,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. ""it's snowing in chicago"" is a neutral statement, but the hashtag ""#whitechristmas"" suggests a positive sentiment associated with the idyllic image of snow during christmas time.

step 2: true intention
however, the final hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator that the true intention is the opposite of what's being stated. in internet and social media language, adding ""not"" at the end of a statement is a common way to express sarcasm or indicate that the opposite is true.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment seems positive or neutral, but the ""#not"" at the end completely reverses the meaning. this stark contrast between the apparent meaning and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""#not"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm in this context, effectively negating the apparent meaning of the rest of the message.",1
Oh I just love when I wake up with a migraine 😒 #not #needmeds,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- use of the word ""love""
- the phrase ""i just love when..."" typically indicates enthusiasm

however, there are conflicting elements:
- use of the rolling eyes emoji 😒
- hashtags ""#not"" and ""#needmeds""
- mentioning a migraine, which is generally unpleasant

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears negative:
- waking up with a migraine is universally considered unpleasant
- the rolling eyes emoji 😒 indicates frustration or annoyance
- ""#not"" directly contradicts the positive statement
- ""#needmeds"" implies discomfort and need for relief

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""love"") sharply contrasts with the true negative intention. the use of positive language to describe a clearly negative experience, coupled with contradictory hashtags and emoji, is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses irony to express frustration about waking up with a migraine, making it definitively sarcastic.",1
"Oh Oh mum is #not #going to be #pleased #littletike http://t.co/5Q01FsYjCW""",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative or concerned. key phrases like ""oh oh"" and ""mum is #not #going to be #pleased"" suggest worry or anticipation of displeasure. the hashtag ""#littletike"" implies a child might be involved, potentially causing the displeasure.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the tweet appears to be genuinely expressing concern or anticipation of a parent's displeasure, likely due to something a child has done. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/5q01fsyjcw) suggests there might be an image or more context provided, probably showing what the child did.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the tweet seems to be a straightforward expression of anticipating a negative reaction from a parent. there are no clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or other hallmarks of sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of concern or anticipation of a negative reaction, without any evident sarcastic elements.",0
Its a shame on an off day that the NFL doesnt have any interesting stories and isnt getting any attention. NOT #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""it's a shame"" suggests disappointment, and ""isn't getting any attention"" implies a lack of interest.

step 2: however, the true intention is the opposite. the use of ""not #sarcasm"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this phrase is often used to emphasize that the preceding statement is, in fact, sarcastic. additionally, the nfl typically has many interesting stories and attracts a lot of attention, even on off days.

step 3: comparing the surface negative sentiment with the actual positive reality (the nfl likely does have interesting stories and attention), along with the explicit sarcasm marker ""not #sarcasm"", we can confidently conclude that this statement is sarcastic.

therefore, the final label is: sarcastic.",1
Felicitats http://t.co/SnKpTNHwJ7 #Penedesfera #notcies,0,"not sarcastic

Cook and England rudderless at the death. Seven games and we've got progressively worse! Can't wait 'till they arrive here for WC #sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""can't wait"" is used sarcastically to express the opposite - that the speaker is not looking forward to the event at all.

2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic.

3. the overall context is negative (team getting ""progressively worse""), contrasting with the seemingly positive ""can't wait"" statement.

these elements, especially the explicit sarcasm hashtag, make it clear that this tweet is meant to be read as sarcastic criticism of the england cricket team's performance and prospects for the world cup.",1

@restlessduncan @SR_Duncan At least you got my joke,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'm confident in this assessment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

this tweet appears to be a straightforward response to someone acknowledging that they understood a joke. the phrase ""at least you got my joke"" is not inherently sarcastic. it's a common expression used to express genuine relief or appreciation when someone understands humor that others might have missed.

the context suggests that @restlessduncan made a joke earlier, and @sr_duncan understood it. the speaker is simply expressing satisfaction that at least one person (the addressee) understood their humor.

there are no obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, contradiction, or irony. the tone seems sincere and the statement aligns with its literal meaning. therefore, i classify this as not sarcastic.",0
"@valb00: It's 2015. Why am I still manually turning on/off WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, etc..? #fb yep",0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be one of frustration or complaint. the user is questioning why they still have to manually control various wireless technologies in 2015, implying this should be automated by now.

step 2: upon closer examination, this tweet is likely expressing genuine frustration rather than sarcasm. the user seems to be sincerely questioning why technology hasn't advanced to automatically manage these settings. the hashtag ""#fb"" typically means the tweet is being cross-posted to facebook, and the final ""yep"" appears to be an affirmation of the sentiment.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the user appears to be expressing a genuine complaint about technology not being as advanced or convenient as they'd like. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the language used.

"Is there a ""like"" tab on me? I'm not a facebook status to be liked by people... #sarcasm #RudeButTrue",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification for the following reasons:

1. the text explicitly includes the hashtag #sarcasm, which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

2. the content of the message uses an ironic comparison between a person and a facebook status, highlighting the absurdity of expecting people to be ""liked"" in the same way as social media posts.

3. the tone is deliberately exaggerated and critical, which is characteristic of sarcastic statements.

4. the additional hashtag #rudebuttrue further reinforces the sarcastic intent, implying that while the statement may seem rude, it's meant to convey a truth in a humorous or biting way.

given these clear indicators, particularly the explicit use of #sarcasm, i can confidently classify this text as sarcastic without needing to go through the step-by-step analysis.",1

#Johnny #Football #time #is #not #a #fun time #any #more: The Cleveland Browns went into Sunday's game against the... http://t.co/Vm4E3dKexF,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative. key phrases like ""not a fun time any more"" suggest disappointment or frustration. the hashtag style and reference to ""#johnny #football"" (likely johnny manziel) implies this is about sports, specifically the cleveland browns' performance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. it's expressing genuine disappointment about johnny manziel's (nicknamed johnny football) performance with the cleveland browns. the phrase ""not a fun time any more"" suggests things were once exciting but have declined, which is likely a straightforward expression of fan frustration.

step 3: analysis and inference
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the tweet seems to be a straightforward expression of disappointment without any apparent irony or sarcasm. the style is direct and doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or mock enthusiasm.

### label: not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of disappointment about the cleveland browns and johnny manziel's performance, without sarcastic undertones.",0

08:01am on the dot and the buzzer rings #helloworld #not #sleepy #tired #nothanks,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. key phrases:
- ""08:01am on the dot"" - neutral, factual
- ""#helloworld"" - generally positive greeting
- ""#not"" - potentially negative
- ""#sleepy #tired"" - negative feelings
- ""#nothanks"" - negative, rejection

the mix of positive and negative hashtags creates an ambiguous surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or annoyance at having to wake up early. the precise time ""08:01am on the dot"" suggests an unwelcome alarm or schedule. the contrasting hashtags ""#helloworld"" (typically positive) with ""#not #sleepy #tired #nothanks"" (negative) imply the opposite of what's being said.

step 3: compare and analyze
the contrast between the seemingly cheerful ""#helloworld"" and the reality of feeling tired and unwilling to start the day indicates sarcasm. the use of ""#not"" further reinforces this interpretation, as it's often used to negate the previous statement in a sarcastic manner.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the use of contrasting hashtags and the implied frustration with early rising strongly suggest a sarcastic tone.",1
"@Naaaauds Now I have a game Monday, Tuesday, friday and Saturday 😭😭",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or frustrated. this is indicated by:
- the use of crying face emojis (😭😭) at the end of the sentence
- the listing of multiple game days, implying a busy and potentially overwhelming schedule

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the user appears to be genuinely expressing frustration or exhaustion about their busy game schedule. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, irony, or any attempt at humor. the tone seems straightforward and sincere.

step 3: compare and analyze
when comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the user is directly communicating their feelings about their packed schedule. the crying emojis reinforce the sentiment rather than contradict it, which would be more typical in sarcastic statements.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of frustration or overwhelm about a busy sports schedule, without any indicators of sarcasm.",0
@FireInTheLyons Go you! #not Home until the 1st Jan. So excited!,0,"since i'm not entirely confident in making an immediate judgment, i'll analyze this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""go you!"" which is an encouraging phrase
- ""so excited!"" expressing enthusiasm
- the use of an exclamation mark reinforcing the positive emotion

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection:
- ""#not"" is included, which is often used to indicate sarcasm or the opposite of what's being said
- being away from home until january 1st (potentially for work or other obligations) is not typically something people are genuinely excited about, especially during the holiday season

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface-level positive sentiment contradicts the likely true feelings of the speaker. the inclusion of ""#not"" is a clear indicator that the excitement expressed is not genuine. the author is using sarcasm to express their true feelings about not being home, likely frustration or disappointment.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of ""#not"" and the context of being away from home (presumably during a time when most people want to be home) strongly suggests this is a sarcastic statement.",1

@SR_Duncan Three minutes is better than no minutes,0,"### label: not sarcastic

while this statement could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic in certain contexts, i believe it's more likely to be a genuine, non-sarcastic comment. here's my reasoning:

1. the statement ""three minutes is better than no minutes"" is a straightforward expression of the idea that having a small amount of something is preferable to having none at all.

2. this type of statement is commonly used to express optimism or to find a silver lining in a less-than-ideal situation. it's often used genuinely to encourage people to make the most of limited time or resources.

3. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggerated language, obvious contradictions, or contextual clues that would suggest the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.

4. the tweet seems to be a response to another user (@sr_duncan), which suggests it might be part of a conversation where the context supports a literal interpretation.

without more context about the conversation or the typical communication style of the users involved, it's most reasonable to interpret this statement at face value. therefore, i classify it as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"Found my motivation... Aka the back of my eye lids, by accident. Boy, me and @Kels_efollin are some winners. #not #senioritisisreal #losers",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first with phrases like ""found my motivation"" and calling themselves ""winners."" however, there are clear negative indicators with hashtags like ""#not"" and ""#losers.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention is self-deprecating humor. the author is sarcastically calling themselves and their friend ""winners"" while actually implying they are lazy or unmotivated (finding motivation in sleep).

step 3: analysis
the contrast between the initial positive statement and the contradictory hashtags, along with the exaggerated praise (""some winners"") followed by ""#losers,"" clearly indicates sarcasm. the use of ""aka the back of my eye lids"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone, implying they're sleeping instead of being productive.

the hashtag ""#not"" is a very strong indicator of sarcasm, directly negating the preceding statement. ""#senioritisisreal"" also suggests a humorous take on their lack of motivation.

given these factors, this tweet is clearly sarcastic in nature.",1
The ones that caught me by surprise were the ones I didn't expect #duh #redundantredundant,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""caught me by surprise"" typically indicates a sense of wonder or unexpected pleasure. the hashtags #duh and #redundantredundant don't convey a clear sentiment on their own.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we look at the full context:
- ""the ones that caught me by surprise were the ones i didn't expect"" is a tautological statement. by definition, something surprising is unexpected.
- the hashtag #duh emphasizes that this is an obvious statement.
- #redundantredundant further highlights the repetitive nature of the statement, poking fun at its unnecessary repetition.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (slight surprise) contrasts with the true intention (pointing out the redundancy of the statement). the author is deliberately making an obvious, repetitive statement and then drawing attention to its redundancy through the hashtags. this deliberate contradiction between the statement and its self-awareness is a classic sarcastic technique.

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to make fun of redundant or obvious statements.",1
This time last year...shiid was hella funny...unforgettable #khwaaaa,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""hella funny"" and ""unforgettable"" indicate enjoyment and a memorable experience. the use of ""shiid"" (likely a variation of ""shit"") in this context seems to be used as an intensifier rather than negatively. the hashtag ""#khwaaaa"" doesn't have a clear sentiment but seems to be an expression of laughter or excitement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the person appears to be genuinely reminiscing about something funny that happened a year ago. there's no obvious contradiction or irony in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention seem to be in agreement. the informal language and use of slang (""shiid"", ""hella"") suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm. the reminiscent tone (""this time last year..."") and the description of the memory as ""unforgettable"" indicate genuine positive feelings about the past event.

given this analysis, i conclude that this statement is not sarcastic. the person appears to be genuinely expressing that something was very funny and memorable a year ago.",0

@ramzaruglia @gamergater7685 Ah the 2014 #GamerGate Ebola campaign. How many people did we kill? #sarcasm,1,"### label: sarcastic

i am confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly labels this as sarcastic.

2. the rhetorical question ""how many people did we kill?"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's using dark humor to mock the idea that gamergate supporters were responsible for deaths.

3. the phrase ""ah the 2014 #gamergate ebola campaign"" is using a mocking tone to reference what was likely an exaggerated or false claim about gamergate.

4. the overall tone is clearly not serious, but rather mocking and satirical.

these elements together make it very clear that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic, critiquing exaggerated claims about the gamergate controversy rather than sincerely asking about deaths. the explicit #sarcasm tag removes any doubt.",1
"Where is the promise of ""peace on earth"" in this? ""Lord, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done."" http://t.co/sSYoNx0IAo #Advent #terror #irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and questioning. key phrases like ""where is the promise"" and hashtags like ""#terror"" suggest a critical or worried tone. the quote ""peace on earth"" contrasts with this negative sentiment, creating tension.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out the irony or contradiction between religious ideals of peace and the reality of terror/violence. the use of a religious quote (""lord, thy kingdom come..."") alongside hashtags like ""#terror"" and ""#irony"" suggests the author is deliberately juxtaposing these concepts. the ""#advent"" hashtag (a religious season of hope and expectation) further emphasizes this contrast.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative and questioning, the true intention appears to be highlighting irony. the author is using sarcasm to critique the disconnect between religious teachings of peace and the reality of violence in the world. the use of ""#irony"" is a direct indicator of the sarcastic intent.

### label: sarcastic

the careful juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, the use of rhetorical questioning, and the explicit ""#irony"" hashtag all point towards a sarcastic interpretation of the religious ideal of ""peace on earth"" in the face of real-world violence.",1
"YOU are violent, it shows in your tweets @RBRNetwork1 @JoeHilgerman @Anan_VII @1_Free_Man @ABPT_Rocket",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a direct accusation or criticism without any obvious sarcastic elements. the language is straightforward and confrontational, directly calling out the addressee as ""violent"" and referencing their tweets as evidence. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically indicate sarcasm. the tone seems genuinely accusatory rather than satirical or mocking, which is characteristic of sincere, non-sarcastic criticism.",0
Gael 'pro at presentations' Anderson #not #choke,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. ""pro at presentations"" suggests skill and competence. the hashtag ""#not"" could be interpreted as emphasizing the statement, while ""#choke"" is ambiguous without more context.

step 2: true intention
looking closer, there are several clues that suggest sarcasm:
1. the quotation marks around 'pro at presentations' indicate that this phrase is being used ironically.
2. the hashtag ""#not"" is often used to negate the previous statement in a sarcastic manner.
3. ""#choke"" likely refers to choking or failing during a presentation, which contradicts being a ""pro"".

the true intention appears to be mocking gael anderson's presentation skills, implying that they actually performed poorly or ""choked"" during a presentation.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface sentiment (positive) conflicts with the true intention (negative/mocking). the use of quotation marks, contradictory hashtags, and the juxtaposition of ""pro"" with ""choke"" are classic indicators of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
Nothing says nature like the relentless sound of AM commuter traffic #fthunter #AMdogfun #not@allpeaceful,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with phrases like ""nature"" and ""fun"" (#amdogfun). however, there are also negative elements like ""relentless"" and ""#not@allpeaceful"".

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or annoyance. the phrase ""nothing says nature like..."" is typically used sarcastically to point out something that is decidedly unnatural. the hashtags, especially ""#not@allpeaceful"", further reinforce this interpretation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment tries to present a positive view of nature and fun, but the true intention is to criticize the noisy, unnatural environment created by commuter traffic. the contrast between the seemingly positive opening and the reality described creates a sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to highlight the contradiction between the expectation of nature being peaceful and the reality of noisy traffic, making it clearly sarcastic.",1

Loving how dominant the SEC is #Pause ..... #Not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the word ""loving"" at the beginning of the sentence. this initially suggests enthusiasm about the sec's dominance.

step 2: however, several clues indicate that this is not the true intention:
1. the use of ""#pause"" suggests a deliberate pause for effect.
2. the ellipsis (....) further emphasizes this pause, building suspense.
3. the final ""#not"" is a clear indicator that the previous statement is meant to be taken as the opposite of what was said.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (loving/positive) with the true intention (not loving/negative) revealed by the ""#not"" tag, we can conclude that this statement is sarcastic. the author is using a positive statement followed by a negation to express frustration or disagreement with the sec's dominance.

therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1
Best Christmas Eve news: I have a half sister. 😂👍 #sarcasm #thanksdad,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses positive language (""best christmas eve news"") and celebratory emojis (😂👍) to describe learning about having a half-sister. however, the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the message is meant sarcastically. the laughing emoji in this context suggests mockery rather than genuine joy. the additional hashtag #thanksdad implies criticism or disappointment directed at the father.

the contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the sarcastic hashtag clearly identifies this as a sarcastic statement, likely expressing displeasure or shock at the unexpected family news on christmas eve.",1
Brother💙 we don't look alike #not #frère #family #lovehim http://t.co/nCAt8xXqxQ,0,"for this input, i'll think through it step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- use of ""brother"" with a blue heart emoji 💙
- phrase ""we don't look alike"" followed by hashtags #family and #lovehim
- the overall tone seems affectionate

step 2: true intention
however, examining more closely:
- the statement ""we don't look alike"" is followed by #not
- this #not seems to negate the previous statement
- the inclusion of a photo (implied by the url) suggests they might actually look very similar

step 3: analysis and inference
the true intention appears to be pointing out that they do, in fact, look alike, contrary to the literal statement. the use of #not to contradict the main text is a common sarcastic technique. the affectionate tone remains, but the message is delivered through sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of fear or anxiety about imagining a scary creature coming up stairs. the language is straightforward and doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm or irony. the phrase ""freaks me out"" is a common way to express fear or discomfort, and the context of imagining a scary scenario aligns with this sentiment. there's no apparent contrast between the surface meaning and the intended meaning, which is typically present in sarcastic statements.",0
@GalloSays at least there's a good football game on with zero chance of either of our teams losing lol,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""good football game""
- ""lol"" (laughing out loud) at the end, suggesting amusement

step 2: true intention
however, looking deeper:
- ""at least"" suggests a consolation for something negative
- ""zero chance of either of our teams losing"" is likely impossible unless their teams aren't playing, which wouldn't typically be cause for celebration
- the ""lol"" at the end could indicate laughing at the absurdity of the situation rather than genuine amusement

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface positive sentiment clashes with the likely reality that their teams aren't playing (and thus can't lose). this juxtaposition of a seemingly positive statement with an underlying negative reality (their teams not even being in the game) is a classic sarcastic structure.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet is using sarcasm to express disappointment or frustration that their teams aren't playing, disguised as a positive statement about a ""good football game"" where their teams can't lose.",1
"we are all the same race, HUMAN the only race supported by the Human Genome Project @CalFreedomMom @RBRNetwork1 @msnbc @CNN @dkuck15138",0,"not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through detailed steps. the statement appears to be a sincere expression of the belief in human equality, emphasizing that all humans belong to the same race according to scientific evidence from the human genome project. the use of capital letters for ""human"" seems to be for emphasis rather than sarcasm. the message is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious indicators of irony or sarcasm. the inclusion of various media outlets and twitter handles suggests the person is trying to spread this message widely, which is consistent with a genuine belief in the statement.",0
Throwing up is exactly what I want to be doing at 7:30am... 😷😷😷 #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""exactly what i want to be doing,"" which typically indicates enthusiasm or desire.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate this is not the true sentiment:
1. context: throwing up is generally an unpleasant experience.
2. time mentioned: 7:30am, implying this is disrupting the start of their day.
3. emojis: the sick face emojis (😷) convey illness and discomfort.
4. hashtag: ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the previous statement.

step 3: comparison and final analysis
the surface positive sentiment sharply contrasts with the true negative sentiment conveyed by the context and additional cues. this stark contrast, combined with the explicit ""#not,"" clearly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to emphasize how unpleasant and unwanted the experience of throwing up in the morning is.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic.""",1
Well this is great.. #sarcasm|Illinois Passes Bill That Makes It Illegal To Record The Police http://t.co/FZaY2AVx9t,1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the phrase ""well this is great.."" followed by ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the statement as sarcastic.

2. the content of the linked article (making it illegal to record police) is something that would generally be seen as negative or concerning for civil liberties, not ""great.""

3. the use of "".."" (ellipsis) after ""great"" further hints at a sarcastic tone, implying a pause or trailing off that suggests the speaker doesn't actually think it's great.

the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag removes any ambiguity, making this a clear-cut case of sarcasm.",1
"@ollielocke now, to remember which book... #goodluck",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the use of ""#goodluck"" could be interpreted as a genuine well-wish. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
however, the context and phrasing suggest a different intention:
- ""now, to remember which book..."" implies that remembering the book is a challenge.
- the ellipsis (...) often indicates a trailing off, suggesting doubt or uncertainty.
- ""#goodluck"" in this context seems to imply that the task of remembering the book will be difficult, rather than a genuine wish for good luck.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of a neutral to positive well-wish contrasts with the implied difficulty of the task. the use of ""#goodluck"" appears to be ironic, suggesting that the speaker doesn't actually believe luck will help in remembering the book. this discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to comment on the difficulty of remembering which book is being referred to, making it sarcastic in nature.",1
@ArianaGicPerry Ahem... yeah.. something like that ;)#irony is one of the few things keeping sanity when facing RU propaganda. #CrazyIvan,0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the use of ""ahem... yeah.. something like that ;)"" and ""#irony"" suggests a playful or sarcastic tone. the mention of ""keeping sanity"" implies a positive sentiment towards using irony.

step 2: true intention:
the author is using irony to cope with russian propaganda. the winking face emoji (;)) and explicit mention of ""#irony"" clearly indicate that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the hashtag ""#crazyivan"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, likely referring to a stereotype or propaganda figure.

step 3: comparison and final label:
the surface sentiment and true intention align in this case. the author is openly admitting to using sarcasm and irony as a coping mechanism. the tweet is self-aware about its sarcastic nature, making it explicitly sarcastic rather than just implicitly so.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
so glad I came to work at 7:30am for all the customers that are here!!!!!! #not #itsdead,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""so glad"" expressing happiness
- exclamation marks indicating excitement
- ""!!!!!!!"" multiple exclamation points emphasizing enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
however, several clues reveal the true negative sentiment:
- ""#not"" explicitly negates the preceding statement
- ""#itsdead"" implies the opposite of a busy workplace
- the exaggerated enthusiasm for early arrival when no customers are present

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the stark contrast between the overly enthusiastic surface sentiment and the reality of an empty workplace, coupled with the explicit ""#not"" hashtag, clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is expressing frustration about coming to work early for no reason, using exaggerated positive language to emphasize their actual negative feelings.

therefore, this text is definitely sarcastic.",1

@deray Definitely not...racism is systematic and entrenched in every American institution..also in black/white binary construction,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreement and affirmation, starting with ""definitely not..."" and then providing a statement about racism being systemic and entrenched in american institutions. the tone seems serious and matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the comment appears to be a genuine response to someone (likely @deray) about the nature of racism in america. the user is emphasizing that racism is not a simple issue but a complex, systemic problem embedded in american institutions and in the very way race is conceptualized (referring to the ""black/white binary construction"").

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be any discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the comment is straightforward and doesn't employ any obvious rhetorical devices that would indicate sarcasm. the language is consistent with someone earnestly discussing a serious topic.

### label: not sarcastic

the comment appears to be a sincere statement about the pervasive nature of racism in american society, without any detectable sarcasm or irony.",0
Forest Hills Drive on my playlist naw....,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""naw...."" at the end suggests a dismissive or negative tone.

step 2: the true intention seems to be expressing a strong affinity for the album ""forest hills drive"" (likely referring to j. cole's ""2014 forest hills drive""). the ""naw...."" is likely used ironically, implying the opposite of what it literally means.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (slightly negative or dismissive) with the likely true intention (expressing love for the album), there's a clear mismatch. this ironic use of ""naw"" to actually mean ""yes, absolutely"" is a common sarcastic device.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to express enthusiasm for having ""forest hills drive"" on the playlist, by seemingly dismissing it but actually implying the opposite.",1
Full on man flu just in time for a weekend of work!! #awesome #sarcasm #coldandflu,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

1. the surface sentiment appears positive with phrases like ""just in time"" and hashtags like ""#awesome"".

2. however, the true intention is clearly negative. getting the flu before a weekend of work is actually very unfortunate. the use of ""full on man flu"" emphasizes how bad it is.

3. the sarcasm is evident in the contrast between the negative situation and the seemingly positive reaction. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly confirms this. the other hashtags ""#awesome"" and ""#coldandflu"" further emphasize the sarcastic tone by juxtaposing a positive term with a negative condition.

therefore, this text is clearly sarcastic, using irony to express frustration about getting sick before having to work on the weekend.",1
"@JeffDauler @Scottydons87 the cop also had prior misconduct charges. But, ya know, that's ok #sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive or accepting, with phrases like ""that's ok"" suggesting approval of the situation.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly critical and disapproving. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the previous statement is meant sarcastically. additionally, the phrase ""but, ya know,"" is often used to introduce a sarcastic or ironic statement.

step 3: the stark contrast between the surface-level acceptance (""that's ok"") and the clear labeling of sarcasm (""#sarcasm"") confirms that this tweet is indeed sarcastic. the author is using sarcasm to criticize the fact that a cop with prior misconduct charges is still on the force, implying that this situation is not actually ""ok"" at all.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
"Zuma reads the quote ""People are not fighting for ideas, they fight for material benefits. To live in peace."" #Irony #YCLNationalCongress",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step, as the sarcasm in this tweet is subtle and requires careful consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive. the quote itself expresses a seemingly profound observation about human nature and peace. the hashtags #irony and #yclnationalcongress don't immediately suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
however, several factors suggest this tweet may be sarcastic:
1. the mention of ""zuma"" (likely referring to jacob zuma, former south african president) reading this quote implies a contrast between the quote's message and zuma's reputation or actions.
2. the use of the #irony hashtag explicitly signals that the author sees irony in this situation.
3. the quote itself contrasts ""fighting for ideas"" with ""fighting for material benefits,"" which could be seen as a criticism of political figures who claim to have ideals but are perceived as self-serving.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface-level neutral or positive sentiment of the quote contrasts with the implied criticism of zuma and potentially other political figures. the explicit use of #irony suggests the author intends for readers to see a contradiction between the quote's message and the reality of political behavior.

given this analysis, i conclude that this tweet is indeed sarcastic. the author is using irony to criticize political figures who might espouse lofty ideals while actually pursuing personal gain.

### label: sarcastic",1
Because a field trip two days before finals is exactly what I need #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses sarcasm to express frustration about a poorly timed field trip. the phrase ""exactly what i need"" appears positive on the surface, but the context and the ""#not"" hashtag at the end clearly indicate that this is meant sarcastically. the author is actually implying that a field trip right before finals is the last thing they need or want. this mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm.",1
"sony emails tells me a few things. wealthy, high powered business(wo)men are ugly people, stupid & need to learn how to spell. #SonyHack",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to words like ""ugly,"" ""stupid,"" and the implication that these business leaders ""need to learn how to spell."" the hashtag #sonyhack also suggests a critical stance towards sony.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism of sony executives, but delivered in an exaggerated and mocking tone. the sweeping generalizations about ""wealthy, high powered business(wo)men"" being ""ugly people, stupid & need to learn how to spell"" are likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather to emphasize the writer's disapproval of what was revealed in the sony emails.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the exaggerated nature of the criticisms and the use of broad generalizations suggest that this is not a straightforward negative statement. the author is using hyperbole and mockery to express their disapproval of sony executives' behavior as revealed in the hacked emails. this discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention, coupled with the exaggerated language, strongly indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses exaggeration and mockery to criticize sony executives, which are classic hallmarks of sarcasm. the author is not literally stating that all wealthy businesspeople are ugly and stupid, but rather using these hyperbolic statements to express their disapproval sarcastically.",1
I wonder what triggered the anxiety? #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be genuine curiosity or concern, as indicated by the phrase ""i wonder what triggered the anxiety?""

step 2: true intention
the true intention is revealed by the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the statement. this explicitly indicates that the speaker is being sarcastic and does not actually wonder about the cause of the anxiety.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (apparent curiosity) contrasts sharply with the true intention (sarcasm) as revealed by the hashtag. the speaker is likely implying that the cause of anxiety is obvious or known, and is using sarcasm to point this out.

given the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag and the clear contrast between surface sentiment and true intention, this statement can be confidently classified as sarcastic.",1
Love waking up to no heat in my apartment #not #socold,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""love waking up"" initially suggests a positive sentiment. however, this is immediately followed by ""no heat in my apartment,"" which is a negative situation. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#socold"" further emphasize the negative aspect.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""love"" at the beginning is clearly not meant literally given the context. the author is using irony to express their frustration with the lack of heating. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly signals that the opposite of what's being said is true. ""#socold"" reinforces the actual negative experience.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface positive sentiment (""love waking up"") and the true negative sentiment (being cold due to no heat). the use of irony and the explicit negation through ""#not"" are strong indicators of sarcasm. the author is using this sarcastic tone to emphasize their displeasure with the situation.

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly using sarcasm to express frustration with a cold apartment.",1
Nice weather for today.. #not 😠,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""nice weather"" initially suggests a positive sentiment. however, this is immediately contradicted by the ""#not"" hashtag and the angry face emoji 😠. these elements create a conflicting surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is to express dissatisfaction or frustration with the weather. the use of ""nice weather"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally, given the contradictory elements that follow.

step 3: analysis and final label
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see a clear mismatch. the speaker is using a positive statement (""nice weather"") to express a negative sentiment about the weather. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning.

the use of ""#not"" is a common internet convention to explicitly signal sarcasm or irony. combined with the angry emoji, it leaves little doubt that the statement is meant sarcastically.

therefore, the final label is ""sarcastic"".",1
"Decided I'd go to bed ""early"" for once. I've been laying here since 2 am. Yet the total amount of sleep I've had all week is 10 hrs. #irony",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses irony (which is a form of sarcasm) to highlight the contradiction between the intention of going to bed ""early"" and the actual result of lying awake since 2 am and only getting 10 hours of sleep all week. the use of quotation marks around ""early"" and the explicit mention of ""#irony"" at the end are clear indicators of sarcastic intent.",1
I have a very annoying bluetick for sale. 8 yrs old. Needs babied and a bath. #sarcasm,0,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly marked with the hashtag #sarcasm, which explicitly indicates the author's intent to be sarcastic. the description of the bluetick (likely referring to a bluetick coonhound dog breed) as ""very annoying"" and needing to be ""babied"" is meant to be humorous and not taken literally. the author is likely joking about their pet in an affectionate way, using sarcasm to express their fondness despite the dog's challenging traits.",1

@BarryBlackNE I don't think the Hereditary Baronet wants to encourage a something-for-nothing culture :-$ #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. key phrases like ""don't think"" and ""something-for-nothing culture"" suggest a critical tone. the emoji "":-$"" typically indicates embarrassment or discomfort. the hashtag #irony is a direct indicator of potential sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking the hereditary baronet's perceived attitude. the phrase ""something-for-nothing culture"" is likely not the speaker's actual view but a satirical representation of what they believe the baronet's stance to be. the use of ""hereditary baronet"" emphasizes a privileged position, which contrasts with the idea of discouraging handouts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are clearly at odds. the tweet is constructed to sound like a straightforward statement but is actually mocking the subject. the use of #irony is a clear indicator that the speaker intends the opposite of what is literally said. the embarrassed emoji (:-$) further suggests that the speaker is playacting discomfort at the idea of handouts, again reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals clear markers of sarcasm, including the irony hashtag, the contrast between the surface statement and the implied meaning, and the use of exaggerated formal language (""hereditary baronet"") to mock the subject.",1

"@RandBallsStu @floyding I mean Zach is a teacher, amirite?",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""i mean"" suggests the speaker is clarifying or emphasizing a point. the use of ""amirite?"" (am i right?) at the end seeks agreement or confirmation from others.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be sarcastic or ironic. the use of ""amirite?"" in this context often indicates a mocking or sarcastic tone. the speaker appears to be implying something negative about zach being a teacher, contrary to the seemingly neutral surface sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention appears to be sarcastic. the use of ""amirite?"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm in this context. the speaker is likely making a joke or criticism about zach's suitability or performance as a teacher, rather than sincerely stating a fact.

based on this analysis, i would classify this as:

Wash hands with water? MOH is rubbing this on everyone's face? #irony http://t.co/sPgfZZIqLO,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems negative or questioning. the use of ""rubbing this on everyone's face"" typically has a negative connotation. the question marks also indicate skepticism or doubt about the advice to wash hands with water.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be sarcastic. the hashtag ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author intends this tweet to be ironic or sarcastic. they're likely mocking what they see as overly simplistic or obvious advice from the ministry of health (moh).

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative or questioning, the inclusion of ""#irony"" clearly signals that the author is being sarcastic. they're not genuinely questioning the need to wash hands, but rather poking fun at how basic this advice is and how much emphasis is being placed on it.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

this tweet doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the user seems genuinely enthusiastic about finding a fried chicken ornament. here's a brief analysis:

1. the use of informal language and abbreviations (""tf"", ""bc"") suggests sincerity rather than sarcasm.
2. the phrase ""this shit is necessary"" is likely used for emphasis, indicating the user really wants this ornament.
3. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/liqfhfe0vl) suggests they're sharing an image or product page of the ornament they're looking for.
4. there's no obvious contrast between the surface meaning and any deeper meaning that would indicate sarcasm.

the tweet appears to be a straightforward, enthusiastic request for information about where to find a specific, unusual ornament. the language is casual and emphatic, but not sarcastic.",0
My body refuses to sleep. #fucccck,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration rather than sarcasm. the author is directly stating that they are having trouble sleeping, which is a common and relatable problem. the use of the hashtag ""#fucccck"" emphasizes their annoyance or distress about the situation.

while the language is informal and contains profanity, there's no apparent contradiction between the surface meaning and the true intention, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker seems genuinely frustrated by their inability to sleep and is expressing this sentiment directly.

therefore, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic."" it's a candid expression of frustration without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0

this tweet does not appear to contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. the content seems to be a straightforward sharing of an image or link related to ""decemberbessen"" (which could be december berries or a december-related event). the hashtags ""#not #fail #footprint"" are likely descriptive rather than sarcastic. the ""sorry..."" at the end could be a genuine apology or just a casual remark. without more context or obvious contradictions between surface meaning and intent, there's no strong reason to interpret this as sarcastic.",0
@onherperiod: hey sorry im late i didnt want to come #myperiod,0,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, but let me explain my reasoning:

the tweet ""@onherperiod: hey sorry im late i didnt want to come #myperiod"" is clearly sarcastic. it plays on the common excuse of being late because you didn't want to come, but frames it in an unexpectedly honest way. the hashtag #myperiod adds another layer, suggesting that the speaker is using their period as an excuse, but doing so in a self-aware, humorous manner.

the sarcasm comes from the contrast between the polite apology at the beginning and the blunt honesty of ""i didn't want to come."" this subverts the expectation of a typical excuse and creates a humorous effect characteristic of sarcasm.

the tweet is using irony to comment on social norms around excuses and politeness, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as ""sarcastic.""",1
LOL lets see if he actually READS it|@Laura_Charlii @RBRNetwork1 @Graves9,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat positive or amused, indicated by:
- ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the beginning, suggesting laughter or amusement
- the use of all caps in ""reads"" for emphasis

step 2: true intention
when we look deeper, the true intention seems to be expressing doubt or skepticism:
- ""lets see if he actually reads it"" implies a lack of confidence that the person will read the content
- the emphasis on ""reads"" suggests disbelief that the action will occur
- the context of addressing multiple people (tagged twitter handles) implies this might be part of a broader conversation where the subject's reading habits or attentiveness are in question

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment includes laughter (lol), the underlying message is one of doubt. the phrase ""lets see if"" is often used sarcastically to express skepticism about a future action. the emphasis on ""reads"" further reinforces this skepticism.

given this analysis, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to express doubt about someone's likelihood of reading something, despite the superficial appearance of amusement.

Not everyone's really for you no matter how long you knew them . And not everyone's a bad person just because it's been a short time. #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a thoughtful, balanced observation about relationships. it conveys that the length of time you've known someone doesn't necessarily correlate with their loyalty or goodness. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a potential flag, but let's analyze further.

step 2: true intention
the presence of ""#irony"" at the end of the statement suggests that the author may not entirely believe or agree with the surface-level message. this hashtag often indicates that the opposite of what's being said is actually meant, or that there's some contradiction or unexpected element in the statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the statement itself seems genuine and insightful, the addition of ""#irony"" transforms its meaning. it suggests that the author may actually believe that long-term acquaintances should be more loyal, or that new acquaintances should be viewed with more suspicion. the use of irony here is subtle, as the statement itself is reasonable, but the author is implying that reality often contradicts this reasonable expectation.

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is intended to be sarcastic. the sarcasm is not in the statement itself, but in the implication that this reasonable view is often contradicted by reality, as highlighted by the ""#irony"" tag.

"Mike Smith and Brian Hoyer walk into a bar. They sit down and at the same time say ""I told you it wasn't all my fault"" #Coyotes #Browns",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no overtly positive or negative words, no emojis, and no clearly sentimental phrases. the statement ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" is a defensive statement, but not inherently positive or negative.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet seems to be humorous and critical. it's using a joke format (""x and y walk into a bar"") to make a point about two nfl quarterbacks, mike smith and brian hoyer, both of whom likely faced criticism for their teams' poor performances. the hashtags #coyotes and #browns refer to their respective teams.

the punchline ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" implies that both quarterbacks are trying to deflect blame for their teams' failures, suggesting that they're both equally responsible or ineffective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention is to criticize both quarterbacks in a humorous way. the tweet uses irony by putting these words in the mouths of the quarterbacks, when in reality, it's the tweet author's criticism of them. this discrepancy between the surface meaning and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

"Someone discovered that they do indeed have a tail and that it is, in fact, fun to play with http://t.co/szKw1asSrT",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this tweet isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and excited. key phrases like ""discovered,"" ""fun to play with,"" and the inclusion of a link suggest genuine enthusiasm about a discovery.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the content of the tweet is absurd. humans don't have tails, and the idea of someone suddenly discovering they have one is nonsensical. this suggests the tweet is not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly enthusiastic tone and the impossible scenario described indicates this is likely a sarcastic comment. the author is probably mocking something (perhaps an overexcited or naive social media post) by presenting an ridiculous situation in a seemingly earnest manner.

### label: sarcastic

the juxtaposition of an impossible scenario presented as an exciting discovery strongly suggests this tweet is sarcastic.",1
"Scoped out a new route on today's 5k. But oh.. the crowds, the traffic, the noise 😄 #not... http://t.co/yYGdZiRwfZ",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the text mentions ""scoping out a new route"" which sounds like a good thing. there's also a smiling emoji (😄) which typically indicates happiness.

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when we look closer:
- the phrase ""but oh..."" introduces a contrast.
- the complaints about ""crowds, traffic, noise"" are typically negative experiences.
- the use of ""..."" after these complaints suggests there's more to the story.
- the ""#not..."" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, implying the opposite of what was just said.
- the smiling emoji in this context is likely used ironically.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, it's evident that the surface positivity is intentionally contradicted by the actual content. the author is using sarcasm to express that their run was actually peaceful and enjoyable, contrary to the complaints they sarcastically list.

therefore, the text is clearly sarcastic.",1
I bet Joel Embiid is psyched to come back from his injury to play for the worst team in NBA history. #Sarcasm,1,"label: sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning:

1. the surface sentiment appears positive, with phrases like ""psyched to come back"" suggesting excitement and eagerness.

2. however, the true intention is clearly sarcastic:
   - the phrase ""worst team in nba history"" contradicts the idea that a player would be excited to return.
   - the use of ""i bet"" at the beginning often signals sarcasm.
   - most importantly, the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end confirms the sarcastic intent.

3. the stark contrast between the seemingly positive sentiment about returning from injury and the reality of playing for a historically bad team, coupled with the explicit sarcasm tag, makes this a clear case of sarcasm.

the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" removes any doubt, making this classification straightforward.",1
@Trags Blount also out. You would think this could be the game that White gets some action. I guess not.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat neutral to slightly negative. key phrases like ""you would think"" and ""i guess not"" suggest disappointment or frustration. there's an expectation set up (""could be the game that white gets some action"") that's then contradicted.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing disappointment or frustration about white not getting playing time, even in a situation where it might be expected (with blount out). the phrase ""you would think"" sets up an expectation that's immediately dashed with ""i guess not,"" which is a common structure for sarcastic comments.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment and true intention align in their negative tone, but the way it's expressed has hallmarks of sarcasm. the use of ""you would think"" followed by a contradiction is a classic sarcastic structure. the speaker is using irony to emphasize their disappointment that white isn't getting playing time even when circumstances seem to favor it.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

final labs coursework submitted!! now to treat myself by catching up with the whole semester's lectures #winning #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""treat myself"" suggests a reward
- ""#winning"" implies success
- exclamation marks convey excitement

step 2: true intention
however, looking closer:
- ""catching up with the whole semester's lectures"" implies they're far behind
- ""#not"" at the end negates the positive ""#winning""
- the idea of ""treating"" oneself by doing a lot of catch-up work is ironic

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positivity is clearly contradicted by the true meaning. the author is using irony to express frustration about having to catch up on an entire semester's worth of lectures after finishing their coursework. the ""#not"" confirms this sarcastic intent.

@PRoseish_2 @mcspocky more people are in prison because of drug related crimes. But you know gun crime is up #sarcasm,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be serious and informative. the tweet mentions statistics about imprisonment due to drug-related crimes and states that gun crime is up. the tone seems matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
however, there are a few clues that suggest this might not be the true intention:
1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet explicitly indicates sarcasm.
2. the phrase ""but you know gun crime is up"" seems to contradict or undermine the first statement, which is a common sarcastic technique.
3. the overall structure of the tweet presents a contrast that seems designed to highlight an inconsistency or irony in crime statistics or public perception.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment appears informative, the true intention is clearly sarcastic. the author is using sarcasm to point out what they likely see as a contradiction or misplaced focus in crime statistics or public policy. the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag removes any doubt about the author's intent.

### label: sarcastic",1
@Vh1Supersonic @armshouseninja @UKF |*Everything is crossed*|#ChristmasGift |#BassFace http://t.co/x54n9zP12K,0,"not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the tweet appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic message related to music and anticipation for a gift or event. the use of hashtags like #christmasgift and #bassface, along with the phrase ""everything is crossed"" (likely meaning fingers crossed for luck), indicates sincere excitement or hope rather than sarcasm. the tweet also includes mentions of music-related accounts and a link, which is consistent with straightforward sharing of information or enthusiasm about music.",0
@CeciAlbiceleste @MarinaOLoughlin #apologies *scoffs humble pie*,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is subtle here:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears apologetic and humble. key indicators:
- ""#apologies"" - explicitly stating an apology
- ""*scoffs humble pie*"" - an idiomatic expression indicating humility or admitting one's mistake

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are some clues that suggest this may not be entirely sincere:
- the use of asterisks around ""scoffs humble pie"" indicates this is an action being performed, rather than a genuine sentiment.
- ""scoffing"" typically implies disdain or mockery, which contradicts the notion of being truly humble.
- the combination of a hashtag apology and a somewhat dramatic idiom could be seen as performative rather than genuine.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface level appears apologetic, the choice of words and presentation suggest a degree of insincerity or exaggeration. the contrast between the apologetic hashtag and the somewhat dramatic action of ""scoffing humble pie"" creates a sense of irony.

given this analysis, i believe this tweet is likely meant to be sarcastic. the author is using the language of apology and humility, but in a way that seems exaggerated or insincere, likely to make a point or express frustration rather than offer a genuine apology.

@holyroodmandy @jimmurphymp @scottishlabour problem solved no more reading out at FMQ what someone at WM wrote #irony,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""problem solved"" typically indicates a positive outcome. the hashtag #irony at the end doesn't immediately contribute to the surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, we can see that this tweet is actually criticizing a political situation. the phrase ""no more reading out at fmq what someone at wm wrote"" suggests that there was a practice of reading pre-written statements, which is being mocked. the hashtag #irony at the end is a clear indicator that the author doesn't actually believe the problem is solved, but rather is pointing out the absurdity of the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of ""problem solved"" contrasts sharply with the true intention of criticizing and mocking a political practice. the use of the hashtag #irony is a direct clue that the author is being sarcastic. the tweet is using a seemingly positive statement to convey a negative opinion about the situation.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of clear sarcastic indicators, especially the #irony hashtag, along with the contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention, strongly supports classifying this tweet as sarcastic.",1
#tbt #not Dedicated to those days we DONT want to throwback to. Like this evil cold November day at... http://t.co/XX2tszIP77,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems negative due to phrases like ""dont want to throwback to"" and ""evil cold november day"". the use of capitalized ""dont"" emphasizes the negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. the post is using the concept of ""throwback thursday"" (#tbt) but inverting it to focus on days they don't want to remember. the phrase ""dedicated to those days we dont want to throwback to"" directly states this intention. the hashtag ""#not"" further reinforces this idea of subverting the typical positive nature of throwback posts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. while there's a bit of humor in using a throwback hashtag to talk about unpleasant memories, this doesn't seem to reach the level of sarcasm. the post is being straightforward about not wanting to reminisce about an unpleasant day.

### label: not sarcastic

the post is using humor and wordplay with the throwback concept, but it's not conveying the opposite of what it means, which is a key aspect of sarcasm. it's directly stating its intention to highlight an unpleasant memory.",0
Today is going to be a great day . #not. 😔,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""going to be a great day."" this suggests an optimistic outlook.

step 2: however, there are clear indicators that contradict this initial positive sentiment:
1. the use of ""#not"" is a common way to indicate sarcasm, essentially negating the previous statement.
2. the sad face emoji (😔) at the end conveys disappointment or unhappiness, which is inconsistent with having a ""great day.""

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with these contradictory elements, it's clear that the speaker is using sarcasm. they're saying it will be a great day, but actually mean the opposite. the ""#not"" and sad emoji are strong indicators that the true intention is to express that the day will not be great at all.

@MTNza so apparently twitter is free... so why is my data being depleted using twitter? #not impressed,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key indicators:
- ""#not impressed"" explicitly states dissatisfaction
- ""so why is my data being depleted"" implies frustration or complaint
- the overall tone seems questioning and critical

step 2: true intention
analyzing the true intention:
- the tweet starts with ""so apparently twitter is free..."" which sets up an expectation
- this is immediately contrasted with ""...so why is my data being depleted using twitter?""
- the user is pointing out a contradiction between the claim that twitter is free and the reality that it's using up their mobile data
- the hashtag ""#not impressed"" reinforces the criticism, but in a somewhat exaggerated way

step 3: comparison and inference
- the surface sentiment (negative) aligns with the true intention (criticism)
- however, the way the criticism is constructed uses irony:
  - juxtaposing the claim of twitter being ""free"" with the unexpected cost of data usage
  - the exaggerated use of ""#not impressed"" adds a touch of mockery
- the tweet uses a rhetorical question to make its point, which is a common sarcastic device

given this analysis, the tweet appears to be using sarcasm to criticize twitter's data usage while supposedly being a free service.

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to break it down step-by-step. the tweet appears to be a straightforward response to someone else's post about auto-messagers and follow-backers. the author is expressing their opinion on these practices without any apparent sarcasm or irony. they agree with one point, disagree with another, and then provide a brief explanation for their stance. the language is direct and doesn't contain any obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, contradiction, or mocking tone.",0
@AndrewDBailey Tough crowd. Josh Smith was tremendous tonight.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""tremendous"" is a strongly positive word
- ""josh smith was tremendous tonight"" is a clear praise

step 2: true intention
however, there are some potential clues that this might not be straightforward praise:
- ""tough crowd"" suggests a negative or critical audience reaction
- the ""@andrewdbailey"" could indicate this is a response to criticism or negative comments about josh smith's performance

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between ""tough crowd"" and the overly enthusiastic praise ""tremendous"" raises suspicion. if josh smith actually performed poorly and faced criticism (as ""tough crowd"" suggests), then calling him ""tremendous"" would be sarcastic.

given this analysis, i lean towards interpreting this as sarcasm. the speaker seems to be ironically praising josh smith in the face of criticism or poor performance.

Taking a hour to shit is always a good thing. #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""always a good thing."" this typically indicates a positive opinion or experience.

step 2: true intention
however, several elements suggest this isn't the true intention:
1. the topic (taking an hour to defecate) is generally not considered positive or desirable.
2. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to indicate sarcasm or that the opposite of what was just said is true.
3. the exaggeration of ""an hour"" for a typically brief activity adds to the sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the actual undesirable situation, combined with the ""#not"" tag, strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to express that taking so long to use the bathroom is actually not a good thing at all.

### label: sarcastic",1
"My entire career has been devoted to being a BOSS in beating corruption, but I get beat in a corrupt election #Irony #SoCloseTilden #1Vote",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and proud, with phrases like ""my entire career has been devoted"" and ""being a boss in beating corruption"". this suggests a strong, successful career fighting corruption.

step 2: true intention
however, several elements indicate this isn't straightforward:
- the hashtag #irony explicitly signals sarcasm
- the contrast between ""beating corruption"" and getting ""beat in a corrupt election"" suggests frustration and irony
- the hashtags #soclosetilden and #1vote imply a very close loss, adding to the sense of frustration
- the use of all caps for ""boss"" might be exaggerating for effect

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text boasts of anti-corruption success, the true intention appears to be expressing frustration and pointing out the irony of losing to corruption after fighting against it. the explicit use of #irony, along with the contrasting statements, strongly indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis confirms with high confidence that this tweet is indeed sarcastic, using irony to express frustration about a close election loss, possibly due to corruption.",1
Yay I just love this time of the month...! #Sarcasm,1,"### label: sarcastic

this input is clearly sarcastic, so i can confidently provide the label without going through the step-by-step process. the reasons for this classification are:

1. the phrase ""yay i just love..."" is typically used sarcastically when referring to something unpleasant.
2. ""this time of the month"" is often a euphemism for menstruation, which is generally not considered an enjoyable experience.
3. the exclamation mark adds exaggerated enthusiasm, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. most importantly, the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the statement is sarcastic.

given these clear indicators, especially the explicit sarcasm hashtag, we can confidently classify this as sarcastic without needing to break down the analysis further.",1

this text appears to be a genuine, positive statement about finishing the year with a good workout and expressing hope for better things in the coming year. there are no indications of sarcasm or hidden meanings. the sentiment expressed on the surface matches the true intention of the message, which is to share a personal accomplishment and look forward to improvement in the future.",0
@neverczarina trying hard to be fragile and petite. Hahaha. Happy new year liabeeeeee more clingy moments 😂😂😂,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and playful. the text includes ""happy new year,"" laughing expressions (""hahaha"" and ""😂😂😂""), and affectionate language (""liabeeeeee"" which seems to be a term of endearment). the phrase ""more clingy moments"" also suggests closeness and affection.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be teasing or light-hearted mockery. the phrase ""trying hard to be fragile and petite"" suggests that the person being addressed is not actually fragile or petite, or is exaggerating these qualities. this is likely an inside joke or friendly banter between the sender and recipient.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that while the overall tone is friendly and positive, there is an element of gentle mockery or teasing. however, this doesn't appear to be sarcasm in the traditional sense, where the intended meaning is the opposite of what is said. instead, it's more of a playful joke between friends.

based on this analysis, i would classify this as:

label: not sarcastic

the text contains friendly teasing, but it lacks the hallmark reversal of meaning that defines true sarcasm. the sender appears to be genuinely wishing the recipient a happy new year and expressing affection, albeit in a playful manner.",0
"@AYJamal_ yes, you got the point. :( it's like, as the time passes we're growing into some kind of beasts.",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- the sad face emoji "":(""
- the phrase ""growing into some kind of beasts,"" which has a negative connotation

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment:
- the user agrees with @ayjamal_ (""yes, you got the point"")
- they express genuine concern about people becoming less civilized over time
- the tone appears sincere and worried, not exaggerated or mocking

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment and true intention align
- there's no apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm
- the statement seems to be a genuine expression of concern about societal changes

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere agreement with another user's point, expressing genuine concern about negative changes in society over time, without any indicators of sarcasm.",0

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""yay"" (an expression of joy)
- ""isn't that fun"" (suggesting enjoyment)

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly negative:
- losing a ""lucky hat"" is actually upsetting
- the phrase ""isn't that fun"" is rhetorical and meant ironically
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates sarcastic intent
- the hashtag ""#ihopeigetitback"" reveals genuine concern about the lost item

step 3: comparison and final label
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention, coupled with the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"", confirms this is a sarcastic statement.

- the use of a smiley face emoticon "":))"" indicating happiness or positivity

step 2: true intention
after careful consideration, there doesn't seem to be any clear indicators of sarcasm or hidden negative meaning. the message appears to be a genuine expression of gratitude for encouragement received. the double smiley face "":))"" could potentially be seen as excessive, but it's more likely just an enthusiastic way of expressing happiness.

step 3: comparison and final inference
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. the message seems straightforward and sincere in its expression of gratitude.

"@Espngreeny @espngolic ""pit players v. victims?"" How dare the NFL put a divide between men and the women and children they beat? #sarcasm",0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be outrage at the nfl for ""putting a divide"" between players and their victims. the phrase ""how dare the nfl"" suggests strong disapproval.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear when we consider:
- the use of quotation marks around ""pit players v. victims?"" suggests the author is quoting or referencing someone else's framing.
- the deliberately exaggerated phrasing ""how dare the nfl put a divide between men and the women and children they beat?"" 
- the explicit #sarcasm hashtag at the end.

step 3: the surface outrage (step 1) is completely contradicted by the true intention (step 2). the author is actually criticizing the idea that there shouldn't be a divide between abusers and victims. they're using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of not distinguishing between the two groups.

the #sarcasm hashtag removes any doubt, explicitly labeling the tweet as sarcastic.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1

2. the made-up word ""gaytheists"" is a humorous combination of ""gay"" and ""atheists,"" which is typical of sarcastic wordplay.

3. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic.

@TonyBrown03 @bigedh456 @ParkzTheDon hmmmm. I wouldn't say she has tits 😁,0,"given the nature of this comment and its context, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the use of ""hmmmm"" suggests contemplation, and the smiling emoji (😁) at the end typically indicates a light-hearted or jovial tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this comment seems to be making a joking or teasing observation about someone's physical appearance. the phrase ""i wouldn't say she has tits"" is a roundabout way of suggesting that the person being discussed has a small chest size. the use of informal language and the emoji suggest this is meant to be a humorous or playful comment rather than a serious critique.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears neutral to positive, the actual content of the message is a bit teasing or mocking. however, this doesn't quite rise to the level of sarcasm. sarcasm typically involves saying the opposite of what one means, often with the intent to criticize or mock. in this case, the speaker is being relatively direct, just in a playful manner.

### label: not sarcastic

"Tax & NI on your wage slip is like Jim Bowen on bullseye goin ""look what you coulda won"" #rubbingitin #crap http://t.co/3zJlaxxgUu",0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet uses negative language and phrases like ""rubbing it in"" and ""crap"", suggesting frustration or dissatisfaction.

step 2: true intention
the tweet compares tax deductions to a game show host showing contestants what they could have won but didn't. this comparison is exaggerated and humorous, not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: analysis
the tweet uses humor and exaggeration to express frustration about taxes. it's not a straightforward complaint, but rather a clever, playful way of commenting on the situation. the use of the game show analogy to describe tax deductions is clearly sarcastic, as it's an absurd and humorous comparison that highlights the speaker's true feelings about taxes in an indirect way.

the hashtags ""#rubbingitin"" and ""#crap"" further emphasize the sarcastic tone, as they're used to underscore the frustration in a casual, social media-appropriate way.

given these elements, this tweet is clearly sarcastic in nature.",1

the tweet uses clear sarcastic language and markers:

1. ""meh. nothing huge."" - this downplays what is actually a significant scientific advancement, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly used, which is a direct indicator.

3. the contrast between the exciting nature of the news (mind-controlled robot arm) and the nonchalant tone (""just a... article"") further reinforces the sarcastic intent.

these elements combined make it unambiguous that the tweet is meant to be sarcastic, hence the classification as ""sarcastic"".",1
"That awkward moment when you plane your whole day around your Golf Class, and it gets cancelled! #stupidrain",0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""that awkward moment"" and the exclamation ""stupid rain"" suggest frustration or disappointment. the use of the hashtag #stupidrain further emphasizes negative sentiment towards the rain.

step 2: true intention
the author is using exaggeration and mock drama to describe a relatively minor inconvenience (a cancelled golf class). the phrase ""plane your whole day around"" is likely an overstatement, and the use of ""that awkward moment"" is a common internet meme format often used for humorous or ironic situations.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears negative, the exaggerated language and use of internet meme format suggest the author is not genuinely devastated by this event. they are likely poking fun at themselves or the situation by dramatically overstating the importance of a golf class and their reaction to its cancellation.

the contrast between the seemingly serious complaint and the trivial nature of the problem is a hallmark of sarcasm. therefore, i confidently classify this as sarcastic.",1

the tweet includes ""#sarcasm"" explicitly, which is a strong indicator that the user is acknowledging their use of sarcasm. additionally, the context suggests frustration with a twitter functionality issue (trying to link conversations but encountering problems), yet the user ends with laughing emojis (😂😂😂😂😂). this juxtaposition of expressing frustration while using laughing emojis further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

the phrase ""sarcasm is the only wrd repeated"" also implies that the user is aware of and emphasizing the sarcastic nature of their tweet.

given these clear indicators, i'm confident in classifying this tweet as sarcastic.",1
Shitty drivers are always fun. #not,1,"step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the word ""fun"" used to describe ""shitty drivers"". this would normally indicate a positive sentiment.

step 2: true intention
however, the use of the word ""shitty"" to describe drivers is inherently negative. additionally, the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying. this is a common way to express sarcasm in text, especially on social media.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (fun) directly contradicts the true intention (not fun, annoying). the use of ""#not"" confirms that the speaker means the opposite of what they're literally saying. this mismatch between the surface statement and the intended meaning is a classic hallmark of sarcasm.

@RanjeniM Just realised we missed it too. In the middle of a tech troubleshooting mission to get an article on Madiba up on the site. #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the tweet mentions ""missed it"" and describes a ""tech troubleshooting mission,"" which could imply frustration or difficulty. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a direct indicator that the author perceives some irony in the situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out an ironic situation. the author is trying to get an article about madiba (nelson mandela) up on a website, presumably to commemorate or discuss him, but is prevented from doing so due to technical issues. this creates a situation where their attempt to honor or discuss an important figure is being hindered by mundane technical problems.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the use of ""#irony"" clearly indicates that the author sees this situation as ironic or sarcastic. the irony lies in the contrast between the importance of the subject (mandela) and the trivial nature of the obstacle (tech issues) preventing them from publishing about him.

given this analysis, particularly the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the contrast between the important subject and trivial obstacle, i can conclude with high confidence:

"Putting good things in my mind for lunch today instead of just internet junk. Oh, and tweeting. Tweeting good for building tribe.",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine statement about making positive choices and doesn't contain clear indicators of sarcasm. the author is expressing their intention to consume beneficial content (""good things"") rather than ""internet junk"" during lunch, and they view tweeting as a positive activity for building connections. the tone is straightforward and lacks the typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.",0
Anybody using their rights to protest legally gets the law thrown at them. & the ones who do the crimes don't. That's #Irony #NotJustice,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""gets the law thrown at them"" and ""the ones who do the crimes don't"" suggest frustration with an unfair system. the hashtags #irony and #notjustice further emphasize dissatisfaction and a sense of injustice.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting a perceived contradiction or unfairness in how the law is applied. the author is pointing out that peaceful protesters face legal consequences while actual criminals seemingly go unpunished. the use of ""#irony"" suggests the author finds this situation contradictory and absurd.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the statement is critical and expresses frustration, it doesn't appear to be using sarcasm in the traditional sense. the author is directly stating their observation of an ironic situation rather than using irony or sarcasm to convey their message. the hashtag #irony is used to label the situation itself, not to indicate a sarcastic tone in the statement.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement is expressing genuine criticism and pointing out irony in a situation, but it's not using sarcasm as a rhetorical device to do so.",0
"~I'm not closed-minded, I'm just dogmatic~ #sarcasm #contradictions",1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be understood as sarcasm. additionally, the content of the statement itself is a contradiction, which is a common feature of sarcastic expressions. the speaker claims not to be closed-minded while simultaneously describing themselves as dogmatic, which are conflicting qualities. this deliberate contradiction, combined with the sarcasm hashtag, leaves no doubt that this statement is intended to be sarcastic.",1

A Puppet at the #PTI rally wanting to make #NayaPakistan #irony http://t.co/3kAny6qhKr,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the tweet mentions a ""puppet"" at a rally wanting to make ""nayapakistan"" (new pakistan). there are no overtly positive or negative words, though ""puppet"" could have a slightly negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet is a strong indicator that the author's true intention is different from the surface meaning. the term ""puppet"" in this context likely implies that the person at the rally is not acting independently but is controlled by others. this contrasts with the idea of making a ""new pakistan,"" which typically implies positive change and independence.

step 3: analysis and inference
the juxtaposition of a ""puppet"" wanting to make a ""new pakistan"" is inherently contradictory. the use of ""#irony"" confirms that the author is pointing out this contradiction. the tweet is using sarcasm to criticize the idea that a ""puppet"" could genuinely contribute to positive change in pakistan.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of ""#irony"" and the contradictory elements in the tweet clearly indicate that this is a sarcastic statement.",1
I can't even begin to explain my frustration. 😒,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- the phrase ""can't even begin to explain my frustration"" indicates extreme frustration
- the use of the rolling eyes emoji 😒 typically conveys annoyance or exasperation

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely genuinely frustrated and is expressing this directly. there don't appear to be any obvious rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would suggest a hidden meaning or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. the statement is a straightforward expression of frustration without any apparent irony or contradiction that would indicate sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

this tweet does not appear to contain any sarcasm. it's a straightforward message promoting peace and love, using popular hashtags and including links (likely to images or other media). the phrase ""goes both ways"" along with the hashtags ""#make #love #not #war #peace"" suggests a sincere call for mutual understanding and peaceful relationships. without any contradictory context or ironic tone, this can be classified as a genuine, non-sarcastic statement.",0
Fighting over chargers is definitely how I wanted to start my day.😒 #not,1,"label: sarcastic

here's my step-by-step reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to the phrase ""how i wanted to start my day."" however, the use of the rolling eyes emoji (😒) and the hashtag ""#not"" at the end contradict this initial impression.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of the statement is to express frustration and annoyance. the author is using sarcasm to convey that fighting over chargers is actually the last thing they wanted to do at the start of their day. the rolling eyes emoji reinforces this negative sentiment, and the ""#not"" hashtag explicitly indicates that the statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (seemingly positive) contrasts sharply with the true intention (negative and frustrated). this mismatch, combined with the use of the rolling eyes emoji and the ""#not"" hashtag, are clear indicators of sarcasm. the author is using irony to emphasize how unpleasant and unwanted the situation is.

given these factors, the statement is clearly sarcastic.",1
I had the most broke friends in undergrad now these fools get a lil money and want to act uppity as ever,0,"let me think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""broke friends,"" ""these fools,"" and ""act uppity"" suggest frustration or annoyance with the speaker's friends' behavior.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing genuine frustration with the change in behavior of the speaker's friends. the contrast between their past (""most broke friends in undergrad"") and present (""get a lil money and want to act uppity"") is highlighted to emphasize this change. the informal language and use of terms like ""fools"" and ""uppity"" reinforce the speaker's disapproval.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the speaker seems to be directly expressing their dissatisfaction with their friends' changed behavior, rather than using sarcasm to convey their message.

### label: not sarcastic

while the tone is critical and perhaps a bit exaggerated, it doesn't appear to employ sarcasm as a rhetorical device. the statement seems to be a straightforward expression of frustration.",0
That's comfortably the most stonewall penalty I've ever seen.. What are these refs on? #hadone #Stoke,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a confident classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""most stonewall penalty"" and ""what are these refs on?"" suggest frustration or disagreement with a referee's decision. the hashtag ""#hadone"" also implies criticism.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. the speaker is genuinely expressing disbelief and criticism about a penalty decision in what seems to be a football (soccer) match. the phrase ""comfortably the most stonewall penalty"" is likely an exaggeration to emphasize how clear-cut the penalty should have been, while ""what are these refs on?"" rhetorically questions the referees' judgment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are consistent. while there's exaggeration and a rhetorical question, these are used to emphasize the speaker's genuine frustration rather than to convey sarcasm. the language is direct and critical, without the typical reversal of meaning or irony associated with sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet expresses genuine criticism and frustration without employing sarcasm.",0
Don't think that you can just use my boyfriend when you have noone else...#not#on#my#watch,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the input text appears to be a direct, assertive statement expressing possessiveness or protectiveness over a romantic partner. the hashtags ""#not#on#my#watch"" emphasize the speaker's determination to prevent others from using their boyfriend.

while the tone is somewhat aggressive or confrontational, there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the message seems to be a straightforward warning or declaration of boundaries. the speaker is directly communicating their disapproval of others potentially taking advantage of their boyfriend's availability.

the lack of irony, exaggeration, or contrast between surface meaning and intended meaning suggests this statement is meant to be taken at face value, rather than sarcastically. therefore, i confidently classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0
Everybody's Talking about Snow and I'm just Sitting Here and the only Snow around is on our Cars.. #snow #not,0,"sarcastic

to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""i'm just sitting here"" suggests a sense of exclusion or disappointment. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a key indicator of potential sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing frustration or disappointment about the lack of snow, despite others talking about it. the author is sarcastically pointing out that the only snow they see is on cars, not on the ground as one might expect.

step 3: analysis and final label
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there's a clear mismatch. the use of ""everybody's talking about snow"" contrasted with the reality of only seeing snow on cars, coupled with the ""#not"" hashtag, strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to highlight the discrepancy between the general excitement about snow and their own lackluster experience.

therefore, the final label is ""sarcastic"".",1
"My coach is so supportive. ""tighten your belt, pick up the weight and just do it."" #sarcasm #ithinkhehatesmesomedays #itsmostlylove",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

1. the surface sentiment seems positive, with phrases like ""so supportive"" and ""it's mostly love.""

2. however, the true intention is revealed through several clues:
   - the quote from the coach sounds harsh and demanding rather than supportive.
   - the use of hashtags, especially ""#sarcasm"" and ""#ithinkhehatesmesomedays"", directly indicates sarcasm and a negative underlying sentiment.
   - the contrast between ""so supportive"" and the actual quote creates irony.

3. the use of ""#sarcasm"" is a clear indicator that the speaker is being sarcastic about the coach's ""supportiveness."" the other hashtags further reinforce this by suggesting a love-hate relationship with the coach.

given these factors, especially the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"", it's clear that this text is intended to be sarcastic.",1

Cause I love going to bed alone every night.. #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""i love going to bed alone every night."" the use of ""love"" suggests enjoyment or appreciation.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention is clearly the opposite. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous statement should be interpreted in the opposite way. this is a common online convention to denote sarcasm or irony.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive statement and the negating hashtag is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is actually expressing dissatisfaction or unhappiness about going to bed alone, but doing so through irony.

therefore, this statement is definitely sarcastic.",1

Kid who tried stealing tools from me is now mad cuz someone took his hot sauce out of the fridge at work #Irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be describing a situation of irony. the use of ""#irony"" at the end explicitly points this out. the tone appears to be one of amusement or satisfaction at the apparent karmic justice.

step 2: true intention
the true intention here is to highlight the ironic situation and perhaps express a sense of poetic justice. the author is drawing a parallel between two theft situations: the kid trying to steal tools from the author, and then someone stealing the kid's hot sauce. the use of ""now mad"" suggests the author finds humor in the kid's reaction to experiencing theft himself.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the tweet uses the hashtag ""#irony"", which might initially seem to negate sarcasm, the overall tone and structure of the tweet actually align with sarcastic expression. the author is using irony to convey a sarcastic attitude towards the situation. the implicit message is something like ""how funny that the thief is upset about being stolen from,"" which is a classic sarcastic observation.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to express a sarcastic viewpoint about the situation, highlighting the hypocrisy of the would-be thief being upset when he becomes a victim of theft himself.",1
EmoPostAhead lol the sucky thing about seeing beauty in everything? You see the beauty in a liar #BeautifulLiar #lovethwayyoulie #NOT,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed:
- positive elements: ""lol"", ""beauty in everything"", ""#beautifulliar""
- negative elements: ""sucky thing"", ""#not""

the conflicting elements make the surface sentiment ambiguous.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper:
- ""lol"" at the beginning suggests mockery rather than genuine amusement
- ""sucky thing about seeing beauty in everything"" implies a criticism of being too optimistic
- ""you see the beauty in a liar"" is pointing out a flaw in always seeing beauty
- ""#beautifulliar"" and ""#lovethwayyoulie"" are likely meant ironically
- ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the seemingly positive statements

the true intention appears to be criticizing naivety or excessive optimism, particularly in relation to liars or deception.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface sentiment contains positive elements, but the true intention is clearly negative and critical. the use of seemingly positive hashtags followed by ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is using irony to emphasize their actual negative feelings about the situation.

This team would finish fourth. #Irony #Arsenal #Afc,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the statement ""this team would finish fourth"" doesn't inherently contain negative words or phrases. it's a straightforward prediction about a team's performance.

step 2: true intention
several clues suggest this statement isn't meant to be taken at face value:
1. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly indicates the statement is not meant literally.
2. ""#arsenal #afc"" suggests this is about the arsenal football club.
3. for a top club like arsenal, finishing fourth might be considered disappointing, not praiseworthy.
4. the use of ""would"" instead of ""will"" hints at a hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement seems neutral or even positive (finishing fourth isn't bad for many teams), the true intention appears to be mocking or criticizing arsenal's performance. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms that the statement is meant sarcastically. the author is likely implying that arsenal's performance is so poor that even finishing fourth would be unrealistic or ironic to suggest.

@KateOnTheGo Things also go slowly when you are waiting for them especially!,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. the statement is making an observation about how time seems to pass slowly when waiting for something, which is a common experience many people can relate to.

step 2: upon closer examination, this sentence is likely conveying a sense of frustration or irony. the phrase ""especially"" at the end emphasizes the contrast between the desire for things to move quickly and the reality of time seeming to slow down when waiting. this is a common rhetorical device used in sarcastic statements.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the underlying intention, we can see a discrepancy. while the statement appears straightforward on the surface, it's actually expressing frustration through irony. the use of ""especially"" at the end is a key indicator of sarcastic tone, emphasizing the obvious nature of the observation in a way that suggests the speaker finds it annoying or amusing.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

"Few #relations are by #chance, few are by #choice and few are by #Facebook!! #irony",1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat neutral or mildly positive. the tweet talks about relationships being formed by chance, choice, and facebook, which on its own doesn't indicate strong positive or negative emotions.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the inclusion of ""#irony"" at the end. this hashtag signals that the author is being ironic or sarcastic about the statement. the implication is that facebook relationships are not as meaningful or genuine as those formed by chance or choice.

step 3: analysis and final inference
the contrast between the seemingly neutral statement about relationship types and the ""#irony"" tag reveals the sarcastic nature of the tweet. the author is likely critiquing the superficiality of facebook connections by ironically equating them with meaningful relationships formed by chance or choice.

given the clear use of ""#irony"" and the subtle critique of social media relationships, this tweet is definitely sarcastic.",1
what a lovely perma-fall we're having here in milwaukee. #not #doomandgloom #gimmesnow,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""lovely"" - a positive adjective
- ""perma-fall"" - could be seen as a pleasant extended autumn season

step 2: true intention
several clues suggest the true intention is negative:
- ""perma-fall"" - likely means perpetual fall weather, implying frustration with lack of seasonal change
- ""#not"" - explicitly negates the positive statement
- ""#doomandgloom"" - expresses negativity
- ""#gimmesnow"" - indicates desire for winter/snow instead of fall

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention is clearly negative. the use of ""lovely"" contrasted with the negative hashtags creates a clear sarcastic tone. the author is expressing frustration with prolonged fall weather when they desire snow, using sarcasm to emphasize their point.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the author mentions a ""very well cleaned country road,"" which is a positive description. there are no overtly negative words or phrases used.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out irony or sarcasm. the author describes a tow truck, which is meant to help vehicles out of ditches, getting stuck in a ditch itself. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end explicitly indicates that the author finds this situation ironic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral to positive, the true intention is to highlight an ironic situation. the use of ""very well cleaned country road"" contrasts with the tow truck getting stuck, emphasizing the unexpected nature of the event. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms the author's sarcastic intent.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the contrast between the well-maintained road and the tow truck's mishap, coupled with the explicit ""#irony"" tag, clearly indicates a sarcastic tone in this tweet.",1

Mondaiiis to fridaiis without Huweyyyyyy #do #NOT #like http://t.co/eY6n4SeS9M,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key indicators:
- ""without huweyyyyyy"" suggests missing someone
- ""#do #not #like"" explicitly states dislike
- the elongated spellings ""mondaiiis"", ""fridaiis"", and ""huweyyyyyy"" could indicate emotional emphasis

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment:
- the tweet expresses dislike for weekdays without a person named huwey
- the hashtags reinforce the negative sentiment
- the informal, emotive spelling style suggests genuine feeling rather than irony

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and true intention. the tweet straightforwardly expresses dissatisfaction with weekdays spent without a particular person. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony.

You could say after today I'm officially necrophelic #LatinFinal #justajoke #not intodeadthings,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is somewhat ambiguous. the phrase ""you could say after today i'm officially necrophelic"" initially sounds like a straightforward statement. however, the hashtags ""#justajoke"" and ""#not intodeadthings"" provide conflicting signals.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the full context:
1. ""#latinfinal"" suggests this is related to a latin exam.
2. ""necrophelic"" likely refers to ""necrophilia,"" which is an extreme and taboo topic.
3. ""#justajoke"" explicitly states that this is not meant to be taken seriously.
4. ""#not intodeadthings"" further emphasizes that the speaker is not actually interested in necrophilia.

the true intention appears to be making a joke about how difficult or ""deadly"" the latin final exam was, using hyperbole and dark humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement could be taken literally, the hashtags and context make it clear that this is an exaggerated joke. the speaker is using sarcasm to express how challenging or exhausting the latin final was by jokingly comparing it to death or being interested in dead things.

### label: sarcastic

the use of extreme exaggeration, coupled with the clarifying hashtags, indicates that this is a sarcastic statement meant to humorously comment on the difficulty of a latin exam.",1
Equal justice for all...unless you are Black during the Obama administration. http://t.co/8ELZkTarZZ via @foxnewspolitics,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first with the phrase ""equal justice for all"", which sounds like a noble ideal. however, this is immediately followed by ""unless you are black during the obama administration"", which introduces a negative and contradictory element. the inclusion of a fox news link also suggests a potentially critical stance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement appears to be critical of the obama administration's handling of racial justice issues. by starting with ""equal justice for all"" and then immediately contradicting it, the author is likely trying to point out perceived hypocrisy or failure in achieving equal justice during obama's presidency, specifically for black americans.

step 3: compare and analyze
the contrast between the initial positive statement and the subsequent contradiction creates a clear sarcastic tone. the author is not sincerely promoting the idea of equal justice, but rather using it ironically to criticize what they perceive as unequal treatment. the use of ""..."" followed by ""unless"" is a common structure for delivering sarcastic statements.

### label: sarcastic

the statement employs irony to criticize a perceived lack of equal justice, making it clearly sarcastic in nature.",1
"tried to export an azure vm, well that went ok #sarcasm #vmcorrupt #thankyoumicrosoft #startalloveragain",1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance with phrases like ""that went ok"" and hashtags that seem to express gratitude (#thankyoumicrosoft).

step 2: however, the true intention becomes clear when examining the full context:
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates sarcastic intent.
- ""#vmcorrupt"" suggests the vm export actually failed.
- ""#startalloveragain"" implies frustration and the need to redo work.
- the phrase ""well that went ok"" is likely meant ironically given the other context.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it's clear this tweet is sarcastic. the author is expressing frustration with a failed vm export process by sarcastically claiming it went well and thanking microsoft, while hashtags make the sarcastic intent explicit.

therefore, the correct label is ""sarcastic"".",1

Hardest parking i've probably ever done! #screwyousmallparkinglot,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the superlative ""hardest"" and the exclamation mark, suggesting an achievement or impressive feat.

step 2: true intention
however, the hashtag ""#screwyousmallparkinglot"" reveals frustration and anger towards the parking situation. this contradicts the seemingly positive sentiment of the first part.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the apparently positive statement about difficult parking and the angry hashtag is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is using exaggerated praise to express their actual frustration with the parking situation.

### label: sarcastic

"I guess Paul didn't have buns, hon. #EatenAlive #not @Discovery",1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""i guess"" suggests uncertainty, and ""didn't have buns"" could be interpreted as a mild disappointment or observation. the hashtag ""#not"" might indicate a negative sentiment.

step 2: the true intention of this tweet is likely sarcastic. the context seems to be referring to a show or event called ""eaten alive"" (as indicated by the hashtag), possibly on discovery channel (mentioned in the tweet). the phrase ""didn't have buns, hon"" is a play on words, where ""buns"" could refer to both bread rolls and a colloquial term for buttocks. this wordplay, combined with the ""#not"" hashtag, strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (neutral to slightly negative) with the true intention (sarcastic commentary on an event or show), it's clear that there's a discrepancy. the use of wordplay, the informal tone (""hon""), and the ""#not"" hashtag are strong indicators of sarcasm. the tweet is making light of or mocking something that didn't live up to expectations.

An 'important' call from the council about a form we did 3 months ago is just what I need an hour before we head off to Disneyland. #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""just what i need"" typically indicates something desirable or helpful.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly negative. the context reveals that:
- the call is about a form from 3 months ago, implying it's not truly urgent.
- it's happening right before a trip to disneyland, which is meant to be an exciting, fun time.
- the word 'important' is in quotes, suggesting skepticism about its actual importance.
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating the apparent positive sentiment.

step 3: the contrast between the surface positive sentiment (""just what i need"") and the actual negative feeling about the inconvenient timing of the call, along with the explicit ""#not"" tag, clearly indicates sarcasm.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1
Laptop speakers are too quiet for music & simply too loud for porn 😒 !#Irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of ""too quiet"" and ""too loud"" suggesting dissatisfaction
- the frustrated/annoyed emoji 😒
- the exclamation mark indicating emphasis on the frustration
- the hashtag #irony suggesting the statement isn't meant to be taken at face value

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be making a humorous observation about the inadequacy of laptop speakers for different purposes:
- it humorously points out that laptop speakers are unsuitable for both music (too quiet) and porn (too loud)
- the juxtaposition of these two very different uses for laptop speakers creates a comedic effect
- the mention of porn adds an element of taboo or shock humor

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears negative, the true intention seems to be making a humorous, somewhat self-deprecating observation. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken literally. the contrast between the seemingly serious complaint and the absurd situation being described (laptop speakers being simultaneously too quiet and too loud for different purposes) is a classic sarcastic structure.

### label: sarcastic

the combination of the irony hashtag, the humorous juxtaposition, and the overall structure of the statement strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine complaint.",1
@AskPlayStation returning my brand new ps4 thanks to your faulty security. #goodjob #not,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to phrases like ""thanks"" and ""#goodjob"". the use of ""brand new ps4"" also seems to indicate a positive experience at first glance.

step 2: upon closer inspection, the true intention is negative. the user is actually complaining about returning their ps4 due to ""faulty security"". the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous positive sentiment is meant to be interpreted oppositely.

step 3: comparing the surface positive sentiment with the actual negative intention, we can clearly see the use of sarcasm. the user is employing positive language to express a negative experience, which is a classic sarcastic technique. the use of ""#goodjob"" followed by ""#not"" is particularly telling of the sarcastic tone.

Most of us didn't focus in the #ADHD lecture. |.|#irony,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the ironic situation of people with adhd not focusing during a lecture about adhd.
2. the explicit use of the hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet.

these elements strongly suggest the author is making a sarcastic comment about the irony of the situation, rather than making a straightforward statement. the hashtag #irony is particularly decisive in confirming the sarcastic intent.",1
#farage a t1t in public who doesnt agree with seeing t1ts in public #breastfeeding #irony,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as it contains multiple layers:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of insult ""t1t"" (likely meaning ""tit"" as a derogatory term)
- criticism of farage's public stance
- hashtag #irony suggesting a contradictory or unexpected situation

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out hypocrisy:
- the tweet suggests farage is against public breastfeeding (""doesn't agree with seeing t1ts in public"")
- but simultaneously calls him a ""t1t"" who is in public, creating a parallel
- the #irony hashtag reinforces this intended contradiction
- the #breastfeeding hashtag clarifies the context

step 3: analysis and inference
- the tweet is constructed to highlight an apparent contradiction in farage's stance
- the use of ""irony"" explicitly signals the author's intent to point out this inconsistency
- the parallel structure (farage as a ""t1t in public"" vs. ""t1ts in public"" for breastfeeding) is crafted for comic effect
- the overall tone and structure are clearly designed to mock and criticize through clever wordplay

given this analysis, the tweet is using irony and wordplay to make a point, which are hallmarks of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
@SR_Duncan @OreoSpeedwagon_ Ah ok. Well I hope things keep going well with person A x,0,"not sarcastic

this message appears to be a genuine, straightforward expression of well-wishes. there are no indicators of sarcasm or hidden meaning. the use of ""ah ok"" suggests sincere understanding, followed by a genuine hope for things to go well. the inclusion of ""x"" at the end, which is often used as a friendly kiss symbol in text messages, further reinforces the sincerity of the message. the overall tone is supportive and friendly, without any apparent irony or sarcasm.",0
@fbhw great story about the student trying to get the teacher fired!!#sarcasm#moron#storywasstupid,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification because:

1. the tweet uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly, which is a direct indicator of sarcastic intent.

2. the contrast between ""great story"" at the beginning and the negative hashtags ""#moron"" and ""#storywasstupid"" at the end clearly demonstrates sarcasm.

3. the exclamation marks after ""great story"" can be read as exaggerated enthusiasm, which is often a marker of sarcasm when followed by contradictory sentiment.

the use of ""#sarcasm"" alone is a very strong indicator, and combined with the other elements, it leaves little doubt that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
@charleswhite816 @DelbartonHockey I will let @bshatel know - I'm sure he is shaking/quaking in his boots. #not,1,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be serious and somewhat threatening. the phrase ""shaking/quaking in his boots"" typically implies fear or intimidation.

step 2: however, the true intention is revealed by two key elements:
1. the use of ""#not"" at the end of the tweet. in social media, this hashtag is commonly used to indicate that the preceding statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning.
2. the exaggerated language ""shaking/quaking in his boots"" is often used in sarcastic contexts.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (seeming threat or intimidation) with the true intention (mockery or dismissal), it's clear that this tweet is sarcastic. the author is using irony to suggest that @bshatel would not actually be afraid or intimidated at all.

therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1
@ParasiteCoD maybe you should grind the gym man #not #calling #you #fat,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a friendly suggestion to exercise, with hashtags that seem to deny any implication of calling the person fat. the use of ""maybe"" and ""man"" gives a casual, friendly tone.

step 2: true intention
however, several elements suggest this isn't a genuine, friendly suggestion:
1. the use of ""#not #calling #you #fat"" actually draws attention to the implication that the person is fat.
2. the excessive use of hashtags, especially breaking up a phrase, is often used in sarcastic or mocking posts.
3. the suggestion to ""grind the gym"" could be seen as an exaggerated way to say ""work out,"" which adds to the sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears friendly, the true intention seems to be mocking or insulting. the contrast between the seemingly helpful suggestion and the pointed hashtags, along with the exaggerated language, strongly indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
"@OhSoSylvie start with India , I need to be somewhere they don't speak great English so I don't have to say much lol",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat negative or avoidant. key phrases like ""don't speak great english"" and ""don't have to say much"" suggest a desire to avoid communication or interaction. the ""lol"" at the end adds a light-hearted tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker appears to genuinely want to go somewhere where they can avoid speaking much due to a language barrier. the ""lol"" (laugh out loud) suggests they find this desire amusing or slightly embarrassing, but it doesn't contradict the main sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's desire to travel somewhere where they can minimize communication due to language differences. the humor is self-deprecating rather than sarcastic.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement doesn't employ irony or say the opposite of what is meant, which are key components of sarcasm. instead, it's a direct expression of the speaker's preferences, albeit with a touch of self-aware humor.",0
"I'm officially making today ""Single men get a smoothie"" day because that's who my customers have been all day.",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the speaker is ""officially"" declaring a special day, which typically has positive connotations. the mention of smoothies also generally carries a positive association.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be expressing a bemused or slightly frustrated observation about the customer demographic for the day. the speaker is not actually creating an official day, but rather making a wry comment about the unexpected pattern of customers they've encountered.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is somewhat positive with the idea of creating a special day, the true intention appears to be making a humorous observation about an unexpected situation. the contrast between the ""official"" declaration and the mundane reality of who's been buying smoothies creates a subtle irony.

given this analysis, i believe this statement contains a mild form of sarcasm. the speaker is using the format of declaring an official day to humorously comment on an unexpected pattern they've noticed, rather than genuinely creating a celebration.

My favorite thing is waking up at 4 and driving 20 minutes in the snow just to see this bitch ass #Not #PaneraProTeam http://t.co/qebtDSVoRT,1,"i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""favorite thing"" normally indicate positivity, but it's followed by a series of inconveniences:
- waking up at 4 (very early)
- driving 20 minutes in the snow (difficult conditions)
- ""just to see this bitch ass"" (strongly negative phrase)
the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#paneraproteam"" also hint at negativity.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration and dissatisfaction. the author is using exaggeration and contrast to emphasize how unpleasant the experience is. the phrase ""my favorite thing"" is clearly not meant literally given the context.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (seemingly positive start, then very negative) contrasts sharply with the true intention (entirely negative). the use of ""my favorite thing"" to describe a series of inconveniences and frustrations is a classic sarcastic technique. the hashtag ""#not"" further confirms the sarcastic intent.

### label: sarcastic

the stark contrast between the opening phrase and the rest of the content, combined with the exaggerated negative description and confirming hashtags, strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic statement.",1
"#Irony: ""The elections are not over zero VAT, but about whether there will be a Zionist or extremist country here"". http://t.co/SxRoXLVspP",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the text discusses elections and presents two contrasting options: ""zionist or extremist country"". the use of ""extremist"" has a negative connotation. the phrase ""not over zero vat"" suggests the elections are about more significant issues.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking the way the elections are being framed. by presenting a stark contrast between ""zionist"" and ""extremist"", the speaker appears to be oversimplifying and potentially ridiculing the electoral debate. the mention of ""zero vat"" (likely referring to a policy issue) being dismissed in favor of this binary choice further emphasizes this point.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text presents a seemingly straightforward statement about the elections, the oversimplification and stark contrast suggest an underlying criticism. the speaker appears to be using irony to highlight the perceived absurdity of reducing complex political issues to a simple binary choice. this use of irony to criticize or mock is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while the statement appears straightforward on the surface, it uses irony to criticize the framing of the electoral debate, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1
Katie pisses me off so bad #TheApprentice,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of negative sentiment towards katie, likely referring to a contestant or personality on the tv show ""the apprentice."" the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm or irony. the hashtag #theapprentice provides context for the comment but doesn't alter its apparent sincerity. therefore, i believe this tweet is not sarcastic.",0
K. Michelle said Lil Kim is Plastic but 65% of her body is fake and silicone. Kim went Plat on PayPal but K has never SEEN platinum. #Irony,1,"i will think through this step-by-step as it contains multiple layers that require careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and negative. it points out contradictions in k. michelle's statements about lil kim, highlighting that k. michelle herself has had cosmetic procedures and hasn't achieved the same level of success as lil kim. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a direct indicator of sarcasm or contradiction.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to call out k. michelle's hypocrisy and defend lil kim. by pointing out that k. michelle is criticizing lil kim for something she herself has done (and to a greater extent), the author is undermining k. michelle's criticism. the comparison of their success levels (platinum status) further serves to elevate lil kim over k. michelle.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is critical of both artists, the true intention is to criticize k. michelle specifically and defend lil kim. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly flags the contradictory nature of k. michelle's statements when compared to her own actions and achievements. this deliberate pointing out of contradictions and use of irony is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses irony to highlight the contradiction in k. michelle's criticism of lil kim, making it a clear example of sarcasm.",1
Rest in peace riff God! #Dimebag #Darrell #is #not #dead #pantera,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this case is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and respectful. ""rest in peace"" is a common phrase used to honor the deceased, and ""riff god"" seems to be a term of high praise for a guitarist. the exclamation point adds emphasis to this sentiment.

step 2: true intention
however, the hashtags contradict the initial statement. ""#dimebag #darrell #is #not #dead"" directly opposes the ""rest in peace"" sentiment. this contradiction suggests that the true intention is not to mourn, but rather to point out that dimebag darrell (a famous guitarist from the band pantera) is, in fact, not dead.

step 3: analysis and inference
the stark contrast between the initial statement and the hashtags reveals the sarcastic nature of this post. the author is using the common ""rest in peace"" phrase ironically to highlight the fact that dimebag darrell is still alive (or was at the time of this post - it's worth noting that dimebag darrell actually died in 2004, but the post seems to be operating under the assumption that he's alive).

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the post uses irony by stating ""rest in peace"" for someone who is explicitly noted as ""not dead"" in the hashtags, which is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1
@WorldDiaMark @RamiBaron let's #not #forget the #origin of a #diamond in #relation with #humanrights #bigdata,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this tweet is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet uses hashtags like #humanrights and #bigdata, which are typically associated with serious topics. there's no overtly positive or negative sentiment expressed. the use of ""let's not forget"" suggests a tone of reminder or caution.

step 2: true intention
the tweet appears to be drawing attention to the controversial aspects of the diamond industry, particularly its historical connections to human rights violations. by mentioning ""origin"" and ""relation with #humanrights,"" the author seems to be critiquing the ethical issues surrounding diamond production and trade.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying message is critical of the diamond industry. the juxtaposition of ""#diamond"" with ""#humanrights"" and ""#bigdata"" creates an unexpected connection that could be interpreted as mildly sarcastic. however, the overall tone seems more earnest than sarcastic, aiming to raise awareness rather than mock.

### label: not sarcastic

although there's a subtle critique implied, the tweet appears to be a genuine call to consider the ethical implications of diamond consumption rather than a sarcastic statement.",0
John Stockton in a commercial?!! Holy crap! #NBABallot,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited and positive. this is indicated by:
- use of exclamation marks (""?!!"" and ""!"")
- the phrase ""holy crap!"" which often expresses surprise or excitement
- the hashtag ""#nbaballot"" suggesting engagement with basketball content

step 2: true intention
analyzing the true intention:
- john stockton is a well-known former nba player, but not typically associated with commercials
- the surprise expressed seems genuine rather than exaggerated or mocking
- there's no obvious contrast between the statement and any known context that would suggest sarcasm

step 3: comparison and final inference
comparing steps 1 and 2:
- the surface excitement aligns with what appears to be genuine surprise at seeing john stockton in a commercial
- there's no clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention
- the tweet seems to be expressing authentic excitement rather than using sarcasm to convey a different meaning

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of surprise and excitement about seeing john stockton in a commercial, without any clear indicators of sarcasm.",0
I have this weird urge to buy a hamster,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of a sudden desire or impulse. there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the phrase ""weird urge"" suggests genuine self-reflection about an unexpected desire, which is more likely to be sincere than sarcastic. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as not sarcastic.",0
I love it when people try to tell me that Oakland is so much easier than other schools 😡 #not,1,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""i love it when..."" however, this is immediately followed by a contradictory angry face emoji (😡) and the hashtag ""#not"".

step 2: the true intention of this statement is to express frustration or disagreement with people who claim that oakland (presumably referring to a school or university) is easier than other schools. the use of ""i love it when..."" is clearly not meant to be taken literally, especially given the angry emoji and ""#not"" at the end.

step 3: comparing the superficially positive opening with the clearly negative true intention, we can see a stark contrast. this mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning, coupled with the use of the angry emoji and ""#not"" to negate the opening phrase, are clear indicators of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
@robinhosking where did THAT come from?!,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step since the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be one of surprise or confusion. the use of ""that"" in all caps and the ""?!"" punctuation at the end indicates a strong emotional reaction, likely astonishment or bewilderment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be genuine curiosity or surprise. the tweet is addressing someone directly (@robinhosking) and asking about the origin of something unexpected. there's no clear indication of irony or hidden meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the likely true intention, they seem to align. the tweet expresses genuine surprise or confusion without any apparent contradiction or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the emphasis and punctuation reinforce the sincere nature of the question rather than indicating a sarcastic tone.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of surprise or curiosity without any indicators of sarcasm.",0
Somebody has filled my head with snot & used a cheese grater on the back of my throat during the night #unimpressed,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears negative. the text uses unpleasant imagery (""filled my head with snot,"" ""used a cheese grater on the back of my throat"") and includes the hashtag ""#unimpressed,"" which typically indicates dissatisfaction.

step 2: the true intention of this tweet is to express that the person is feeling very sick, likely with a cold or flu. however, instead of stating this directly, they've used exaggerated, vivid imagery to describe their symptoms. the use of the hashtag ""#unimpressed"" at the end adds a touch of dry humor to the description.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that while the surface sentiment is negative, the way it's expressed is deliberately over-the-top and humorous. the person is using sarcasm to describe their illness in a creative and somewhat amusing way, rather than simply stating they feel sick. the use of ""#unimpressed"" at the end further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1

this tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of mixed emotions rather than sarcasm. the user is excited about downloading a new game (advanced warfare) but frustrated that they can't play it immediately due to exams. the use of ""!!"" and the sad face emoticon "":/"" support this interpretation as genuine sentiment rather than sarcastic intent.",0
@JohnPUTCH @CougarTownRally @CourteneyCox @bobclendenin @MrJoshHopkins @IBGomez I am so immensely sad about this.,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward expression of sadness or disappointment, likely in response to news about a tv show (possibly ""cougar town"" given the mentions). the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm or irony. the phrase ""i am so immensely sad about this"" seems to be a genuine expression of emotion rather than an exaggerated statement meant to convey the opposite. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as not sarcastic.",0
@TrevorDickerson but hey we could just kill their kids in a drone strike cause that strategy seems to b working so well and #not,1,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or supportive due to phrases like ""we could just kill their kids"" and ""that strategy seems to b working so well"". the use of ""hey"" also gives a casual, almost cheerful tone initially.

step 2: true intention
however, looking deeper:
- the suggestion of killing kids with drone strikes is clearly not meant to be taken literally.
- the phrase ""seems to b working so well"" is likely meant ironically.
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the entire statement is meant to be understood as the opposite of what it says.
- the context of discussing drone strikes and killing children is inherently dark and negative.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface positive sentiment is completely at odds with the true intention, which is to criticize and express disapproval of drone strikes that harm civilians, especially children. the use of mock enthusiasm and the ""#not"" tag are clear markers of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
"Get on the work bus, driver turns his music on and the first song on is 'another day in paradise' #irony",1,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet describes a mundane, possibly unpleasant situation (getting on a work bus early in the morning) juxtaposed with the song ""another day in paradise"" playing. the song title suggests a positive, idyllic scenario, which contrasts sharply with the reality of a typical workday commute.

the use of ""#irony"" at the end explicitly signals that the author intends this contrast to be understood as ironic or sarcastic. they're pointing out the mismatch between the idealized notion of ""paradise"" and the less-than-paradise-like experience of a work commute.

this deliberate contrast between the surface meaning (suggested by the song title) and the implied reality, combined with the explicit irony hashtag, clearly indicates that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
my brother did this. now I hate my brother even more. |#jk #not #stilljk #fatbro http://t.co/ec8j6cy281,0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""hate my brother even more"" indicate strong negative feelings. this suggests a not sarcastic, genuinely negative statement at first glance.

step 2: true intention
however, several elements suggest the true intention is different:
1. the use of hashtags ""#jk"" (just kidding) and ""#stilljk"" (still just kidding) directly indicates the speaker is not serious.
2. the contradictory nature of ""#not"" sandwiched between two ""just kidding"" tags adds to the playful tone.
3. the affectionate nickname ""fatbro"" suggests a more positive relationship than the ""hate"" implies.
4. the inclusion of a link (likely to an image or video) suggests this is a light-hearted post about something the brother did.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text expresses hatred, the hashtags and context clearly indicate that this is not the true sentiment. the speaker is using exaggeration and playful language to express what is likely mild annoyance or even affection for their brother's actions.

### label: sarcastic

the contradiction between the surface negative sentiment and the playful hashtags, along with the exaggerated language, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic post.",0
"Absolutely no #ALP or @jrobertsonmp fan, but seriously many have done this before him & many will. #Scapegoat #Excuse he was a lame duck",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. it starts with ""absolutely no #alp or @jrobertsonmp fan,"" which seems negative. however, it then says ""but seriously,"" which could indicate a shift to a more genuine sentiment. the use of hashtags like ""#scapegoat"" and ""#excuse"" along with the phrase ""lame duck"" suggest criticism or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be defending @jrobertsonmp (likely a politician) despite not being a fan. the phrase ""many have done this before him & many will"" suggests that the speaker believes the criticized action is common and not uniquely blameworthy. the use of ""#scapegoat"" reinforces this, implying that @jrobertsonmp is being unfairly singled out for criticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the tweet starts with a disclaimer of not being a fan, which could be read as sarcastic, the overall message appears to be a genuine defense of the politician against what the author sees as unfair criticism. the use of hashtags like ""#scapegoat"" and ""#excuse"" are likely meant to categorize the tweet rather than convey sarcasm. the language, while critical, doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or irony.

"Lots of people tweeting pictures from their cars of their snowy commutes to work, whilst saying ""stay safe"" Oh, the #irony!",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this assessment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet points out the irony of people advising others to ""stay safe"" while simultaneously engaging in potentially unsafe behavior (taking pictures while driving in snowy conditions). the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the author is highlighting this contradiction sarcastically. the tone of the message implies criticism of this behavior while using sarcasm to make the point.",1
@TonyRohrs they've spread their positions off with long feeder cattle! #sarcasm,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification due to the following reasons:

1. the tweet ends with the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is an explicit indicator that the author intends the message to be understood as sarcastic.

2. the content of the tweet appears to be using financial jargon in a context that doesn't seem to make obvious sense, which is a common technique in sarcasm.

3. the phrase ""spread their positions off with long feeder cattle"" is likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous or exaggerated way of describing some financial or business strategy.

given these clear indicators, particularly the explicit #sarcasm tag, i can confidently classify this tweet as sarcastic without needing to go through a step-by-step analysis.",1
It's all about Twitter #not a clue,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""it's all about"" often indicates enthusiasm or focus on a topic. there are no clearly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the hashtag ""#not a clue"" at the end changes the meaning significantly. this phrase contradicts the first part of the sentence, suggesting the speaker actually doesn't understand twitter at all. the use of a contradictory hashtag is a common way to express sarcasm on social media.

step 3: analysis and inference
the surface meaning suggests knowledge or focus on twitter, while the hashtag reveals a lack of understanding. this contradiction between the main statement and the hashtag is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely mocking either their own lack of understanding of twitter or perhaps criticizing the complexity or importance placed on the platform.

### label: sarcastic",1
"@ban_postgate though, I suspect you don't actually care about the truth, so whatever, go troll someone else ;-)",0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""i suspect you don't actually care about the truth"" is accusatory and critical. the instruction to ""go troll someone else"" is dismissive and confrontational.

step 2: however, the true intention seems to be more complex. the use of ""though"" at the beginning suggests a contrast with a previous statement. the winky face emoticon "";-)"" at the end typically indicates playfulness or jest, which contradicts the seemingly harsh words.

step 3: comparing the surface negativity with the playful emoticon and the contextual cues, this appears to be a case of sarcasm. the author is using seemingly harsh words but softening them with the emoticon, suggesting they're not entirely serious. the contrast between the accusatory content and the lighthearted delivery is a hallmark of sarcasm.

@KaylaBattaglia thanks I thought it was tomorrow #not #iknow #notthepoint,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to the ""thanks"" at the beginning. however, the hashtags at the end (#not #iknow #notthepoint) introduce a contradictory tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet seems to be expressing frustration or annoyance. the ""thanks"" is likely not genuine, and the hashtags reveal that the speaker actually did know the correct information and is irritated that this wasn't the main issue.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment starts positive with ""thanks,"" the true intention is revealed through the sarcastic use of hashtags. the ""#not"" directly contradicts the thanks, ""#iknow"" suggests the speaker didn't actually need the information, and ""#notthepoint"" implies frustration that the main issue is being missed.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to express frustration, with the surface-level ""thanks"" being contradicted by the revealing hashtags.",1
She talkin bout gender roles and we're the narrow minded ones #Irony,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""we're the narrow minded ones"" could be seen as self-critical, but the inclusion of ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the surface meaning may not be the true intention.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet is to criticize the person who is ""talkin bout gender roles."" the author is implying that the person discussing gender roles is actually the narrow-minded one, not ""we"" (presumably the author and like-minded individuals).

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of self-criticism is contradicted by the true intention of criticizing others. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the statement should not be taken at face value. this contrast between the surface meaning and the true intention, along with the explicit irony hashtag, clearly indicates sarcasm.

therefore, the correct classification for this text is ""sarcastic.""",1
@FleurEast @lilyallen and why wouldn't you be after THAT performance!,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the use of capital letters in ""that performance!"" suggests enthusiasm or excitement. the phrase ""why wouldn't you be"" implies a reason for positivity.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. there's no clear indicator of sarcasm or irony. the tweet appears to be genuinely praising a performance, likely by fleur east or lily allen. the enthusiasm seems sincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the tweet appears to be a straightforward compliment about a performance. there are no contradictory elements or typical sarcastic markers like exaggeration or mock politeness.

### label: not sarcastic

the tweet seems to be a genuine expression of admiration for a performance, without any sarcastic undertones.",0
Yay for cars having a case of the Mondays. #not,1,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""yay"" - an expression of excitement or joy
- ""for cars having a case of the mondays"" - presenting this as if it's something to be happy about

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be negative:
- ""case of the mondays"" is typically a negative phrase, implying a bad or slow start to the week
- ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the preceding statement is meant to be taken opposite to its literal meaning

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""yay"") contrasts sharply with the negative implication of cars having problems (""case of the mondays""). the ""#not"" hashtag confirms that the initial positive exclamation is meant to be interpreted in the opposite way.

this stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention, along with the use of ""#not"", is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

Just woken up after 16 hour night shift to no gas. Looks like microwave meal and cold shower for me today. Woo!|#sarcasm #fml,1,"label: sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at the end with ""woo!"" which typically expresses excitement or joy.

step 2: true intention
however, the content of the message describes a series of unfortunate events:
- waking up after a long night shift
- no gas available
- having to eat a microwave meal
- having to take a cold shower

these are all negative experiences. the ""woo!"" at the end is clearly not genuine excitement, but rather a sarcastic exclamation.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the contrast between the seemingly positive ""woo!"" and the series of negative experiences clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is using fake enthusiasm to highlight how bad their situation is. this is further confirmed by the hashtags #sarcasm and #fml (which typically means ""fuck my life"", expressing frustration).

therefore, this text is definitively sarcastic.",1
Tulisa has really made herself ugly #xfactor,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the use of the word ""ugly"" to describe tulisa. this is a clearly negative descriptor.

step 2: true intention
the phrase ""really made herself"" suggests intentional action, implying tulisa has done something to change her appearance. the hashtag #xfactor indicates this is likely in reference to her appearance on the tv show x factor. 

the statement doesn't employ obvious rhetorical devices or exaggeration that would typically signal sarcasm. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit harsh, criticism of tulisa's appearance.

step 3: comparison and final analysis
the surface sentiment and the likely true intention align in this case. there's no apparent mismatch or irony that would indicate sarcasm. the comment appears to be a direct, negative opinion about tulisa's appearance.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine, albeit unkind, criticism rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
A well known sci communicator is exaggerating the claims of a study into PR exaggerating the claims of scientific studies... #irony,1,"given the context and content of the input text, i'm confident in classifying this as sarcastic. here's my analysis:

### label: sarcastic

the key elements that indicate sarcasm are:

1. the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet. this hashtag is a direct signal that the author is pointing out irony, which is closely related to sarcasm.

2. the content itself describes a situation that is inherently ironic: a science communicator (someone expected to accurately convey scientific information) is exaggerating claims about a study that itself is about exaggeration of scientific claims.

3. the phrase ""well known sci communicator"" suggests a person of authority or respect in the field, which makes their alleged exaggeration more noteworthy and ironic.

4. the structure of the sentence, pointing out this contradiction, is typical of sarcastic commentary on social media.

the author is using sarcasm to criticize or mock the situation, highlighting the irony of a science communicator engaging in the very behavior that the study they're discussing criticizes. this layered irony, combined with the explicit #irony tag, makes it clear that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
"Because #LOGICALLY, that does #NOT #fully #compute. If they wear #LESS #PROTECTION for a ""#DEADLY #VIRUS"" & do #NOT ""#get"" #EBOLA as result?",0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text uses capitalized words like ""logically"", ""not"", ""less protection"", ""deadly virus"", which seem to emphasize certain points. the use of hashtags and quotation marks around certain words also draws attention to them. the surface sentiment appears to be questioning or skeptical about a situation related to protection against a virus.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out an inconsistency or illogical situation. the author is implying that if people wear less protection against a supposedly deadly virus (ebola) and don't get infected, then there's something questionable about the narrative of the virus being deadly or the necessity of protection.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of skepticism aligns with the true intention of pointing out an apparent contradiction. the use of capitalization and hashtags serves to emphasize the perceived absurdity of the situation. the rhetorical question format and the exaggerated use of punctuation and formatting (hashtags, quotation marks) are common techniques used in sarcastic statements to highlight irony or absurdity.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses sarcasm to critique the logic behind virus protection measures, particularly regarding ebola.",1
Last night watch for 2014!! That deserves 💣'r breakfast dram. @Bowmore 17yr from @ADRattrayWhisky #scotch #Islay http://t.co/69ROwqkilU,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine expression of enjoyment and celebration, without any sarcastic undertones. the author is sharing their excitement about their last night watch of 2014 and treating themselves to a special whisky as a reward. the use of positive language, emojis, and hashtags all support a sincere, non-sarcastic tone.",0
can I just own an isle far away from here where my house is stunningly beautiful with only some closed ppl who appreciates me as a human,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sentiment isn't immediately clear:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears wistful or wishful. key phrases like ""can i just own an isle far away"" and ""stunningly beautiful"" suggest a desire for something positive and idyllic. the mention of ""only some closed ppl who appreciates me as a human"" implies a longing for genuine connection and appreciation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing a genuine desire to escape from current circumstances and find a place of beauty, peace, and genuine human connection. there's no obvious irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically signal sarcasm. the language is straightforward and the sentiment appears sincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement comes across as a sincere wish or daydream, rather than a sarcastic comment. there's no evidence of mockery, ridicule, or irony that would typically characterize sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of desire for an idealized situation, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.",0
If only I could be a cooler kid xp lol I'm such a nerd #can #i #know #when #im #not #gonna #get #rejected,0,"to ensure a thorough analysis, i'll think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be self-deprecating and somewhat negative. key phrases like ""if only i could be a cooler kid"" and ""i'm such a nerd"" suggest dissatisfaction with oneself. the ""xp"" and ""lol"" add a lighthearted tone, while the hashtags seem to express a desire for social acceptance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be more complex. the exaggerated self-deprecation, combined with the casual ""xp lol"" and the excessive use of hashtags, suggests that the speaker isn't genuinely upset about being uncool or nerdy. instead, they appear to be mocking the idea of desperately wanting to be cool or accepted.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of self-criticism contrasts with the likely true intention of mocking such attitudes. the exaggerated language, use of internet slang, and the string of hashtags (especially ""#can #i #know #when #im #not #gonna #get #rejected"") all point to a sarcastic tone. the speaker seems to be satirizing people who obsess over their social status or constantly seek validation.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the exaggerated self-deprecation and mock desperation, particularly evident in the use of hashtags, strongly indicate that this statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.",1
@mfouesneau It's so the speaker remembers their talk's over. Otherwise how would they know? #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this assessment, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be providing a straightforward explanation for why speakers need reminders that their talks are over.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear when we consider the absurdity of the statement and the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end. the author is mocking the idea that speakers would need such an obvious reminder.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (a seemingly helpful explanation) with the true intention (mockery of an absurd idea) clearly indicates sarcasm. the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag further confirms this interpretation.

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic"".",1
"Murdered baby, black man in US, kids in Thailand and a woman's body in Avon gorge. It's a jolly day for news today #sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive with phrases like ""it's a jolly day for news today"" and the use of ""jolly,"" which typically implies happiness or cheerfulness.

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly the opposite. the author lists a series of tragic and violent news items (murdered baby, black man killed, kids in danger, woman's body found), which are all extremely negative events. the contrast between these horrific news items and describing the day as ""jolly"" is a clear use of irony.

step 3: the stark contrast between the superficially positive language and the deeply negative content of the news items, along with the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end, makes it unambiguous that this is a sarcastic statement. the author is using sarcasm to highlight how terrible the news is, not actually feeling jolly about it.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic.""",1
the struggle of writing this article and studying for this journalism final is killer.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to words like ""struggle"" and ""killer."" the phrase ""is killer"" typically indicates something is extremely difficult or challenging.

step 2: true intention
in this case, the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the writer appears to be genuinely expressing that writing an article while studying for a journalism final is very difficult. there don't seem to be any obvious rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would indicate sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in agreement. the writer is likely sincerely expressing their struggle with their workload. there's no clear mismatch between what's said and what's meant that would indicate sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

@andygreencre8iv @_BARRYISLAND_ Pulled by White Van Man by the looks of it. Yuk .. so naff. That keeps the magic of xmas alive..#NOT,1,"sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to explain:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears negative. phrases like ""yuk .. so naff"" and ""that keeps the magic of xmas alive..#not"" seem to express disappointment or dislike.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is clearly sarcastic. the phrase ""that keeps the magic of xmas alive"" is immediately followed by ""#not"", which is a common indicator of sarcasm. the author is using irony to express that whatever they're referring to (likely something related to christmas decorations or celebrations) actually ruins the christmas spirit rather than enhancing it.

step 3 (comparison and final inference):
the surface negative sentiment aligns with the true negative intention, but the use of sarcasm is evident. the author employs irony by stating something positive (""keeps the magic of xmas alive"") and then immediately contradicting it with ""#not"". this is a classic sarcastic structure.

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic"".",1
"I'm so sore, work tomorrow is gonna be fun.. #not",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident this is a sarcastic statement, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the statement ""work tomorrow is gonna be fun"" appears positive on the surface due to the use of the word ""fun.""

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate this is actually sarcastic:
1. the statement begins with ""i'm so sore,"" which contradicts the idea that work will be enjoyable.
2. the use of "".."" (ellipsis) suggests a pause or trailing off, often used to imply the opposite of what's being said.
3. most critically, the ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly negating the previous statement.

step 3: final analysis
the surface positive sentiment of ""work tomorrow is gonna be fun"" is completely contradicted by the context and especially the ""#not"" tag. this is a classic sarcastic structure where someone says something positive but means the opposite.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic.""",1
"@pembertonx just lost a fiver already on the early kick off, cheers Forrest :)",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the use of "":)"" smiley emoji at the end
- the phrase ""cheers forrest"" which typically expresses gratitude

step 2: true intention
however, looking deeper:
- the person mentions losing money (""lost a fiver"")
- ""cheers"" is likely used sarcastically here, as losing money is not typically something to be thankful for
- the smiley face is probably used ironically to emphasize frustration rather than genuine happiness

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface positivity (thanking someone and using a smiley) contrasts sharply with the negative reality of losing money. this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is using fake cheerfulness to emphasize their disappointment or frustration at losing a bet.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1
So glad I'm off work tonite🙋,0,"### label: not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the input ""so glad i'm off work tonite🙋"" appears to be a genuine expression of happiness or relief about not having to work that night. the use of ""so glad"" is a clear positive sentiment, and the raised hand emoji (🙋) typically indicates enthusiasm or volunteering, which aligns with the positive sentiment.

there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or other indicators of sarcasm in this short statement. the language is straightforward and the emotion seems sincere. the informal spelling of ""tonite"" is casual but doesn't suggest sarcasm.

therefore, i conclude that this statement is likely not sarcastic, but rather a sincere expression of being happy about having the night off work.",0
Lol my mom can't text and talk at the same time 😆,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be amused or lighthearted. this is indicated by:
- ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the beginning
- the laughing emoji 😆 at the end
- the seemingly humorous observation about the mother's inability to multitask

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker appears to be genuinely amused by their mother's difficulty in texting and talking simultaneously. there doesn't seem to be any hidden criticism or mockery beyond the light-hearted observation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there's no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward, humorous observation about a parent's technological limitations. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or a mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning.

Please snow let us get out of dance early,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or hopeful. the use of ""please"" suggests a polite request or wish. the phrase ""let us get out of dance early"" implies a desire for something potentially favorable (leaving an event early).

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is genuinely hoping for snow, likely because it might result in an early dismissal from a dance class or event. there doesn't appear to be any hidden meaning or rhetorical device that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. the speaker is sincerely wishing for snow in hopes of getting out of dance early. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically signal sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward wish for snow to cause an early end to a dance event or class. there's no evidence of sarcasm in this context.",0
Why is there evidence of a stripper in my house yet I see no stripper in my house 😑💔 http://t.co/2KjUs8rotA,0,"sarcastic

while i'm quite confident in this classification, i'll walk through my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confused and slightly negative, indicated by:
- the questioning tone
- the use of the disappointed/frustrated emoji 😑
- the broken heart emoji 💔

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disappointment in a humorous way. the author is likely making a joke about expecting or hoping to find a stripper in their house, but not actually seeing one.

step 3: analysis and final label
the disconnect between the expectation (evidence of a stripper) and reality (no stripper present) is the key to the sarcasm here. the author is using exaggeration and absurdity to create humor. the emojis further emphasize the mock disappointment, adding to the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i maintain high confidence in classifying this as ""sarcastic.""",1
Beach hangs with my bffz http://t.co/o8WR5zO2lg,0,"not sarcastic

How can u miss something u never had?||#randomthoughts #miss #irony |http://t.co/G5jLy9IKqn,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the question ""how can u miss something u never had?"" doesn't contain overtly positive or negative words, but it implies a sense of impossibility or futility.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out an irony or contradiction. the hashtag #irony is explicitly used, suggesting that the author is aware of and highlighting a paradoxical situation. the question itself presents a logical contradiction - missing something you've never possessed.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention is to highlight an ironic or contradictory situation. the use of #irony and the nature of the question itself strongly suggest that this is meant to be taken as a sarcastic or ironic statement rather than a genuine question.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of #irony, the contradictory nature of the statement, and the overall tone strongly indicate that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
"#Mahathir, one of the godfathers of Asian values, Malaysians are ""stupid"", don't know how to run an airline #irony http://t.co/KzR6aAtrBo",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases like ""stupid"" and ""don't know how to run an airline"" express criticism and negativity towards malaysians. the mention of ""godfathers of asian values"" for mahathir seems positive but is juxtaposed with the negative comments.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing mahathir's statement rather than agreeing with it. the use of quotation marks around ""stupid"" suggests the author is quoting mahathir's words, not endorsing them. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end is a clear indicator that the tweet is meant to be understood ironically or sarcastically.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text presents mahathir's negative view of malaysians, the inclusion of ""#irony"" reveals that the author's true intention is to highlight the absurdity or inappropriateness of mahathir's statement. the sarcasm lies in presenting mahathir's controversial statement and then explicitly labeling it as ironic, inviting readers to see the contradiction between mahathir's status as a ""godfather of asian values"" and his insulting comments about his own people.

### label: sarcastic

the presence of the ""#irony"" hashtag, combined with the presentation of mahathir's controversial statement, clearly indicates that this tweet is sarcastic.",1

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the user appears to be genuinely trying to help another user navigate some interface (likely a social media platform) and is also attempting to gain a follower in a lighthearted way. the winking emoji suggests playfulness rather than sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the message appears straightforward and sincere, without any indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the playful emoji adds friendliness rather than sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to contradict or correct a statement made by @hollymanthei. the use of ""really"" emphasizes the speaker's belief in the accuracy of their claim. the tone is matter-of-fact rather than emotional or exaggerated.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy that would indicate sarcasm. the statement is straightforward and doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or mock enthusiasm. the speaker seems to be genuinely expressing their belief that whatever @hollymanthei referred to is not commonly said.

@WendyWilliams that's some bullshit that's a complete rip off for those items. And I bet some of u idiots really that's a good sale. #NOT,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment is negative. key phrases like ""bullshit,"" ""complete rip off,"" and ""idiots"" express strong disapproval and criticism.

step 2: the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment, but the tweet employs sarcasm to emphasize the point. the phrase ""and i bet some of u idiots really that's a good sale"" is clearly sarcastic, mocking people who might think it's a good deal. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear marker of sarcasm, explicitly stating that the preceding statement should be interpreted oppositely.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that while the overall sentiment is negative, the tweet uses sarcasm as a rhetorical device to emphasize the criticism. the use of exaggerated language and the explicit sarcasm marker ""#not"" clearly indicate that this tweet is sarcastic.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic.""",1
Do you want to be right? |Or do you want to be happy?,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is somewhat subtle here:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the question format doesn't immediately suggest sarcasm. the words ""right"" and ""happy"" are generally positive concepts.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be presenting a dilemma or contrast between being ""right"" and being ""happy,"" implying that these two states are mutually exclusive. this suggests a deeper, more cynical view that contradicts the seemingly straightforward surface question.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface appears to be a simple either/or question, the implied mutual exclusivity between being right and being happy reveals a sarcastic undertone. the sarcasm lies in the suggestion that one must choose between correctness and happiness, as if they cannot coexist. this subtle contradiction between the surface question and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the question presents a false dichotomy in a way that's meant to provoke thought about the nature of rightness and happiness, using sarcasm to highlight the often complicated relationship between these concepts.",1
"I like to think of myself as a broken down Justin Bieber - my philosophy professor, everyone. #sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. the comparison between the speaker (a philosophy professor) and justin bieber is inherently absurd and unlikely to be meant seriously.

2. the phrase ""broken down justin bieber"" is a self-deprecating comparison that's likely intended humorously rather than literally.

3. the use of ""my philosophy professor, everyone"" at the end reads like a sarcastic introduction, as if presenting something ridiculous.

4. most conclusively, the tweet ends with the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which explicitly labels the content as sarcastic.

given these clear markers, especially the explicit #sarcasm tag, we can confidently classify this as sarcastic.",1

@mhairiduncan8 just trying to confuse you all 😘,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or playful. the use of the kissing emoji (😘) at the end suggests affection or friendliness. the phrase ""just trying to"" also has a casual, light-hearted tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the person is admitting to deliberately causing confusion, but in a playful manner. there's no obvious contrast between the stated intention and the emoji used, which would be a common indicator of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, they appear to be consistent. the person is openly admitting to trying to confuse others, but doing so in a friendly, teasing manner as indicated by the emoji. this doesn't fit the typical pattern of sarcasm, which often involves saying the opposite of what one means or using a mocking tone.

"20 years ago I arrived in CR, happy to leave behind all the malls and rampant materialism of the US. Went xmas shopping in PRG today #irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first, with phrases like ""happy to leave behind"" suggesting contentment with moving away from ""malls and rampant materialism."" however, the tweet ends with ""#irony,"" which is a clear indicator that the true meaning may be different from the surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear when we consider the full context:
1. the author left the us 20 years ago, ostensibly to escape materialism.
2. they went christmas shopping in prg (presumably prague) today.
3. the use of ""#irony"" suggests that their current actions contradict their original intentions.

the true intention is to point out the irony in their situation - they left to escape materialism but are now engaging in the very consumer behavior they once sought to avoid.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment (happiness about leaving materialism behind) directly contradicts the implied true situation (engaging in christmas shopping). the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the author is aware of and pointing out this contradiction.

"again, your myth of ""racist DNA"" is still only a figment of your delusional imagination @RBRNetwork1 @GodlyPghDad @Anan_VII @JoeHilgerman",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet does not appear to be sarcastic. the author is directly and critically addressing another user's idea, calling it a ""myth"" and a ""figment of your delusional imagination."" the language is confrontational and dismissive, but it's expressing the writer's genuine opinion rather than using irony or sarcasm to make a point. the tone is serious and accusatory, consistent with someone earnestly disagreeing with and criticizing another person's views.",0
http://t.co/xJ3EIw6UG4 #NOT SO UGLY CHRISTMAS SWEATER HUNTER'S RUN SANTA'S SLEIGH OVER THE ROOFTOPS http://t.co/RGydbEK0h2,0,"label: not sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning directly:

this tweet appears to be a straightforward product listing or advertisement for a christmas sweater. the phrase ""not so ugly christmas sweater"" suggests that this is meant to be a more attractive or desirable version of the typically ""ugly"" christmas sweaters. the rest of the text describes the design (""hunter's run santa's sleigh over the rooftops""), which seems to be a genuine description of the product.

there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony in this text. the use of capital letters is likely for emphasis or to mimic a product title, rather than to convey sarcasm. the hashtag and included links also suggest this is a genuine product promotion.

therefore, this tweet appears to be a sincere, non-sarcastic product advertisement or description.",0
I know who I am. I am not perfect. I'm not the most beautiful woman in the world. But I'm one of them. #women #not #perfet|-Mary J. Blige,0,"not sarcastic

this quote from mary j. blige appears to be a genuine expression of self-confidence and self-awareness, rather than sarcasm. the statement acknowledges both her imperfections and her positive attributes in a straightforward manner. the hashtags #women and #not #perfet (likely meant to be ""perfect"") reinforce the sincerity of the message about embracing one's flaws while recognizing one's worth. there's no indication of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
@anamyid @i_contemplate_ @left_liberal effigies of jesus or allah..... when she herself hadnt kept any of d hindu gods #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious and requires some context analysis.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. there's mention of religious figures (jesus, allah, hindu gods) and the use of ""#irony"" at the end. the ellipsis (....) may indicate a pause or hesitation in the statement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out inconsistency or hypocrisy. the tweet seems to be criticizing someone (likely ""she"" mentioned) for objecting to effigies of jesus or allah while not having kept any hindu gods herself. the use of ""#irony"" at the end reinforces this interpretation.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment doesn't immediately reveal sarcasm, but the underlying message does. the author is using irony to highlight what they perceive as hypocritical behavior. the hashtag ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author intends this message to be understood as ironic or sarcastic.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the use of irony to point out perceived hypocrisy, combined with the explicit ""#irony"" hashtag, clearly indicates that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1
I have three exams today lets gooooo! #School #Sarcasm #Swag,1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break down my reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the enthusiastic ""lets gooooo!"" and the use of ""#swag"", which typically denotes something cool or positive.

step 2: however, the true intention is likely negative. having three exams in one day is generally considered stressful and undesirable for students. the exaggerated enthusiasm (""lets gooooo!"") is likely meant ironically. moreover, the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" in the hashtags is a clear indicator that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparing the seemingly positive surface sentiment with the likely negative true feelings about having multiple exams, combined with the explicit sarcasm tag, strongly indicates that this is indeed a sarcastic statement.

the presence of ""#sarcasm"" in the text makes this classification particularly straightforward, leaving little room for doubt that the statement is intended to be sarcastic.",1
Today was a very good day in Iceland.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of this sentence is positive. key indicators:
- ""very good day"" is an explicitly positive phrase
- there are no negative words or phrases
- the overall tone seems straightforward and positive

step 2: true intention
there doesn't appear to be any obvious rhetorical devices or unusual language style that would suggest a hidden meaning. the sentence is simple and declarative. there's no context provided that would hint at sarcasm or irony. iceland isn't typically associated with particularly bad weather or conditions that would make this statement likely to be sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the likely true intention align in this case. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meaning. the statement appears to be a straightforward positive comment about having a good day in iceland.

### label: not sarcastic

while it's always possible for sarcasm to exist without additional context, based on the information provided, this statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of having had a good day in iceland.",0
Welll helllo fever. Id say 103 is feelin real good today #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance. the phrase ""feelin real good today"" suggests a positive mood or state.

step 2: however, several clues indicate this is actually sarcastic:
1. the exaggerated greeting ""welll helllo fever"" with extra letters suggests a mocking tone.
2. mentioning a fever of 103 degrees (presumably fahrenheit) is actually quite high and uncomfortable.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly negating the previous statement.

step 3: comparing the surface positive sentiment with the true negative sentiment about having a high fever, along with the explicit sarcasm marker ""#not"", it's clear this statement is sarcastic. the person is actually feeling terrible due to the fever but expressing it through sarcasm.

therefore, the classification is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1
I feel and look like shit. #rainyday #nomakeup #sorrynotsorry http://t.co/xxPU1lb2ki,0,"let's analyze this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to phrases like ""feel and look like shit"" and the hashtag ""#rainyday"". however, there's some ambiguity with the hashtags ""#nomakeup"" and ""#sorrynotsorry"".

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a mix of self-deprecating humor and defiance. the use of ""shit"" is harsh self-criticism, but the ""#sorrynotsorry"" hashtag suggests the speaker isn't actually apologetic about their appearance. ""#nomakeup"" could be interpreted as pride in showing a natural look.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the statement starts negative, the hashtags shift the tone. ""#sorrynotsorry"" is often used sarcastically to express unapologetic behavior or attitudes. the contrast between the negative self-description and the seemingly confident hashtags creates a mildly sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i would classify this as:

### label: sarcastic

the sarcasm is subtle but present in the juxtaposition of the negative self-description with the defiant and unapologetic hashtags, particularly ""#sorrynotsorry"".",1

@StephHammy @ZacapaRum lol.. Old enough to know better... Young enough to do it again,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the phrase ""old enough to know better... young enough to do it again"" is a common lighthearted expression about being at an age where one has experience but still feels youthful enough to engage in potentially unwise but fun activities. the ""lol"" at the beginning reinforces the playful, non-sarcastic tone. the statement is meant to be taken at face value as a humorous comment on the speaker's age and attitude, rather than conveying any hidden or opposite meaning that would indicate sarcasm.",0
Monday morning inspiration! #sarcasm #itstruetho #donttrustnobody #iwokeuplikethis... http://t.co/DQeFbx80v5,1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly labeled as sarcastic by the author through the use of the hashtag #sarcasm. the presence of this explicit indicator makes the classification straightforward and highly reliable. the content about ""monday morning inspiration"" is meant to be interpreted ironically, given the sarcastic context and additional hashtags like #donttrustnobody which further reinforce the cynical tone.",1
"My mom is the most annoying person I know. I know you're gonna read this since you creep my account, s/o to my mom #idc#istillloveyou",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- ""my mom is the most annoying person i know"" - strong negative statement
- ""#idc"" (i don't care) - typically used to express indifference or negativity

however, there are also positive elements:
- ""#istillloveyou"" - expresses affection
- ""s/o to my mom"" - ""s/o"" typically means ""shout out,"" which is usually positive

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be playful teasing or affectionate criticism:
- the contrast between calling her mom annoying and then saying ""i still love you"" suggests the criticism isn't serious
- acknowledging that her mom reads her account and giving her a ""shout out"" indicates a close, joking relationship
- the hashtags seem to soften the initial harsh statement, implying it's not meant to be taken seriously

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the opening statement is negative, the overall tone and additional context provided by the hashtags and ""shout out"" suggest that this is a lighthearted, teasing message rather than genuine criticism. the contrast between the initial negative statement and the affectionate ending creates a sarcastic or ironic tone.

### label: sarcastic

the message uses sarcasm to express a complex, but ultimately affectionate, relationship between the writer and their mother.",1
@MoAnsar @LouiseMensch Talking to yourself again Mo #Irony,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this tweet isn't immediately obvious without context.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""talking to yourself again"" could be seen as a mild criticism or teasing. the hashtag #irony suggests that something ironic is being pointed out.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be calling out or mocking the user @moansar. by suggesting they're ""talking to themselves,"" the author implies that @moansar is engaging in a one-sided conversation or perhaps responding to their own tweets. the use of ""#irony"" reinforces that the author finds this behavior contradictory or amusing in some way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively mild, the true intention seems to be to criticize or make fun of @moansar. the use of ""#irony"" is particularly telling, as it explicitly labels the situation as ironic. this suggests that the author is using a form of verbal irony to make their point, which is a common element of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe this tweet is indeed sarcastic. the author is using a seemingly innocuous observation (""talking to yourself"") combined with the irony hashtag to deliver a mocking or critical message.

### label: sarcastic",1
"@Latinos4PP @CecileRichards @HHSLatino @CuidadoDeSalud @LULAC @EnrollAmerica #irony #oxymoron ""planned parenthood"" nothing abt parenting",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of hashtags #irony and #oxymoron
- putting ""planned parenthood"" in quotes, suggesting skepticism
- the phrase ""nothing abt parenting"" implies criticism

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing planned parenthood:
- the hashtags #irony and #oxymoron indicate the author finds the organization's name contradictory
- placing ""planned parenthood"" in quotes suggests the author doesn't believe it's an accurate name
- ""nothing abt parenting"" directly states the author's belief that the organization doesn't actually help with parenting

step 3: analysis and inference
comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that:
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention (both are critical)
- however, the use of #irony and #oxymoron, along with the quotation marks, suggest the author is using sarcasm to make their point
- the tweet is using sarcasm to criticize planned parenthood by pointing out what the author sees as a contradiction in its name and purpose

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
Who said that birthday girl can't celebrate the next day??? ☺️☺️ #celebrating #always #nighout #birthdaygirl... http://t.co/P5Ex0ONecU,0,"not sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the text appears to be a genuinely positive and celebratory statement about continuing birthday festivities beyond the actual birthday. the use of positive emojis (☺️☺️), celebratory hashtags (#celebrating, #birthdaygirl), and the overall enthusiastic tone indicate that the speaker is sincerely happy about the extended celebration. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in this message.",0
"@Arlo2121 yep, overall it was a great show live. ending of the TLC match was fubar, and the stairs match was terrrible.",0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine opinion about a live show, likely a wrestling event. the user expresses mixed feelings, praising the overall show while criticizing specific parts. there's no apparent contradiction between the surface sentiment and the intended meaning, which is typical in sarcastic statements. the language is straightforward and doesn't employ rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm. therefore, i'm confident in classifying this as not sarcastic.",0
Video: #im#not#the#only#one#you#think#im#crazy# ahhhhhh http://t.co/uzznJHKepA,0,"step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat negative or anxious. the use of ""ahhhhh"" suggests a cry or exclamation, potentially of frustration or distress. the hashtag ""#im#not#the#only#one#you#think#im#crazy#"" implies that others perceive the speaker as ""crazy,"" which is generally not a positive characterization.

step 2: the true intention of this tweet seems to be sharing a video or image (as indicated by the http://t.co/ link) that relates to the sentiment expressed in the hashtag. the speaker appears to be acknowledging that they are perceived as ""crazy"" by multiple people, but the tone doesn't seem overtly sarcastic. instead, it seems more like a self-aware or perhaps slightly defiant statement.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the tweet doesn't show clear signs of irony or saying the opposite of what is meant, which are common indicators of sarcasm. the speaker seems to be genuinely expressing a feeling or situation, rather than using sarcasm to make a point.

given this analysis, i can conclude with a high degree of confidence:

label: not sarcastic",0
Trying to eat crackers on the quiet floor likeee.. Maybe if I chew slower no one will notice..#not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet is clearly sarcastic due to several indicators:

1. the exaggerated description of trying to eat quietly (""trying to eat crackers on the quiet floor likeee.."") already suggests a humorous tone.

2. the follow-up thought (""maybe if i chew slower no one will notice.."") is an absurd suggestion, as eating crackers slowly doesn't actually make them quieter.

3. most importantly, the ""#not"" at the end is a clear sarcasm marker. in social media, adding ""#not"" after a statement is a common way to indicate that the preceding statement should be interpreted sarcastically or ironically.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic comment about the futility of trying to eat noisy food quietly in a silent area, with the author likely poking fun at themselves or others who attempt this.",1
"Woke up with my foot the size of a balloon, that's just what I needed.. #not #ouch",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. key phrases:
- ""foot the size of a balloon"" suggests pain or injury
- ""that's just what i needed"" typically expresses frustration
- ""#ouch"" reinforces the idea of pain

step 2: true intention
the true intention is indeed negative, but expressed sarcastically:
- ""that's just what i needed"" is a common sarcastic phrase used to express that something is exactly what one didn't need
- the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly stating that the previous statement should be interpreted oppositely

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention both convey negativity, but the manner of expression is sarcastic. the use of ""#not"" and the sarcastic phrase ""that's just what i needed"" clearly indicate that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their frustration with the situation.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as:

### label: sarcastic",1
#Celtics RT @ShannonMoorer: And then there were none http://t.co/UV8jQ7OEd1,0,"for this input, i'll choose to output the result directly as i believe my judgment is reliable in this case.

### label: not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward retweet (rt) of another user's post about the celtics basketball team. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm in the content. the phrase ""and then there were none"" likely refers to some event or development related to the celtics, but without more context, it's impossible to interpret this as sarcastic. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/uv8jq7oed1) suggests it's probably sharing factual information or news. therefore, i classify this as not sarcastic.",0

this tweet appears to be a straightforward sharing of an image link, likely related to feelings or emotions, without any obvious sarcastic elements. the hashtags and content don't suggest any irony or hidden meaning that would indicate sarcasm. it seems to be a simple social media post sharing visual content, so i'm confident in classifying it as ""not sarcastic.""",0

@coreybking thanks for the spoiler!!!! #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the use of ""thanks"" which typically expresses gratitude
- multiple exclamation marks (!!!!), often used to show enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
- the use of ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to indicate sarcasm on social media
- ""spoiler"" is generally considered negative, as most people don't like having things spoiled for them
- the excessive exclamation marks may be exaggerating the thanks, hinting at insincerity

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""thanks"" with enthusiasm) contrasts sharply with the likely true negative sentiment (annoyance at having something spoiled). the ""#not"" tag explicitly marks this as not sincere. this stark contrast between apparent meaning and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

therefore, the tweet is clearly sarcastic, using a seemingly thankful message to express annoyance at having something spoiled.",1
Congress just screwed us but it's a great day in the District because we got another stadium! #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly marked as sarcastic with the hashtag #sarcasm at the end, making it unambiguous. the content also displays classic sarcastic elements:

1. it juxtaposes a negative event (""congress just screwed us"") with an overly enthusiastic positive reaction (""it's a great day"").

2. it implies that getting a new stadium is more important than the negative actions of congress, which is likely not the author's true sentiment.

3. the exclamation mark adds to the exaggerated enthusiasm, further highlighting the sarcastic tone.

given these factors, especially the explicit #sarcasm tag, we can confidently classify this as sarcastic without needing to break down the analysis step by step.",1
#AdvancedWarfare is so much better than any FPS released in 2014 XD,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""so much better than any fps released in 2014"" - strongly positive comparison
- ""xd"" - an emoticon typically used to express laughter or extreme amusement

step 2: true intention
several factors suggest this may not be the true intention:
- the use of ""xd"" at the end often indicates exaggeration or insincerity in online communication
- the absolute nature of the claim (""so much better than any fps"") is suspiciously hyperbolic
- advanced warfare, while generally well-received, wasn't universally considered the best fps of 2014

step 3: analysis and inference
the exaggerated positive sentiment combined with the ""xd"" emoticon strongly suggests that the speaker is not being sincere. the statement appears to be mocking or criticizing advanced warfare by sarcastically claiming it's far superior to all other fps games.

### label: sarcastic",1

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of appreciation for small details or gestures. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the text. the sentiment expressed aligns with a common and sincere human experience of finding attraction or joy in minor aspects of life or relationships. therefore, i am confident in classifying this as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"@ManUtdstholder @hunts9 You're #not familiar #with Matt Busby, #then. Lol.",0,"let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the use of ""lol"" at the end suggests amusement. there are no overtly negative or positive words.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be mocking or criticizing the person being addressed. the phrase ""you're #not familiar #with matt busby, #then"" suggests that the speaker believes the other person should be familiar with matt busby (a famous manchester united manager). the ""lol"" at the end reinforces this, implying that the speaker finds it laughable or ridiculous that the other person isn't familiar with such a well-known figure in football history.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (neutral to slightly amused) conflicts with the true intention (mocking or critical). the use of hashtags for emphasis and the ""lol"" at the end are typical markers of online sarcasm. the statement is phrased as if it's just an observation, but it's actually a criticism disguised as a casual remark.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
Highly inflamed stomach is just what I like #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""just what i like,"" which typically indicates enjoyment or preference.

step 2: true intention
however, there are two key indicators that the true intention is different:
1. ""highly inflamed stomach"" is not something people typically enjoy or want.
2. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to negate the preceding statement, indicating sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""just what i like"") sharply contrasts with the obviously undesirable condition of an inflamed stomach. the ""#not"" hashtag confirms that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying.

### label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. the speaker is using irony to express their displeasure with having an inflamed stomach by sarcastically claiming to like it and then explicitly negating that claim with ""#not"".",1

almost 72 hs of a kid asking for his christmas gift and zero answers from @AskPlayStation thank you guys! you are awesome #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""thank you guys!""
- ""you are awesome""
- the use of an exclamation mark

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
- mentioning ""72 hs of a kid asking"" and ""zero answers"" suggests frustration
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the preceding statement is meant sarcastically
- the overall tone implies disappointment with @askplaystation's lack of response

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""thank you"", ""awesome"") starkly contrasts with the underlying negative experience described. the use of ""#not"" confirms that the writer is using sarcasm to express their dissatisfaction.

### label: sarcastic

the clear use of sarcasm to express frustration makes this tweet definitively sarcastic.",1
... Can#do#no#more#not#usually#a#quitter#only#so#much#can#be#thrown#at#me!,0,"to analyze this input properly, i'll need to think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the text uses phrases like ""can do no more"" and ""not usually a quitter"" which on the surface suggest a sense of resignation or giving up. the phrase ""only so much can be thrown at me"" implies being overwhelmed. the overall surface sentiment seems negative or defeated.

step 2: true intention:
the unusual formatting with hashtags between each word makes it difficult to read naturally, which could be intentional to emphasize frustration. the statement ""not usually a quitter"" followed by an explanation of reaching a limit suggests the speaker is actually emphasizing their resilience up to this point. the exclamation mark at the end adds emphasis, potentially indicating strong emotion.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention doesn't seem to contradict this. the speaker appears to be genuinely expressing frustration and a sense of being at their limit. the unusual formatting and strong emotion don't seem to be inverting the meaning, but rather reinforcing it.

given this analysis, i don't detect clear indicators of sarcasm. the message seems to be a straightforward expression of feeling overwhelmed and at one's limit.

### label: not sarcastic",0
@HallieCiera Well maybe if you werent such a noob you would be up talking to me at 2:30 in the morning :P,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or critical due to:
- use of the term ""noob"" which is often derogatory
- implying the person should be awake at 2:30 am to talk

however, there's also a playful element with the "":p"" emoticon at the end.

step 2: true intention
considering the overall tone and context:
- the use of ""well maybe if"" suggests a joking, non-serious tone
- the late time (2:30 am) implies this is likely banter between friends
- the "":p"" emoticon strongly indicates playfulness or teasing
- the comment about being a ""noob"" is likely friendly teasing rather than genuine criticism

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface text could be read as critical, the true intention appears to be friendly teasing or banter. the combination of the playful language, context of late-night conversation, and the tongue-out emoticon all point to this being a joke rather than genuine criticism.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the message is using mock criticism in a playful way, which is a common form of sarcasm among friends.",1
#not insured,0,"### label: not sarcastic

this short phrase ""#not insured"" doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward statement or tag, likely used to describe a situation where someone or something is not covered by insurance. without additional context or any obvious contradictions or exaggerations, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. the use of a hashtag suggests it might be used on social media to categorize or emphasize the uninsured status, but this alone doesn't imply sarcasm.",0
Horray to working all weekend! #sarcasm #ohwell 💰💰👍😏,1,"sarcastic

this input is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of ""horray"" (likely meant to be ""hooray"") in conjunction with ""working all weekend"" - most people don't genuinely celebrate working on weekends.

2. the explicit hashtag ""#sarcasm"" which directly labels the statement as sarcastic.

3. the combination of emojis that suggest a mix of emotions: money bags (💰💰) implying work for pay, but paired with a smirking face (😏) which often indicates irony or sarcasm.

4. the hashtag ""#ohwell"" further emphasizes a resigned or ironic attitude towards the situation.

the surface enthusiasm is clearly at odds with the true sentiment of dissatisfaction about working over the weekend, making this a textbook example of sarcasm.",1
@chantalireland thankfully not full cold.. Just one side down. Getting the full vitamin netty pot combo blast now,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward response to someone about a health condition, likely a cold or sinus issue. the language used doesn't indicate any sarcastic intent. the person is describing their symptoms and treatment in a matter-of-fact way, mentioning that only one side is affected and that they're using a neti pot and vitamins to treat it. the tone is casual and informative, without any apparent irony or sarcasm.",0

"I do hope you Anti #GamerGate'rs will sleep better, knowing that sabotaging charities would make you more respectable in society. #sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive, with phrases like ""i do hope"" and ""sleep better"" and ""more respectable in society.""

step 2: however, the true intention is clearly negative and critical. the author is actually condemning the actions of ""anti #gamergate'rs"" by sarcastically suggesting that sabotaging charities would make them more respectable, which is obviously not true. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly confirms the sarcastic intent.

step 3: the stark contrast between the superficially positive language and the clearly negative true meaning, along with the explicit #sarcasm tag, makes this a clear case of sarcasm.

therefore, the label is definitively ""sarcastic"".",1
Haha guess my tweet was ok then. Are you back in training @charliejnwalker,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this tweet isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral:
- ""haha"" indicates laughter or amusement
- ""guess my tweet was ok then"" seems positive
- the question ""are you back in training"" is neutral

step 2: true intention
the true intention is a bit ambiguous, but there are some potential hints of sarcasm:
- ""haha"" could be genuine laughter or a sarcastic chuckle
- ""guess my tweet was ok then"" could be sincere, or it could be a sarcastic comment implying the tweet wasn't actually well-received
- the question at the end seems genuine and unrelated to any sarcasm

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there are subtle hints that could indicate sarcasm, they're not strong enough to confidently label this as sarcastic. the overall tone seems more likely to be genuine than sarcastic. the ""haha"" and ""guess my tweet was ok then"" could be interpreted as mild self-deprecation or genuine relief that a tweet was well-received.

given this analysis, i believe the most appropriate label is:

### label: not sarcastic

while there's a slight possibility of sarcasm, the evidence isn't strong enough to confidently label it as such. the tweet appears more likely to be a genuine, lighthearted comment.",0
13 voice mails at work is always lovely #not,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive due to the word ""lovely"" which is typically used to describe something pleasant or enjoyable.

step 2: however, the true intention is negative, as indicated by:
1. the context: 13 voice mails at work is generally considered overwhelming and stressful, not lovely.
2. the use of ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to denote sarcasm on social media.

step 3: the contrast between the surface positive sentiment (""lovely"") and the actual negative situation (excessive voice mails), combined with the explicit sarcasm marker ""#not"", clearly indicates that this statement is sarcastic.

therefore, the correct classification is ""sarcastic"".",1
Sick on Christmas YAYYYY #not,1,"let me think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""yayyyy"" in all caps, which typically expresses excitement or joy
- multiple y's at the end of ""yayyyy"" for emphasis

step 2: true intention
however, looking deeper:
- being ""sick on christmas"" is generally considered negative
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to indicate sarcasm or that the opposite of what was just said is true
- the juxtaposition of being sick (negative) with an exaggerated positive reaction (""yayyyy"") is unnatural

step 3: analysis and inference
the contrast between the negative situation (being sick on christmas) and the exaggerated positive reaction (""yayyyy""), coupled with the ""#not"" hashtag, strongly indicates that this is sarcasm. the author is using irony to express their displeasure at being sick during a holiday that's typically associated with joy and celebration.

### label: sarcastic",1
How were your #holidays? We'd love to hear all about them!,0,"for this input, i believe i can confidently classify it without needing to go through the step-by-step process.

### label: not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine, friendly inquiry about people's holidays. the use of ""we'd love to hear"" and the exclamation mark convey enthusiasm and interest, which is consistent with typical social media engagement from brands or organizations. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm or hidden meanings in this straightforward message.",0
Ah yes. Just what I wanted today- a pounding migraine. #Sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm highly confident this is sarcastic, but i'll break it down to demonstrate why:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance due to phrases like ""ah yes"" and ""just what i wanted,"" which typically express enthusiasm or satisfaction.

step 2: the true intention becomes clear when we consider:
- nobody actually wants a migraine
- the phrase ""just what i wanted"" is often used sarcastically to express the opposite
- the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly labels this as sarcastic

step 3: the surface positive sentiment strongly contrasts with the obviously undesirable experience of a migraine. this mismatch, combined with the explicit sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicates this is a sarcastic statement.

therefore, the label is definitely ""sarcastic"".",1
Munching cheese like its Christmas #stiltonoverload,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or neutral. ""munching cheese"" implies enjoyment, and ""like its christmas"" typically suggests a festive, indulgent mood. the hashtag ""#stiltonoverload"" indicates consuming a lot of stilton cheese.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the person appears to be genuinely enjoying eating a lot of cheese, possibly during the holiday season when indulgence is common. the hashtag ""stiltonoverload"" is likely a playful exaggeration rather than a complaint.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, there doesn't seem to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the language is straightforward and doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggerated praise or mock enthusiasm. the hashtag, while hyperbolic, is consistent with the overall tone of enjoyment.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of enjoying cheese, possibly during a festive period, without any apparent sarcastic undertones.",0
#Hazard worker training. 1st break there was 3 doz donuts and half class outside to smoke. #fail #nomealfitters #irony @MealFit @CrossFit,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. key phrases:
- ""hazard worker training"" - neutral, factual
- ""#fail"" - negative
- ""#nomealfitters"" - potentially negative
- ""#irony"" - suggests sarcasm or criticism

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking the hazard worker training. the author is pointing out contradictions:
- donuts being served at a health/safety training
- half the class going out to smoke during a break in hazard training
the hashtags ""#fail"" and ""#irony"" reinforce this critical view. mentioning @mealfit and @crossfit (fitness-related accounts) further emphasizes the irony of unhealthy behaviors during safety training.

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface sentiment is largely neutral with some negative indicators, but the true intention is clearly critical and mocking. the use of irony to highlight the contradictions between a safety training and unhealthy behaviors is a classic sarcastic technique. the explicit use of ""#irony"" also strongly indicates sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1
The thought of work tonight really kills that Friday feeling.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to phrases like ""really kills"" and ""friday feeling."" the word ""kills"" especially carries a strong negative connotation, suggesting that work is destroying something positive (the friday feeling).

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is expressing genuine disappointment or frustration that they have to work on a friday night, which is typically associated with the start of the weekend and relaxation. the phrase ""friday feeling"" is commonly used to describe the positive emotions associated with the end of the workweek, and the speaker is lamenting its loss due to work.

step 3: comparison and analysis
in this case, the surface sentiment and the true intention appear to be in alignment. the speaker is straightforwardly expressing their disappointment about having to work on a friday night, which negatively impacts their mood. there doesn't seem to be any contradiction between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, nor any exaggeration or irony that would suggest sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of disappointment rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
The thirstiest of thirst buckets calling other people thirsty 😒 #irony,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to explain:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems negative, indicated by:
- the use of the phrase ""thirst buckets"" which is a derogatory term
- the eye-roll emoji 😒 expressing annoyance
- the hashtag #irony explicitly pointing out ironic content

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to point out hypocrisy. the speaker is criticizing someone for calling others ""thirsty"" (overly eager or desperate) when that person is actually the most ""thirsty"" themselves.

step 3: analysis
the surface negativity combined with the pointed out irony clearly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration (""thirstiest of thirst buckets"") and irony to mock the hypocrisy of the situation. the explicit use of #irony further confirms the sarcastic intent.

therefore, this text is clearly sarcastic.",1
@AfterGrogBlog #pantsdowntiggy was his crime. Pixelation #moot or #irony,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the input is not straightforward and requires careful consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is unclear. there are no obvious positive or negative keywords or emojis. the text contains hashtags and mentions that don't immediately convey a clear sentiment. the phrase ""was his crime"" could potentially indicate a negative sentiment, but it's not definitive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet is difficult to determine without more context. however, a few points to consider:
- ""#pantsdowntiggy"" seems to be referring to someone (possibly a nickname) in a compromising or embarrassing situation.
- the mention of ""pixelation"" along with the hashtags ""#moot"" and ""#irony"" suggests there might be some commentary on censorship or the futility of censoring something.
- the structure and cryptic nature of the tweet suggest it might be an inside joke or reference to a specific event or conversation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment (which is neutral to slightly negative) with the likely intention (which seems to be making a point about censorship or commenting on a specific situation), there appears to be a disconnect. the use of hashtags like ""#moot"" and ""#irony"" strongly suggest that the author is pointing out something contradictory or absurd about the situation they're referencing.

given this analysis, i believe there is an element of sarcasm in this tweet. the author seems to be using irony to comment on a situation, likely involving censorship or an attempt to cover up something that's already widely known or seen.

### label: sarcastic

while this classification is not 100% certain due to the cryptic nature of the tweet and lack of context, the presence of irony and the implied commentary on a contradictory situation lean towards a sarcastic interpretation.",1
#notcies #eu Green determined to block Hinkley Point - Green determined to block Hinkley Point Copyright EP 2013.... http://t.co/1koLDjISq3,0,"not sarcastic

i can provide this label directly because the input appears to be a straightforward news headline or social media post about green party members opposing the hinkley point nuclear power project. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, irony, or hidden meaning in this text. it seems to be a factual statement about a political position, likely shared as informational content rather than as a sarcastic comment.",0
I've got a right thirst on... #NewsYearsEve,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this case isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""i've got a right thirst on"" is a colloquial british expression indicating a strong desire for a drink. the hashtag #newsyearseve (likely meant to be #newyearseve) suggests this is related to new year's eve celebrations. the surface sentiment seems positive or excited about drinking.

step 2: true intention
in this case, the true intention seems to align with the surface meaning. the speaker is likely genuinely expressing their desire for a drink on new year's eve, which is a common sentiment for this holiday. there don't appear to be any clear rhetorical devices or hidden meanings.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. there's no obvious contradiction or irony that would indicate sarcasm. the casual, colloquial language style is consistent with a straightforward expression of wanting to drink on a celebratory occasion.

### label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine expression of desire to drink on new year's eve, without any detectable sarcastic undertones.",0
Love the fact that I turned off my alarm this morning and slept till so freaking late #not,1,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""love the fact that"" typically indicates a positive feeling. additionally, the act of sleeping late is often considered enjoyable.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues suggest this is not actually positive:
1. the use of ""so freaking late"" implies frustration rather than enjoyment.
2. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to indicate sarcasm, meaning the opposite of what was just said.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the contrast between the seemingly positive opening (""love the fact"") and the frustrated tone (""so freaking late""), combined with the explicit sarcasm marker ""#not"", clearly indicates that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is actually upset about oversleeping, not happy about it.

therefore, the label is ""sarcastic"".",1
#mcfc trying to kill their opponents.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the use of the phrase ""trying to kill their opponents."" this language suggests violence and aggression, which typically carries a negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
in the context of sports, particularly football (soccer), phrases like ""kill their opponents"" are often used metaphorically to mean ""defeat decisively"" or ""play extremely aggressively."" it's unlikely that this is meant literally. the use of ""#mcfc"" indicates this is about manchester city football club, further confirming the sports context.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment seems negative and violent, the true intention is likely to praise or comment on manchester city's strong performance or aggressive playing style. the exaggeration of ""kill"" for ""defeat strongly"" is a common hyperbole in sports talk. this mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, along with the exaggeration, suggests sarcasm or at least figurative language.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses hyperbole and sports jargon in a way that could be interpreted as sarcastic, especially if manchester city had recently played a particularly dominant game.",1
"#Seen #a #headline #about #a #doctor #that #starts #with #""Doctor #who...""? #Why #not #stick #your #head #in #the #toilet #and #pull #the...",0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a confident classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and irritated. the phrase ""stick your head in the toilet and pull the..."" suggests frustration and annoyance. the excessive use of hashtags also implies a mocking or irritated tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing extreme annoyance at headlines that start with ""doctor who..."" which could be mistaken for referring to the popular tv show rather than an actual medical doctor. the speaker is using hyperbole (suggesting an extreme action) to emphasize how tiresome they find such headlines.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment (irritation) aligns with the true intention (expressing frustration), but the suggestion to ""stick your head in the toilet"" is clearly an exaggeration not meant to be taken literally. this hyperbolic expression, combined with the mocking tone created by overuse of hashtags, strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using over-the-top language to criticize a type of headline they find annoying.

### label: sarcastic",1
"@SusanCalman @ClaireofThorpe Yet no ""dog in the manger"" that actually makes it a dog in a manger story #Irony",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral to slightly negative. the use of ""yet no"" suggests a criticism or disagreement. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end could be indicating sarcasm or irony.

step 2: true intention
the tweet seems to be pointing out an inconsistency or misuse of the phrase ""dog in the manger."" the author is suggesting that for it to actually be a ""dog in the manger"" story, there needs to be a dog in a manger, which is apparently missing from the context they're referring to. the use of ""#irony"" further emphasizes this point.

step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment and true intention align in this case. the author is using a somewhat dry, critical tone to point out what they perceive as an error or misapplication of a phrase. the use of ""#irony"" is likely genuine rather than sarcastic, as they are actually pointing out an ironic situation (using a phrase incorrectly while discussing that very phrase).

given this analysis, i believe this tweet is not sarcastic in itself, but rather pointing out irony.

### label: not sarcastic",0
#Irony http://t.co/yeIqA3NfS1 Reverend tells kids that Santa is not real why declaring a sky fairy is because a book says so. #LOL,1,"### label: sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll walk through the steps to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical or negative. key phrases like ""reverend tells kids that santa is not real"" and the hashtag ""#lol"" (laugh out loud) suggest a mocking tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to point out the irony and hypocrisy of a religious figure (reverend) telling children santa isn't real while promoting belief in a ""sky fairy"" (likely referring to god) based on a book (presumably the bible). the author is using sarcasm to criticize this contradiction.

step 3: analysis and final label
the surface criticism aligns with the true intention, but the use of phrases like ""sky fairy"" and ""#lol"" clearly indicate a sarcastic and mocking tone. the tweet is highlighting the perceived absurdity of the situation through irony and exaggeration.

therefore, the final label is definitely ""sarcastic"". the tweet uses sarcasm to criticize and mock the inconsistency in the reverend's approach to belief systems.",1
"Laborers in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the most productive farming regions in the world, suffer from food insecurity. #irony #poverty",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to negative. the text describes laborers suffering from food insecurity in a highly productive farming region. keywords like ""suffer"" and ""food insecurity"" convey a negative situation. the hashtags #irony and #poverty further emphasize the negative aspects.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is to highlight the irony and injustice of the situation. the author is pointing out the stark contrast between the san joaquin valley being ""one of the most productive farming regions in the world"" and the fact that laborers there are experiencing food insecurity. the use of the #irony hashtag explicitly indicates that the author wants readers to recognize this contradiction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that the author is using irony to make a point about social inequality. the statement itself is factual, but the irony lies in the juxtaposition of abundant food production and worker poverty. the use of hashtags, especially #irony, confirms the sarcastic nature of the comment.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses irony to highlight a socio-economic issue, which is a form of sarcasm in this context.",1
"I think my friend just sent @FrankieBallard a snapchat of me drinkin water, cuz she's fun like that #sarcasm #rehydratewhenyadehydrate #brat",1,"sarcastic

i'll explain my reasoning:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the speaker mentions their friend sending a snapchat of them drinking water, which seems like a mundane, harmless action. the phrase ""cuz she's fun like that"" initially sounds like a compliment.

step 2 (true intention):
however, several clues indicate that the true intention is sarcastic:
1. the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly states that the message is sarcastic.
2. the phrase ""cuz she's fun like that"" is likely meant ironically, implying that the friend is actually not fun for sending such a boring snapchat.
3. the hashtag #brat further suggests that the speaker is annoyed with their friend's action.
4. the exaggerated nature of sending a snapchat of someone simply drinking water implies that it's not actually interesting or ""fun.""

step 3 (comparison and final inference):
while the surface sentiment appears neutral or slightly positive, the true intention is clearly sarcastic. the explicit use of #sarcasm, combined with the ironic tone and additional context clues, strongly indicates that this statement is meant to be taken sarcastically. the speaker is actually expressing annoyance or frustration with their friend's action in a humorous way.

therefore, the correct label is ""sarcastic.""",1
Girls won't answer their phone when I'm calling them bc they think I'm calling them in early but I'm actually calling to cut them #irony,1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to highlight the disconnect between what girls might assume about his calls (that he's calling them early in the morning) versus his actual intention (to end the relationship or ""cut them""). the use of the hashtag #irony at the end explicitly signals the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

the sarcasm comes from subverting expectations - what seems like a complaint about girls not answering calls turns out to be a joke about the author's intention to break up with them. this misdirection and unexpected twist is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.",1
@GMA make sure you don't say Christmas!! The decorate for the holiday. #sarcasm #itisachristmastree,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet is clearly sarcastic, indicated by several factors:

1. the use of the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly labels this as sarcastic.

2. the content itself is mocking the idea of avoiding the word ""christmas"" in favor of more generic ""holiday"" terminology. the exclamation ""make sure you don't say christmas!!"" followed by ""the decorate for the holiday"" is an exaggerated way of pointing out this perceived avoidance.

3. the hashtag #itisachristmastree further emphasizes the sarcastic point by directly stating what the tweet implies is being avoided.

the sarcasm here is aimed at criticizing perceived over-sensitivity or political correctness around using the word ""christmas."" the author is using irony to make their point, saying one thing (don't say christmas) while clearly meaning the opposite.",1
Re: prison book ban - Of course Grayling is also trying to ban Judicial Reviews #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the tweet mentions a ""prison book ban"" and uses the phrase ""of course grayling is also trying to ban judicial reviews"". the use of ""of course"" could indicate expectation or resignation. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end is a direct indicator of potential sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet is to criticize grayling (likely referring to chris grayling, a british politician) for attempting to ban judicial reviews. the author is drawing a parallel between the prison book ban and the attempt to ban judicial reviews, implying that both actions are similarly restrictive or problematic. the use of ""of course"" is likely meant sarcastically, suggesting that this action is typical or expected of grayling, but not in a positive way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment doesn't strongly convey sarcasm, but the true intention does. the key elements that indicate sarcasm are:
1. the use of ""of course,"" which in this context is likely meant ironically.
2. the juxtaposition of banning books in prisons with banning judicial reviews, implying both are equally absurd or unjust.
3. the explicit use of the hashtag ""#irony"", which is a clear indicator that the author intends the tweet to be read as sarcastic or ironic.

given these factors, especially the explicit use of ""#irony"", we can confidently conclude that this tweet is sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic",1
Rolled out of bed for closing.... #ilookreallygood #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses hashtags that clearly indicate sarcasm. ""#ilookreallygood"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is saying they look good, but the ""#not"" contradicts this, implying they actually look bad after just waking up for work. this deliberate contradiction between the surface statement and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1
Watching VT and Cincy - qb for VT with (GODS) down left arm (GIFT) down right arm. - #irony #howmanygods #punctuationmatters,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the text describes someone watching a football game between vt (virginia tech) and cincy (cincinnati). it mentions a quarterback with tattoos on his arms. the hashtags #irony and #howmanygods suggest some form of commentary, but the surface sentiment doesn't immediately indicate sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the description of the tattoos is peculiar: ""(gods)"" on one arm and ""(gift)"" on the other.
- the hashtag #punctuationmatters is key here. it suggests that the placement of punctuation changes the meaning significantly.
- if we remove the parentheses, it would read ""gods gift"", likely meaning ""god's gift"" (with an apostrophe).
- the hashtag #howmanygods further emphasizes this point, questioning the plural form of ""gods"".

the true intention appears to be mocking or criticizing the quarterback's tattoo, which inadvertently suggests multiple gods due to poor punctuation.

step 3: comparison and final inference
while the surface sentiment doesn't immediately scream sarcasm, the true intention revealed through the hashtags and the focus on the punctuation error in the tattoo clearly indicates a sarcastic tone. the author is using irony to point out the unintended meaning created by the tattoo's punctuation.

### label: sarcastic

the text is using subtle sarcasm to comment on the quarterback's tattoo, making it a clear case of sarcastic content.",1
"you seem super smart MT ""@GrannyMarried: @Docjp @JoAnnEileen ||#NO #BLEEDING happening in #WaterBoarding = it's #Not #Torture""",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step as it requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive towards the person being addressed, with phrases like ""you seem super smart"". however, the quoted text contains controversial content about waterboarding and torture, which complicates the overall tone.

step 2: true intention
the ""mt"" likely stands for ""marked text"" or ""modified tweet"", indicating the first part is a comment on the quoted text. the contrast between calling someone ""super smart"" and then quoting a controversial statement about torture suggests the initial compliment is not sincere. the use of quotation marks and the @mentions imply this is part of a contentious discussion.

step 3: analysis and inference
the juxtaposition of ""you seem super smart"" with a quote that argues waterboarding isn't torture (a highly controversial claim) strongly implies sarcasm. the author is likely mocking the quoted person's intelligence by sarcastically calling them ""super smart"" while highlighting what they consider to be an absurd statement.

### label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that the initial compliment is almost certainly not genuine, but rather a sarcastic remark aimed at criticizing the quoted statement and its author.",1
@Nialljenk8 Cheers bro! Top man 🙋,0,"not sarcastic

this message appears to be a genuine expression of gratitude and appreciation. the phrases ""cheers bro!"" and ""top man"" are common informal ways of thanking someone or expressing approval in friendly conversation. the use of the waving hand emoji (🙋) further reinforces a positive, friendly tone. there are no indicators of sarcasm or hidden negative meanings in this short, straightforward message.",0
Even getting cooked breakfast.. Hes defo up to something 😕😮😆😆,0,"let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the sentence starts with ""even getting cooked breakfast.."" which on the surface seems positive.
- the use of ""hes defo up to something"" suggests suspicion or doubt.
- the emojis used (😕😮😆😆) show a mix of confusion, surprise, and laughter.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""hes defo up to something"" implies that getting a cooked breakfast is unusual and might be a sign of hidden motives.
- the contrast between the seemingly positive act (cooking breakfast) and the suspicion it arouses creates an ironic situation.
- the laughing emojis at the end suggest the speaker finds humor in this contradiction.

step 3: analysis and inference
- the juxtaposition of a nice gesture (cooking breakfast) with suspicion creates a humorous contradiction.
- the use of emojis, particularly the laughing ones, reinforces the idea that the speaker is not seriously suspicious but rather joking about the situation.
- the overall tone is lighthearted and playful, using the form of suspicion to humorously comment on an unexpected nice gesture.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses irony to humorously suggest suspicion about a positive act, which is a classic form of sarcasm.",1
"ROFLMAO yeah, OOPS is right @Gumlegs @RBRNetwork1 @blacktalkradio @jumbopaperclips",0,"sarcastic

i'm quite confident in this classification, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive or amused due to the use of ""roflmao"" (rolling on the floor laughing my ass off) and the seemingly agreeable ""yeah"".

step 2: however, the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing. the use of ""oops is right"" in all caps suggests that the speaker is highlighting a mistake or blunder, likely in a mocking tone. the multiple @ mentions imply this is part of a conversation where the speaker is pointing out someone's error to others.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's a clear mismatch between the surface-level amusement (""roflmao"") and the underlying critical tone. this discrepancy is a hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggerated amusement to emphasize the foolishness of whatever mistake was made.

therefore, the final classification is ""sarcastic"". the use of extreme laughter (roflmao) paired with pointing out a mistake (""oops is right"") is a classic sarcastic construct, using overstatement to mock or criticize.",1
Coin ! LeCoinCanard: Coin ! LeCoinCanard: Coin ! have a wank over this hashtag: Fazzanelli: JeffRoylat have a wank over this hashtag #Not...,1,"given the unusual and somewhat nonsensical nature of this tweet, i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is difficult to determine. the repeated ""coin!"" exclamations could be seen as enthusiastic, but the phrase ""have a wank over this hashtag"" is crude and potentially negative or mocking in tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mockery or ridicule. the repetition of ""coin!"" appears to be imitating or making fun of someone or something. the crude suggestion to ""have a wank over this hashtag"" is likely meant to be dismissive or derogatory towards the hashtag or the people using it.

step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface repetition of ""coin!"" with the underlying mocking tone and the crude language, it becomes clear that this tweet is not meant to be taken at face value. the exaggeration and the dismissive attitude towards the hashtag strongly suggest sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the tweet uses exaggeration, mockery, and crude language to convey a sarcastic attitude towards whatever is being discussed or whoever is being addressed.",1
I really want to see Into The Woods!,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a straightforward expression of genuine interest in seeing the movie ""into the woods"". there are no indicators of sarcasm or hidden meanings. the exclamation point emphasizes the speaker's enthusiasm, further supporting that this is a sincere sentiment. without any context suggesting otherwise, this statement can be taken at face value as someone expressing their desire to see a particular film.",0
@JoshuaSinghAIW that bump off the apron looked like it hurt.. was that padding u landed on? #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end of the tweet is a clear and explicit indicator that the author intended the message to be sarcastic. this direct labeling by the author removes any ambiguity about the sarcastic nature of the comment.

the tweet itself uses a seemingly concerned question about padding to imply that the landing looked particularly painful, which is likely an exaggeration or mocking observation given the sarcastic context. the use of sarcasm here is to humorously or critically comment on what was presumably a rough or awkward landing.",1
@GazGShore please make me smile this Xmas.. First Xmas without my mum here. Your my fav everrr. Pleaseeee🎄🎁🎁,0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine, heartfelt request and does not contain any sarcastic elements. the user is sincerely asking a celebrity (gazgshore) for some cheering up during what seems to be a difficult holiday season. the emotional context, use of pleading language, and festive emojis all indicate a sincere sentiment rather than sarcasm.",0
@lawsondath92 Hope the header didn't mess up that barnet,0,"let's approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or concerned. the phrase ""hope the header didn't mess up..."" suggests care or concern for the person's appearance, specifically their ""barnet"" (british slang for hair).

step 2: true intention
in this context, the true intention seems to be playful teasing or light mockery. the mention of a ""header"" (likely referring to a soccer/football move) potentially messing up someone's hair suggests that the speaker is jokingly pointing out a possible consequence of playing the sport.

step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment appears caring, the underlying tone is more likely to be teasing. however, this doesn't quite reach the level of sarcasm. the comment is playful and perhaps slightly mocking, but it doesn't display the hallmark reversal of meaning that's typical of sarcasm. the speaker genuinely might hope the person's hair isn't messed up, even while poking fun at the situation.

### label: not sarcastic

while the comment has elements of teasing, it doesn't fully qualify as sarcasm. it's more of a light-hearted, potentially playful remark rather than a statement where the intended meaning is the opposite of the literal meaning.",0
"If it's NOT? then it IS! Hand Crafted Artistically Fashionable, Connect @the3rdeyebrand for #fashionblog #thoughts http://t.co/s4PBUclKpm",0,"based on the input text, i don't believe this is a clear case of sarcasm. let me break it down step-by-step to explain my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears positive and promotional. it uses enthusiastic language like ""hand crafted artistically fashionable"" and includes hashtags like #fashionblog, suggesting genuine promotion of a fashion brand.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be promoting a fashion brand called ""@the3rdeyebrand"". the exclamatory statements and use of hashtags are common in social media marketing and don't necessarily indicate sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the text is straightforward in its promotional nature and doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or irony.

### label: not sarcastic

It's okay @TicketmasterCA I didn't really want to see my idol anyway. #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be interpreted as sarcasm. additionally, the phrase ""it's okay"" followed by ""i didn't really want to see my idol anyway"" is a common sarcastic structure, where someone claims something is fine when it's actually not. the true intention is to express frustration or disappointment with ticketmaster, likely due to difficulty in obtaining tickets to see a favorite performer.",1
I'll try to guess the ASCII symbols without my admins help. Always trying to learn.,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and earnest. key phrases like ""try to guess,"" ""always trying to learn"" suggest a willingness to put in effort and learn independently.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are a few elements that hint at potential sarcasm:
- ""try to guess the ascii symbols"" implies a task that's typically straightforward with readily available information
- ""without my admins help"" suggests the speaker might normally rely on assistance for simple tasks
- ""always trying to learn"" could be interpreted as an exaggerated or insincere statement in this context

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention seems to be poking fun at the idea of struggling with a simple task or exaggerating one's efforts to learn basic information. the contrast between the seemingly earnest tone and the implication of incompetence or excessive dependence on others for simple tasks points towards sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is sarcastic.

Hearing gun shots when I first wake up makes me feel like I'm in Compton. What a wonderful way to wake up. ?#sarcasm #imscared,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses positive language (""wonderful way to wake up"") to describe a clearly negative situation (hearing gunshots). the contrast between the pleasant wording and the alarming context is a clear indicator of sarcasm. additionally, the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly confirms the sarcastic intent. the emoji ""?"" also often accompanies sarcastic statements online. these elements combined make it unambiguous that this tweet is sarcastic.",1
Protesters upset over decision in chokehold death take the streets again http://t.co/5rxxGu6VV1 /Mexico's streets aren't the only ones taken,0,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly negative. the text reports on protesters taking to the streets due to a decision about a chokehold death, which implies a serious and potentially tense situation. the added comment about mexico's streets suggests a comparison or expansion of the issue.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to draw a parallel between the protests mentioned in the news headline and a situation in mexico. the phrase ""mexico's streets aren't the only ones taken"" implies that there are also protests or unrest in mexico's streets. this addition doesn't appear to be part of the original news headline but rather a commentary on it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the initial part of the text is a straightforward news headline, the added comment about mexico introduces a subtle comparison. this doesn't appear to be overtly sarcastic, as it's not using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. instead, it seems to be making a factual, albeit somewhat wry, observation about similar situations occurring in different places.

given this analysis, i don't detect clear markers of sarcasm. the comment appears to be more of a straightforward, if somewhat pointed, observation rather than a sarcastic statement.

"@classicdrwho247 Great,& not sure if i've seen that actual pic! #not just for girls : D",0,"not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a genuine, positive response without any sarcastic undertones. the user seems excited about seeing a picture they hadn't seen before, and is agreeing that something (likely related to doctor who, given the username mentioned) is not just for girls. the use of ""great"" and the smiley face "": d"" indicate genuine enthusiasm. there's no apparent mismatch between the surface sentiment and the intended meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0
#TGIF oh just kidding I have 30 mins from one job to the next. love 12 hour days. #serverlife #sarcasm #nolife,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident this tweet is sarcastic, but i'll break down my reasoning to be thorough:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive with phrases like ""tgif"" (thank god it's friday), ""love 12 hour days,"" and the use of ""oh just kidding"" which seems to negate any potential negativity.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly negative and frustrated. key indicators:
- ""oh just kidding"" immediately contradicts the positive ""tgif""
- mentioning only having 30 minutes between jobs implies exhaustion
- ""love 12 hour days"" is clearly meant sarcastically given the context
- hashtags #sarcasm and #nolife directly indicate sarcasm and dissatisfaction

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment is completely at odds with the true negative feelings being expressed. the author is using sarcasm to emphasize their frustration with long work hours and lack of free time. the #sarcasm hashtag removes any doubt about the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

given this analysis, the tweet is definitively sarcastic.",1
Just got yelled at by proxy. It's going to be an excellent day. #sarcasm,1,"sarcastic

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet uses irony by stating ""it's going to be an excellent day"" immediately after mentioning getting yelled at, which is typically a negative experience. this juxtaposition of a negative event with an overly positive statement is a clear indicator of sarcasm. additionally, the use of the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly confirms the sarcastic intent of the message.",1
Lol everyday excuse the language #relationships #men #women #irony #lotd http://t.co/XaHt7aPD93,0,"given the content of the tweet, i'll analyze it step-by-step to determine if it's sarcastic:

step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet starts with ""lol"" (laugh out loud), which typically indicates amusement or humor. the phrase ""excuse the language"" suggests that what follows might be crude or offensive. the hashtags #relationships, #men, #women, and #irony provide context and hint at potential sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""lol"" combined with ""excuse the language"" and the hashtag #irony strongly suggests that the tweet is not meant to be taken at face value. the inclusion of #lotd (likely ""look of the day"") with an image link implies that there's visual content accompanying this text, possibly depicting a scenario that contradicts or exaggerates a common relationship dynamic between men and women.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears light and humorous, but the true intention seems to be making a point about relationships, possibly highlighting stereotypes or common conflicts between men and women. the use of ""irony"" as a hashtag is a clear indicator that the message is not meant to be taken literally.

### label: sarcastic

the combination of ""lol,"" the anticipation of potentially offensive content, the explicit mention of irony, and the context of relationships and gender dynamics strongly suggests that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic, likely commenting on or mocking typical relationship situations or stereotypes.",1
Making the most out of my last vacation day. #not #tvandsleep,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""making the most out of my last vacation day"" initially sounds positive, suggesting enjoyment and productivity. however, the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#tvandsleep"" provide contrasting information.

step 2: true intention
the hashtags reveal the true intention behind the statement. ""#not"" directly contradicts the initial positive sentiment, while ""#tvandsleep"" implies that the person is actually spending their last vacation day watching tv and sleeping, which is typically not considered ""making the most"" of a day off.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly positive statement about making the most of a vacation day and the revealing hashtags that show the opposite behavior is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is using irony to humorously point out that they are not, in fact, using their vacation day productively.

### label: sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using irony to contrast the idea of ""making the most"" of a day with the reality of passive activities like watching tv and sleeping.",1
What a lovely day to drive #not #boo #fog #work 😳😳😳 http://t.co/tjJkA1yhq6,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""lovely day"" suggests a positive sentiment. however, this is immediately contradicted by negative hashtags like ""#not"" and ""#boo"", as well as the shocked/concerned emoji 😳 repeated three times. the inclusion of ""#fog"" and ""#work"" also hints at unpleasant conditions.

step 2: true intention
the contrast between ""lovely day"" and the negative hashtags/emojis strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to express that it's actually a terrible day to drive, likely due to fog and having to go to work. the use of ""lovely"" is meant to be interpreted as the opposite of what it literally means.

step 3: analysis and conclusion
the clear mismatch between the positive surface statement and the negative underlying sentiment, reinforced by contradictory hashtags and emojis, is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is not genuinely expressing that it's a lovely day, but rather emphasizing how unpleasant the day actually is through sarcasm.

So restaurants that thrive on the social nature of eating believe that mothers should only breastfeed in private? #irony,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning or critical. the use of ""so"" at the beginning suggests a skeptical tone. the phrase ""believe that mothers should only breastfeed in private"" seems to present a controversial stance. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end is a direct indicator of sarcasm or irony.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this statement is to criticize restaurants that discourage public breastfeeding. the author is pointing out the contradiction between restaurants being social spaces and simultaneously expecting mothers to breastfeed privately. the use of ""thrive on the social nature of eating"" juxtaposed with the expectation of private breastfeeding highlights this inconsistency.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment presents a seemingly straightforward question, but the true intention is to criticize and highlight the absurdity of the situation. the use of irony is evident in presenting the restaurants' stance as logical when it's actually contradictory. the hashtag ""#irony"" confirms the author's sarcastic intent.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses irony to criticize the contradictory expectations placed on breastfeeding mothers in social dining spaces, making it clearly sarcastic.",1
This long drive home later in the snow is gonna be shweeeet #not,1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""shweeeet"" (a slang variation of ""sweet"", typically expressing excitement or approval)
- the use of ""gonna be"" suggesting anticipation

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
- the context of a ""long drive home later in the snow"" is typically undesirable
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating the previous statement
- the exaggerated spelling of ""shweeeet"" could be read as overly dramatic, hinting at insincerity

step 3: comparison and final inference
the surface positive sentiment (""shweeeet"") is clearly contradicted by the ""#not"" hashtag. this deliberate contrast between the seemingly positive statement and the negating hashtag is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is using sarcasm to express their true feelings about an unpleasant situation (long snowy drive).

"#Irony: al jazeera is pro Anti - #GamerGate because feminism, or something: https://t.co/ECxflDl3FD",1,"i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. key phrases:
