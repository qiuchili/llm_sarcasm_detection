@Callisto1947 Can U Help?||More conservatives needed on #TSU + get paid 4 posting stuff like this!||YOU $ can go to http://t.co/JUmMWi0AyT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward recruitment message for a social media platform.
2. there are no obvious indicators of irony or sarcasm in the language used.
3. the message uses typical social media shorthand and promotional language, which is consistent with genuine attempts to attract users.
4. the offer of payment for posting and the call for more conservative voices seem to be presented sincerely.
5. the inclusion of a url for more information supports the idea that this is a genuine request or offer.

while the style is informal and uses internet slang, these elements are common in social media posts and don't inherently indicate sarcasm. the message appears to be a sincere attempt to recruit conservative users to a platform, offering financial incentives for participation.",0
"Just walked in to #Starbucks and asked for a ""tall blonde"" Hahahaha #irony",1,"sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of ""hahahaha"" indicates the author finds something amusing about the situation.

2. the hashtag ""#irony"" is explicitly used, which is a strong indicator that the author intends the statement to be taken as sarcastic or ironic.

3. the humor comes from the double meaning of ""tall blonde"" - in starbucks terminology, it refers to a specific coffee order, but it could also be interpreted as describing a person. the author is playing on this double meaning for comedic effect.

4. the structure of the tweet, presenting a seemingly mundane action (ordering coffee) followed by laughter and the irony hashtag, suggests the author is poking fun at the situation or themselves.

therefore, based on these cues and the overall context, this text is definitively sarcastic.",1
#NOT GONNA WIN http://t.co/Mc9ebqjAqj,0,"based on the given input and the current cues, i believe the label for this text is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of all caps in ""not gonna win"" suggests emphasis or exaggeration, which is often a sign of sarcasm.
2. the hashtag format (#not gonna win) is commonly used on social media for sarcastic or ironic statements.
3. the brevity and informal language style (""gonna"" instead of ""going to"") are often associated with sarcastic comments on social media.
4. the inclusion of a link suggests there might be additional context that contradicts or ironically supports the statement, which is a common sarcastic technique.
5. the apparent pessimism of the statement could be an ironic or sarcastic comment on a situation that might actually have a positive outcome.

while the text is very brief and lacks explicit context, the combination of these elements strongly suggests a sarcastic intent rather than a genuine statement of pessimism.",1
@mickymantell He is exactly that sort of person. Weirdo!,0,"based on the input text and the provided cue, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward, critical comment about someone. the use of ""weirdo!"" at the end is a direct insult, and the overall tone seems to be genuinely disapproving rather than sarcastic. the speaker appears to be agreeing with a previous statement about the person in question and emphasizing their negative opinion. the emotional word ""weirdo"" is used in its literal sense here, not in an ironic or sarcastic way.",0
So much #sarcasm at work mate 10/10 #boring 100% #dead mate full on #shit absolutely #sleeping mate can't handle the #sarcasm,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

5. the cues explicitly mention ""heavily sarcastic"" tone and ""overuse of sarcasm""

all these elements align perfectly with the ""sarcastic"" label.",1
Corny jokes are my absolute favorite,0,"based on the input text and the lack of punctuation cues, i'll provide my judgment:

### label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""corny jokes are my absolute favorite"" is likely to be sarcastic because corny jokes are generally considered to be low-quality or unfunny by most people.
2. the use of ""absolute favorite"" is an exaggeration, which is a common feature of sarcastic statements.
3. while there's no punctuation to provide additional context (like an exclamation mark that might emphasize enthusiasm), the content itself suggests a sarcastic tone.
4. people often use sarcasm to express the opposite of what they actually mean, and in this case, it's more likely that the speaker doesn't genuinely love corny jokes.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the speaker or the surrounding conversation, there's always a possibility that this could be a genuine statement from someone who truly enjoys corny jokes.",1
"People complain about my backround pic and all I feel is like ""hey don't blame me, Albert E might have spoken those words"" #sarcasm #life",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

1. the use of the explicit #sarcasm hashtag, which directly signals the author's intent.
2. the quotation marks around a hypothetical defensive statement, suggesting a mocking tone.
3. the reference to ""albert e"" (likely albert einstein) in a way that implies doubt about the attribution of the quote, further emphasizing the sarcastic nature.
4. the overall informal and colloquial tone, which is often associated with sarcastic comments on social media.

these elements, combined with the language style cues provided, strongly support the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1
"@SR_Duncan @benpobjie Darn, my sock joke needs fixing?",0,"based on the given cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine, casual response to a conversation about a sock joke. the use of ""darn"" expresses mild disappointment, and the question mark indicates sincere uncertainty about whether the joke needs improvement. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions that would typically be present in sarcastic statements. the informal and conversational tone suggests a straightforward interaction rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
"if Christian expects Fifa to sleep in my bed with me tonight, he's wrong 👿",0,"based on the analysis of the rhetorical devices and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a direct, confrontational response to an accusation. the user is emphatically denying that they've ever denied a specific statistic about murders in chicago. the tone is assertive and defensive, but there's no indication of sarcasm. the use of capital letters in ""liar"" and the specific mention of the number of murders (532) suggest the user is being serious and literal in their response, not employing sarcasm.",0

sarcastic

the tweet uses irony explicitly and employs a hypothetical scenario that's unlikely and somewhat absurd (a 77-year-old rapper going viral and popularizing bitcoin), which are classic indicators of sarcasm. the use of hashtags for emphasis (#irony, #bitcoin) and the playful jab at baby boomers further reinforce the sarcastic tone of the message.",1
Pretty excited about how you gave up on me. File Under: #sarcasm,1,"based on the input text and the punctuation cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

@bigedh456 u know that. How u doing??,0,"not sarcastic

this message appears to be a straightforward, friendly greeting without any indications of sarcasm. the casual tone, use of informal language, and the genuine-seeming inquiry about the recipient's well-being all point to a sincere, non-sarcastic communication. the multiple question marks and the casual ""u"" instead of ""you"" are typical of informal online conversation rather than markers of sarcasm in this context.",0

2. the context implies that the speaker is making a point about federal crimes, but in a way that seems exaggerated or ironic.
3. the inclusion of multiple twitter handles suggests this is part of a social media conversation where sarcasm is often employed.

label: sarcastic

the tweet uses the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly, which is a strong indicator of sarcastic intent. additionally, the content of the tweet suggests a situation that the author finds ironic or absurd - a league game being moved due to a cup final, possibly implying that the petrofac cup (a lower-tier competition) is being treated with undue importance. the use of ellipsis (...) also adds to the sarcastic tone. these elements combined strongly point to a sarcastic message.",1

Been at the ER now since 10... #yay #not,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this label are:

1. the use of ellipsis (...) indicates a sense of weariness or frustration with the long wait at the er.

2. the hashtag ""#yay"" is used ironically here. being at the er for a long time is not typically something to be excited about, so this is clearly sarcastic.

@LanceMedow Suhs been clean for 2 years and has only been in the league for five don't act like he was dirty for 10 years#not biased my ass,0,"sarcastic

reasoning:
the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. the use of the hashtag ""#not biased my ass"" is clearly sarcastic. the author is implying that the person they're responding to (lancemedow) is, in fact, biased, despite claims to the contrary.

2. the tone is confrontational and defensive, challenging the other person's perspective in a way that uses exaggeration (""don't act like he was dirty for 10 years"") to make a point.

3. there's an implied contrast between the positive statement of suh being ""clean for 2 years"" and the accusation of bias, which is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

4. the informal language and use of social media conventions (like the @ mention and hashtag) are often associated with sarcastic or ironic communication online.

5. the final phrase ""my ass"" is a colloquial expression often used to express disbelief or sarcasm.

given these factors, particularly the clearly sarcastic hashtag, the text can be confidently labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1
"@StevePulcinella @Coseph05 thank you studs for perfecting and teaching my bench, respectively. Props on form from lifters in AL. #DYEL",0,"based on the available cues and the content of the tweet, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:

the hashtag #dyel (do you even lift?) is commonly used in weightlifting communities and doesn't indicate sarcasm in this context. instead, it's likely used to emphasize the author's involvement in weightlifting culture.

there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggerated language, contradictory statements, or mocking tone. the message is straightforward and consistent with someone expressing genuine thanks for help received in improving their weightlifting technique.",0

3. the juxtaposition of the serious topic (bhopal gas tragedy) with praise (""brilliant job""), which creates irony.
4. the overall negative tone contrasting with the positive phrase ""brilliant job,"" further emphasizing the sarcastic nature.

therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic"".",1
"Pips who drop out of school n have Kirya as 'eir role model tht ey wana sing too..guy spix Portuguese,French,english...#Not a school dropout",0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be criticizing people who drop out of school to emulate kirya (presumably a singer or public figure).
2. there's a contrast between dropping out of school and the fact that kirya speaks multiple languages (portuguese, french, english), which typically requires education.
3. the hashtag ""#not a school dropout"" at the end is likely meant ironically, emphasizing that kirya's success and linguistic abilities are not typical of school dropouts.
4. the informal language and intentional misspellings (e.g., ""pips,"" ""tht,"" ""ey,"" ""wana"") contrast with the mention of multilingual abilities, creating a sarcastic tone.
5. the ellipsis (...) is often used to convey a sarcastic pause or to imply there's more to the story than what's being said.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that the text is using sarcasm to criticize the idea of dropping out of school to pursue a singing career, by pointing out that the role model in question is actually highly educated and skilled.",1

Loooovvveeeeeee when my phone gets wiped -.- #not,1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the exaggerated spelling of ""loooovvveeeeeee"" suggests an insincere or exaggerated sentiment.
2. the context of having one's phone wiped is generally a negative experience, not something one would genuinely ""love.""
3. the emoticon ""-.-"" represents a deadpan or unamused expression, contradicting the supposed positive sentiment.

Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it. -Bill Cosby|#irony,1,"sarcastic

given the context and cues provided, i believe this text is intended to be sarcastic. here's why:

1. the quote itself is presented as inspirational advice, encouraging people to overcome their fears to pursue their desires.

2. however, the attribution to bill cosby is crucial. given the serious sexual assault allegations and subsequent conviction against cosby, using him as a source of moral or inspirational advice carries heavy irony.

3. the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end explicitly signals that the poster intends this to be read ironically or sarcastically.

4. the juxtaposition of an seemingly uplifting quote with the disgraced public figure creates a stark contrast that is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

5. using cosby's words about overcoming fear to get what one wants takes on a very dark meaning in light of the crimes he was accused and convicted of, which adds another layer of grim irony.

therefore, while the quote on its own might be considered inspirational, the context of who said it and the explicit labeling with ""#irony"" strongly indicates that this is meant to be taken sarcastically, likely as a criticism of cosby or as commentary on the fall of his public image.",1

About as relevant as Michael Sam and Jason Collins. RT @eonline: Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott comes out as gay.,0,"based on the input text and the provided context, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

explanation:
the tweet is using sarcasm to comment on the news of dale scott coming out as gay. the phrase ""about as relevant as michael sam and jason collins"" is not meant to be taken literally. instead, it's a sarcastic remark implying that the news about dale scott is not particularly significant or noteworthy.

the sarcasm lies in the fact that michael sam and jason collins were actually quite significant figures when they came out, as they were among the first openly gay athletes in their respective sports. by sarcastically comparing dale scott's coming out to theirs, the tweet is dismissively suggesting that this news isn't important, which is contrary to the actual significance of such an announcement in professional sports.

the use of ""rt"" (retweet) before the @eonline mention further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, as the author is sharing the news while simultaneously commenting on its perceived lack of relevance.",1
Getting Final Jeopardy correct on Kids Jeopardy boosts my self-esteem,0,"sarcastic

the statement ""getting final jeopardy correct on kids jeopardy boosts my self-esteem"" is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. contrast between adult and children's knowledge: the speaker, presumably an adult, is comparing their knowledge to that of children participating in a kids' version of the game show.

2. self-deprecating humor: by suggesting that answering questions meant for children boosts their self-esteem, the speaker is humorously implying that their knowledge or intelligence might not be very impressive in adult contexts.

3. exaggeration: the idea of an adult's self-esteem being significantly impacted by success in a children's game show is an overstatement, typically used for comedic effect in sarcastic statements.

4. implied inadequacy: the statement indirectly suggests that the speaker might struggle with more age-appropriate or challenging trivia, making this ""achievement"" notable enough to affect their self-esteem.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically, poking fun at the speaker's own intelligence or knowledge in a self-deprecating manner.",1

3. the word ""fancy"" in this context adds to the playful, slightly exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.

4. the use of hashtags, particularly #irony, further emphasizes the sarcastic intent.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that the author is making a sarcastic observation about gender, attraction, and the marketing of lingerie models, rather than a straightforward statement of belief.",1

"Since the tribunal was established 14 years ago, no complaint against the intelligence services has ever been upheld. #trustthesystem #not",1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. the key elements that indicate sarcasm are:

1. the statement about the tribunal never upholding a complaint against intelligence services in 14 years is presented in a way that implies this is suspiciously unlikely.

2. the use of hashtags at the end, particularly:
   - ""#trustthesystem"" is used ironically here. given the context, it's suggesting the opposite - that the system is not trustworthy.
   - ""#not"" is a common way to indicate sarcasm, essentially negating the previous statement or hashtag.

the combination of the seemingly improbable statistic (no complaints upheld in 14 years) and the ironic hashtags strongly indicate that the author is being sarcastic about the reliability and fairness of the tribunal system overseeing intelligence services.",1

The most exciting way to start a Friday: a presentation on structurally deficient bridges. #sarcasm #lobbyinglife,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text for the following reasons:

1. the use of the word ""exciting"" to describe a presentation on structurally deficient bridges is likely meant ironically, as such a topic is generally not considered exciting by most people.

2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly included in the text, which is a clear indicator that the author intends the statement to be interpreted as sarcastic.

3. the juxtaposition of ""exciting way to start a friday"" with a presumably dry topic reinforces the sarcastic tone.

4. the keywords extracted, including ""friday,"" ""presentation,"" ""structurally deficient bridges,"" and ""sarcasm,"" all align with the content and intent of the message.

5. the hashtag ""#lobbyinglife"" suggests this might be part of a lobbyist's job, further emphasizing the contrast between the supposedly ""exciting"" nature of the task and the likely reality.

given these clear indicators, particularly the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag, i'm confident in labeling this text as ""sarcastic.""",1
New shirt #new #shirt #im #sorry #its #just #i #literally #do #not #care #at #all http://t.co/4L8inLJg9N,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the main text ""new shirt"" is very brief and straightforward, which contrasts sharply with the long string of hashtags that follow.

2. the hashtags themselves start normally (#new #shirt) but then devolve into a sarcastic message: ""#im #sorry #its #just #i #literally #do #not #care #at #all""

3. this string of hashtags is clearly meant to be read as a sentence expressing complete disinterest or apathy about the new shirt, which contradicts the act of posting about it.

4. the use of ""literally"" in the hashtags is often associated with sarcastic or exaggerated statements.

5. the cues mention that the hashtags are ""largely ironic or dismissive,"" which aligns with the sarcastic interpretation.

the combination of announcing a new shirt while simultaneously expressing strong disinterest through the hashtags creates a clear sarcastic tone, mocking the act of sharing such mundane updates on social media.",1

3. the explicit mention of ""#sarcasm"" in the hashtags is a strong indicator that the tweet itself is meant to be sarcastic.

4. the overly enthusiastic recommendation to follow the account for supposedly hilarious content feels insincere and exaggerated.

5. the combination of extreme praise with self-aware ""addiction"" commentary suggests the author is actually poking fun at overly enthusiastic social media behavior.

these elements together strongly suggest that the tweet is deliberately sarcastic, likely mocking overzealous social media promotion and exaggerated online enthusiasm.",1

the irony lies in the fact that subroto roy sahara, who is associated with various legal controversies and has faced issues with delayed justice himself, is quoted saying ""justice delayed is justice denied"" in the foreword of a movie about the bhopal disaster. this creates a contradictory and somewhat hypocritical situation, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.",1

#Malala Yousufzai receives #NobelPeacePrize and #Pakistan ranks in top 10 dangerous countries !!! #irony,1,"given the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the use of the hashtag #irony at the end explicitly signals the sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of malala yousufzai receiving the nobel peace prize (a positive achievement) with pakistan ranking among the top 10 dangerous countries (a negative fact) creates a stark contrast that highlights the irony of the situation.
3. the use of multiple exclamation marks (!!!) emphasizes the speaker's exaggerated reaction, which is common in sarcastic expressions.
4. the concise, tweet-like format is often used for delivering quick, punchy sarcastic comments on social media.

the sarcasm here stems from pointing out the contradiction between honoring a pakistani peace activist internationally while the country itself remains dangerous, implying criticism of the disconnect between this individual achievement and the broader national context.",1
http://t.co/cbS3YfyKGw #Not so Ugly Christmas Sweater red with red snowflakes & sequins cardigan 1X XL http://t.co/Cy19OKfojm,0,"based on the given information and cues, i believe my judgment is reliable enough to provide a direct output.

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the phrase ""not so ugly christmas sweater"" suggests that this sweater is actually attractive, contrary to the typical ""ugly christmas sweater"" concept. this is likely a genuine description of a product that is meant to be appealing rather than intentionally unattractive. the additional details about the sweater (red with red snowflakes & sequins) further support that this is a sincere product description. the use of hashtags and links also indicates that this is likely a promotional or sales-oriented tweet, which tends to be straightforward rather than sarcastic.",0
Testing water temperatures #excitingtimes #Not,1,sarcastic,1
Waking up with your cat attacking your hand is always delightful..... #not,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text. the statement exhibits clear sarcastic characteristics:

1. it uses verbal irony by describing an unpleasant experience (being attacked by a cat) as ""delightful.""
2. the ellipsis (....) creates a dramatic pause, emphasizing the sarcastic tone.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the positive sentiment, confirming the sarcastic intent.
4. the informal tone and brief structure are consistent with typical sarcastic comments on social media.

these elements align perfectly with the cues provided, particularly the use of sarcasm, informal tone, ellipsis, and the hashtag to emphasize sarcastic intent. therefore, this text is unmistakably sarcastic.",1
"May not have hung out with you as much as some people, but every time we did it was a blast! You... http://t.co/Ikgz8u9Fos",0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits characteristics of sarcasm, particularly:

1. emotional contrast: the speaker acknowledges spending limited time with the person but emphasizes the high quality of their interactions. this contrast between quantity and quality is a common sarcastic device.

2. exaggeration: the use of ""it was a blast!"" after mentioning infrequent meetings suggests an over-the-top positive reaction, which is often indicative of sarcasm.

3. punctuation: the exclamation mark and ellipsis add emphasis and create a pause for dramatic effect, common in sarcastic expressions.

4. incomplete thought: the sentence ends abruptly with ""you..."" followed by a link, leaving the reader to infer the rest, which can be a sarcastic technique to imply something without stating it directly.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to comment on the quality of their interactions despite their infrequency, possibly masking disappointment or criticism with an overly positive tone.",1

Take me tooooo church #not,0,"sarcastic

the text ""take me tooooo church #not"" is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. the use of ""#not"" is a common way to indicate sarcasm on social media. it's used to contradict or negate the preceding statement.

2. the elongation of ""tooooo"" adds emphasis, often used in sarcastic or exaggerated statements.

3. the phrase ""take me to church"" is likely referencing the popular song, but the addition of ""#not"" completely reverses its meaning, creating a sarcastic tone.

4. the combination of these elements - casual language, exaggeration, and the contradictory hashtag - strongly signals sarcastic intent.

label: sarcastic

the key indicators of sarcasm in this tweet are:

1. the use of ""#not"" at the end of the tweet, which is a common way to indicate sarcasm or irony on social media.
2. the unlikely scenario described: obama announcing a package for pakistan that is supported by republicans (gop), which is unusual given the typical political disagreements between democrats and republicans.
3. the use of the term ""obscurantists"" in relation to pakistan's fight, which seems out of place and potentially mocking.

the tweet appears to be satirizing political cooperation and foreign policy decisions, using sarcasm to criticize or comment on the described situation. the ""#not"" at the end serves as a clear indicator that the preceding information should not be taken at face value, confirming the sarcastic nature of the tweet.",1

"@Pier1984_ Not going this time, we might have a chance! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..... #fuckthat",0,"sarcastic

i'm confident this tweet is sarcastic based on a few key elements:

1. the use of the well-known proverb ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice..."" which is deliberately left unfinished, implying the speaker has been fooled before.

2. the contrast between ""not going this time"" and ""we might have a chance!"" suggests irony.

3. the hashtag ""#fuckthat"" at the end expresses frustration and dismissal, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

4. the context implies the speaker has been disappointed before (likely by the team or event they're referring to) and is sarcastically suggesting that not attending might improve their chances.

@dzmilner Minky Wale tail fritter for price of a bijoux flat in Port Talbot.,0,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the exaggerated comparison between the price of a seemingly trivial food item (whale tail fritter) and a property (flat) is absurd and likely not meant to be taken literally.

2. the use of the term ""bijoux"" (small and elegant) to describe a flat in port talbot (a town not typically associated with luxury housing) creates an ironic contrast.

3. the informal and playful language (""minky wale tail fritter"") combined with the economic comparison suggests a humorous, non-serious tone.

4. the brevity and structure of the tweet-like format is often used for quick, witty, sarcastic comments on social media.

these elements together strongly indicate that the speaker is using sarcasm to comment on high food prices or, alternatively, low property prices in port talbot, rather than making a literal statement.",1

@onedirection guys!!! you've just smashed it!! #WhereDoBrokenHeartsGo #XFactorFinal,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this tweet.

label: sarcastic

the reason for this label is the juxtaposition between the extremely enthusiastic tone of the tweet and the melancholic theme of the song mentioned. the tweet uses multiple exclamation marks and positive language (""smashed it!!"") to express excitement about one direction's performance. however, this is contrasted with the hashtag #wheredobrokenheartsgo, which refers to a song with a sad theme about heartbreak.

this contrast between the overly jubilant reaction and the sorrowful song title creates a sarcastic undertone. the user appears to be ironically celebrating a performance of a sad song, which is a common form of sarcasm.

the use of multiple punctuation marks (!!!) and hashtags also aligns with typical sarcastic writing styles on social media, where exaggeration is often used to convey sarcasm.

therefore, considering these elements together, the tweet can be classified as sarcastic.",1

Two years later & gingerbread house making still makes me cry.,0,"based on the provided cues and input text, i believe i can reliably classify this statement.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits characteristics of sarcasm for the following reasons:

1. unexpected emotional response: gingerbread house making is typically associated with fun, festive activities, especially during holidays. crying in response to this activity is unexpected and incongruous.

2. persistence over time: the phrase ""two years later"" emphasizes that this unusual reaction has continued, which adds to the humorous exaggeration typical of sarcasm.

3. use of hyperbole: claiming that a benign activity like making gingerbread houses ""still makes me cry"" is likely an exaggeration for comedic effect, a common sarcastic technique.

4. implied criticism: the statement may be indirectly criticizing the difficulty or frustration associated with gingerbread house making, using sarcasm to express this sentiment.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that the statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically rather than literally, hence the classification as ""sarcastic.""",1
Amar Singh gives A+ rating to the Modi govt but Arun #Shourie says more is said than done in present govt #Irony #Politics,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm based on the following elements:

1. contrasting opinions: the tweet presents two opposing views on the modi government's performance - a highly positive rating from amar singh versus a critical assessment from arun shourie.

2. use of ""#irony"": the explicit inclusion of this hashtag is a strong indicator that the author is highlighting the contradictory nature of these assessments and doesn't take the positive rating at face value.

3. juxtaposition: the structure of the tweet, presenting the positive view first and then immediately contrasting it with a negative one, is a common sarcastic technique to emphasize the absurdity or unreliability of the initial statement.

4. political context: in political discourse, such stark contrasts are often used to sarcastically comment on the divisive nature of political opinions or the perceived gap between rhetoric and reality.

5. the hashtag ""#politics"" further frames this as commentary on the nature of political discourse rather than a straightforward report of differing opinions.

given these factors, the tweet is clearly using sarcasm to comment on the conflicting narratives surrounding the modi government's performance.",1

What to do with that old #motherboard you have laying around. #NOT http://t.co/RjtcaMq9Gz #guitarpicks,1,"based on the input text and the current cues provided, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the tweet appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of ""#not"" in the tweet is a strong indicator of sarcasm. people often use ""not"" to contradict what they've just said, which is a common sarcastic device.

2. the tweet suggests making guitar picks out of old motherboards (as indicated by the hashtag #guitarpicks). this is an unconventional and impractical use for old motherboards, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

3. the contrast between the seemingly serious question ""what to do with that old #motherboard"" and the absurd suggestion of making guitar picks creates a sarcastic effect.

4. the cues mention that old motherboards can be repurposed or recycled, but making guitar picks is not a typical or practical way to repurpose them, further supporting the sarcastic interpretation.

therefore, the tweet is using sarcasm to humorously comment on the challenge of disposing of old computer parts, rather than seriously suggesting a use for them.",1

"Just ranted on and the moment I'm about to hit send, my ipod just died. #greatmorning #NOT",1,"based on the content and context of the input text, as well as the punctuation cues provided, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the phrase ""great morning"" is used ironically, as the situation described (ipod dying just before sending a message) is actually frustrating, not great.

2. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly negating the previous positive statement.

3. the juxtaposition of a negative event with the seemingly positive hashtag ""#greatmorning"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

these elements, combined with the frustrated tone of the message, strongly indicate that this text is sarcastic in nature.",1
30 week scan #not #long #now #exciting #memory #all #good #happy #clear #baby #boy @ Portlaoise... http://t.co/CLfUfZ3vdF,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

### label:
not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the tweet is about a 30-week pregnancy scan, which is typically a positive and exciting event for expectant parents.

2. the emotional words extracted (exciting, good, happy) are all positive, indicating genuine enthusiasm and joy.

3. the extensive use of positive hashtags (#exciting, #good, #happy) further reinforces the sincere and non-sarcastic nature of the message.

4. there's no indication of irony or contradiction in the text that might suggest sarcasm.

5. the context of sharing a pregnancy-related update on social media is often sincere and meant to share good news with friends and followers.

6. the ellipsis (...) and the link at the end suggest that there might be an accompanying image or more information, which is common for sharing such milestones.

given these factors, the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of excitement and happiness about an upcoming birth, without any sarcastic undertones.",0
@cnsnews Obama and Hillary convinced Ukraine that they would protect them if they essentially disarm. Need to keep at least one promise.,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements, particularly in its implication that obama and hillary have a poor track record of keeping promises, and the sardonic suggestion that they should ""keep at least one promise."" this aligns with the cues identifying sarcasm and implication in the statement, as well as the allusion to a complex political situation that's being critically commented on.",1

@GazzaDowns I actually think he needs to use the youngsters in this reincarnation #irony,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author is being sarcastic. the hashtag explicitly states the intention of irony.

2. the phrase ""i actually think"" often prefaces a statement that is contrary to what the speaker truly believes, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. the context suggests that the author doesn't genuinely believe that using youngsters is a good idea for this ""reincarnation"" (likely referring to a team or project), but is rather mocking this approach.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this text.",1
What a golden morning. 😒 #not,1,sarcastic,1
Sleep. SLEEP YOU STUPID IDIOT I WANNA LEAVE MY ROOM,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm through several factors:

1. the use of self-directed insults (""you stupid idiot"") is often a sarcastic device, especially when the speaker is frustrated with themselves.

2. the dramatic shift from the calm, one-word sentence ""sleep."" to the all-caps outburst creates a stark contrast that is typical of sarcastic expressions.

3. the personification of sleep, addressing it as if it were a person who could follow commands, is a common sarcastic technique.

4. the exaggerated frustration expressed through capitalization and strong language is often used in sarcastic venting.

5. the absurdity of yelling at oneself to sleep, when yelling would typically prevent sleep, adds to the sarcastic tone.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic expression of frustration with one's inability to fall asleep, rather than a genuine belief that yelling at oneself will induce sleep.",1
LIBERAL/#LEFTISTS USE #RACIST/SEXIST #LABEL FOR |#DISLIKES|MSNBC host Ed Schultz said RACIST #NOT to SUPPORT demand for #MINIMUM WAGE|#SAD,0,"sarcastic

the text displays several hallmarks of sarcastic political commentary on social media:

1. exaggerated use of hashtags and capitalization
2. fragmented structure mimicking and mocking typical social media posts
3. use of polarizing language and accusatory tone
4. juxtaposition of serious political topics with informal, abbreviated language

the overall effect appears to be a satirical imitation of how some people perceive liberal discourse on social media, rather than a genuine political statement. the exaggerated style and structure suggest the author is likely mocking or critiquing this type of communication, rather than sincerely engaging in it.",1
Read at http://t.co/HbeAb2hklW the news '#Obama: #The #American #way #of #life #is #not #a #gift',0,"based on the information provided and the context clues, i would label this text as:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward reference to a news article or statement made by president obama.
2. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, irony, or humor in the brief text provided.
3. the use of hashtags and a shortened url is typical of social media sharing, particularly on platforms like twitter, and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm.
4. the quoted statement ""the american way of life is not a gift"" seems to be presented as a serious political or social commentary, rather than a sarcastic remark.
5. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's most likely that this is a genuine sharing of news content rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
Really missing my momma today.. More than usual. I don't think today will be a good day,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the text expresses genuine emotions of missing someone (the author's mother) and anticipating a difficult day. the emotional words and phrases extracted, such as ""missing,"" ""more than usual,"" and ""not a good day,"" all convey sincere feelings of sadness and longing. the use of multiple periods after ""momma today"" emphasizes the emotional weight of the statement. there are no indicators of irony or sarcasm in the text; instead, it appears to be a straightforward expression of the author's current emotional state. therefore, this text is clearly not sarcastic, but rather a sincere expression of feelings.",0
"@davidwhite_ Nevermind that, but do pray tell,would Scherzy still play Grizabella?",0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

the tweet appears to be a genuine inquiry about casting for a theater production, specifically asking if nicole scherzinger (""scherzy"") would play the role of grizabella. the language used, while somewhat theatrical with the phrase ""pray tell,"" doesn't indicate any sarcastic intent. the question seems to be asked in earnest, seeking information about a potential casting decision. the tone is curious and casual, which is consistent with a non-sarcastic social media interaction about a topic of interest to the user.",0
Everyone wants the truth but nobody wants to be honest... #irony,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

the text appears to be a straightforward expression of the author's genuine opinion or prediction about a potential political situation. while the statement involves speculation about politically motivated actions, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the author seems to be sincerely expressing their expectation of a possible escalation in border tensions during the delhi elections, potentially as a tactic to influence election issues. the informal language and lack of humor or contradictory elements further support that this is likely a non-sarcastic comment on a serious political matter.",0
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top UNLESS YOU'RE SKINNY #Shade #Sarcasm #TheMoreYouKnow,0,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the use of capital letters for ""unless you're skinny"" followed by hashtags like ""#shade"" and ""#sarcasm"" make the sarcastic intent obvious. the message is ironically critiquing inconsistencies in some body positivity messaging by sarcastically implying that being skinny is excluded from the ""every inch is perfect"" sentiment. this aligns perfectly with the cues provided about the text using irony to point out contradictions in body acceptance rhetoric.",1
Take a look at those calves!!! 😎😎😂😂 ladies love the calves! #not #about #the #arms #its #about... http://t.co/R7OWkjcBmq,0,"based on the input text, hashtags, and emojis, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the exaggerated enthusiasm (""take a look at those calves!!!"" with multiple exclamation marks and laughing emojis) suggests an over-the-top tone often associated with sarcasm.

2. the use of the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, implying the opposite of what's being said.

3. the series of hashtags breaking up the phrase ""#not #about #the #arms #its #about"" is likely meant to be read as ""it's not about the arms, it's about..."" which contradicts the initial focus on calves, adding to the sarcastic tone.

4. the combination of cool sunglasses emojis (😎) with laughing emojis (😂) further reinforces the mocking, sarcastic tone of the post.

given these elements, it's highly likely that the author is being sarcastic about the importance or attractiveness of calves, possibly poking fun at gym culture or body image standards.",1
@CaleCowan your tongue in cheek @timescolonist weigh in does nothing but instigate breed specific hate. Stick to reporting on tuques. #yyj,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to criticize the journalist (@calecowan) for their article in @timescolonist. the phrase ""tongue in cheek"" directly indicates a sarcastic or ironic tone. the suggestion to ""stick to reporting on tuques"" is not meant literally, but rather as a sarcastic jab implying the journalist should avoid controversial topics they may not handle well. the overall tone and content of the tweet align with the cues provided, indicating criticism of local journalism on a controversial topic like breed-specific legislation.",1

sarcastic

the tweet is clearly expressing sarcasm by pointing out the ironic situation where ward is angry at skye for keeping a secret, likely when ward himself has been keeping significant secrets. this irony is explicitly called out with the hashtag ""#irony"" in the tweet. the tone and context strongly indicate this is a sarcastic commentary on the characters' situation in the tv show ""agents of s.h.i.e.l.d.""",1
"While we applauded ourselves on getting to the Moon, Carl Sagan spoke a truth we all denied.|#irony http://t.co/AY20dRme0L",1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the presence of the hashtag ""#irony"" is a strong indicator that the tweet is meant to be understood ironically or sarcastically.

2. the contrast between ""applauded ourselves"" and ""truth we all denied"" suggests a critical or ironic view of the situation.

3. the emotional words ""applauded,"" ""truth,"" and ""denied"" create a juxtaposition that is often used in sarcastic statements.

4. the reference to carl sagan, known for his scientific skepticism and critical thinking, in contrast with collective self-congratulation, further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

this tweet appears to be using sarcasm to criticize the disconnect between the achievement of reaching the moon and ignoring some important truth pointed out by carl sagan.",1

this text appears to be a straightforward product listing for a dress. it contains factual information about the item, including its name, price, size, and instructions for purchase. there are no indicators of sarcasm or irony present. the language is direct, concise, and typical of e-commerce or social media product advertisements. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""not sarcastic"".",0
@GalloSays this game is pathetic. How are they losing this game?,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. the use of a rhetorical question (""how are they losing this game?"") to express disbelief or frustration rather than to seek an actual answer.
2. the strong negative emotion and criticism expressed through words like ""pathetic,"" which is often used sarcastically to emphasize disappointment.
3. the contrast between the expectation (that the team should be winning) and the reality (that they are losing), which is a common setup for sarcastic comments.
4. the informal, social media style of language, which is often a context where sarcasm is employed.

while the statement is indeed critical and expresses genuine frustration, the rhetorical question and the exaggerated description of the game as ""pathetic"" suggest a sarcastic tone meant to emphasize the speaker's disappointment and disbelief at the unexpected outcome of the game.",1
bromanceshmomance: #I just checked and he has zero#ZERO#mentions asking if Louis was there#NONE#NADA#not... http://t.co/b4W8LszSwZ,0,"based on the cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of the made-up word ""bromanceshmomance"" suggests a mocking or dismissive tone towards the concept of bromance.

2. the emphatic repetition and capitalization of ""zero#zero"" and ""#none#nada"" indicate exaggeration and frustration, which are common in sarcastic expressions.

3. the overall structure of the tweet, with its repetitive emphasis on the absence of mentions, seems to be sarcastically pointing out someone's obsessive or misplaced focus on louis's presence.

4. the hashtag-like formatting within the text (#zero#, #none#nada#) is often used in social media to convey sarcasm or emphasis.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic, likely criticizing someone's excessive interest in louis's whereabouts or participation in something.",1
Being a light sleeper is the best. #not,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the statement ""being a light sleeper is the best"" is likely not meant to be taken literally. light sleepers often have difficulty getting restful sleep, which is generally not considered a positive trait.

2. the use of the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this hashtag is commonly used to negate the preceding statement, implying the opposite of what was just said.

3. the combination of an apparently positive statement followed by ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure, where the true meaning is the opposite of the literal words.

therefore, the text is clearly sarcastic, using irony to express frustration with being a light sleeper.",1

The only company I thought would be best for the thesis is unfortunately taken already... a year ago..,0,"based on the input text and the provided context cues, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

the sarcasm in this statement is evident from a few key elements:

1. the use of ""unfortunately"" followed by ellipsis (...) indicates a sense of exaggerated disappointment.

2. the addition of ""a year ago.."" at the end, also with ellipsis, emphasizes the long time that has passed since the company was taken. this creates a contrast between the speaker's current disappointment and the fact that the opportunity has been unavailable for quite some time.

3. the repetition of ellipsis (...) twice in the short statement adds to the dramatic, exaggerated tone typical of sarcasm.

the speaker seems to be sarcastically expressing frustration not just at missing out on their preferred company, but also at their own lack of awareness or preparation, given that the opportunity has been unavailable for a whole year. this self-deprecating tone, combined with the exaggerated disappointment, strongly indicates a sarcastic intent.",1
@MyzzCryz not worried about it. Whenevs 😉,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the contrast between the statement of not being worried and the extremely casual ""whenevs"" with a winking emoji strongly suggests sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing the opposite of what they're saying, using a deliberately carefree tone to mask actual concern or frustration.",1
@lr3031 @mjgranger1 #not enough; unfortunately.,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is very short and lacks sufficient context to infer sarcasm.
2. while the words ""not enough"" and ""unfortunately"" convey disappointment, there's no clear contrast or irony that would indicate sarcasm.
3. the structure appears to be a straightforward social media comment or reply, likely expressing genuine disappointment or dissatisfaction.
4. there are no rhetorical devices or language patterns typically associated with sarcasm.
5. the brevity and direct nature of the comment suggest it's meant to be taken at face value rather than interpreted sarcastically.

without more context or clear indicators of irony or exaggeration, it's safer to interpret this text as a sincere, non-sarcastic comment.",0

"It's really #NOT #GOOD, too have the #REPUTATION for STEALING FROM GIRLS. @HAUSOFSE7EN & Mr. MASON,..expect a call,..(;",0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the use of capitalized words and hashtags for emphasis (e.g., ""#not #good"", ""#reputation"", ""stealing"") suggests an exaggerated tone.

2. the contrast between the seemingly casual opening ""it's really #not #good"" and the serious accusation of ""stealing from girls"" creates ironic understatement.

3. the playful use of ellipsis and a winking emoticon ""(;"" at the end contrasts with the serious nature of the accusation, indicating a less-than-serious tone.

4. the overall structure mimics a warning or threat (""expect a call""), but the delivery and formatting suggest it's not meant to be taken entirely at face value.

these elements, combined with the negative emotions and disapproving tone identified in the cues, strongly indicate that the text is using sarcasm to criticize or mock the subjects mentioned (@hausofse7en & mr. mason) for their alleged behavior.",1
"we need to stop using the words ""racist"" & ""racism"" @nicky0472 @StevenWayneOwen @TheLexZane @nobamamustgo @Anan_VII @TheOldBreed1775",0,"based on the input and the cues provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward statement or suggestion made on a social media platform, likely twitter. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal meaning and the intended meaning. the use of quotation marks around ""racist"" and ""racism"" seems to be for emphasis rather than to convey a sarcastic tone. the direct nature of the statement and the use of multiple twitter handles suggest that this is a sincere call to action or opinion, rather than a sarcastic comment.",0

From what I can tell...most strippers belong right where they are #nocollegeneeded #adamsmith #specialization #strippers,0,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of hashtags like ""#nocollegeneeded"" and ""#specialization"" in conjunction with discussing strippers is meant to be ironic.

2. referencing adam smith (the father of modern economics) in relation to stripping is likely intended as a humorous and unexpected connection.

3. the overall tone of the statement, implying that strippers ""belong right where they are,"" is likely meant to mock prejudiced views about sex workers rather than express a genuine opinion.

4. the combination of seemingly intellectual references (adam smith, specialization) with a topic often viewed as less intellectually demanding (stripping) creates a satirical contrast.

the sarcasm in this text is used to critique stereotypes about strippers and possibly comment on issues of education, economics, and societal views of sex work, all while using a mocking tone.",1
"@Salon dualistic, as in good and evil? Right, because that doesn't apply to the real world.... #sarcasm #OrcsLive",1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

the tweet uses hashtags like ""#consensus of absolute hilarious #irony"" and phrases the idea of michael mann lecturing on professional ethics as a question, strongly implying that the author finds this situation ironic or contradictory. the use of ""hilarious"" and ""irony"" in conjunction with the questioning tone clearly indicates a sarcastic intent, mocking the idea of mann giving such a lecture.",1
5 dollar OBX 1 dollar Gboro gone #lockitin #lottoclub #bankopen #doumenturdeposit#not criminal http://t.co/nYsbehzJqS,0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward, albeit cryptic, message about some form of gambling or betting activity. it uses informal language, abbreviations, and hashtags typical of social media posts, particularly twitter. while the exact meaning is not entirely clear without more context, there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm in the language used.

the message seems to be conveying information about bets or transactions in different locations (obx and gboro, likely referring to outer banks and greensboro) with specific dollar amounts. the hashtags appear to be related to gambling or lottery activities (#lockitin, #lottoclub) and possibly asserting the legality of the activity (#not criminal).

without any clear contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic statements that would typically signal sarcasm, it's most appropriate to classify this text as ""not sarcastic."" the message appears to be a genuine, albeit cryptic, communication about some form of betting or financial activity.",0

sarcastic

the use of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end of the tweet explicitly indicates that the author intends the message to be interpreted sarcastically. additionally, the contrast between the seemingly positive action (putting someone at the top of a christmas tree because they like christmas) and the implied negative or insincere tone supports this classification.",1
"Regarding my #ATT case; I've contacted the BBB, FCC, and my States Attorney General. next... #WFAA #not #stopping",0,"based on the input text and the extracted topic information, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of frustration and determination from a customer who is having issues with at&t. the user is listing the various authorities they have contacted (bbb, fcc, state attorney general) and indicating they will continue to pursue their complaint. the hashtag ""#not #stopping"" further emphasizes their seriousness and persistence. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement; instead, it reads as a straightforward account of actions taken in a consumer dispute.",0
Acronyms because we're cool as fuck. Judge me. http://t.co/0CK2VNqIKR,0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward, confident statement rather than sarcasm. the author is expressing a positive attitude towards using acronyms and challenging others to judge them for it. the tone is casual and defiant, but there's no indication of irony or saying the opposite of what is meant, which are key components of sarcasm. the use of profanity and the casual tone reinforce the genuineness of the statement rather than suggesting a sarcastic intent.",0

Reunited with my pump this morning. #yay #not 😣,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""#yay"" followed immediately by ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the ""#not"" negates the seemingly positive ""#yay,"" revealing the true negative sentiment.

2. the unhappy/frustrated emoji (😣) at the end further confirms the negative emotion, contrasting with the superficially positive ""reunited"" and ""#yay"".

3. the phrase ""reunited with my pump"" suggests a medical device or treatment, which is typically not something one would be excited about.

4. the combination of seemingly positive words (""reunited"", ""#yay"") with clearly negative indicators (""#not"", 😣) is a common sarcastic structure, where the true sentiment is opposite to the initial positive statement.

this text is a clear example of sarcasm, where the author is expressing frustration or disappointment about having to use their pump again, while initially framing it as a positive event.",1
"My dad's still gonna get me santa's gifts since it's my last year before 18, but I really don't know what to ask for... #irony",1,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the use of the hashtag #irony at the end is a strong indicator that the writer sees irony in their situation. the irony stems from the fact that they're almost 18 years old - legally an adult in many places - yet their father still wants to maintain the childhood tradition of ""santa's gifts."" the writer's struggle to think of gift requests further emphasizes the disconnect between their approaching adulthood and this childish tradition. the sarcasm is subtle but evident in the juxtaposition of these elements and the explicit labeling of the situation as ironic.",1
Remember that one time I worked both jobs while sick and it didnt suck at all... #sarcasm #notworthit,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text for the following reasons:

1. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates the sarcastic intent of the message.

2. the phrase ""it didnt suck at all"" is clearly meant to be interpreted in the opposite way, implying that it actually did suck a lot.

3. the hashtag ""#notworthit"" further reinforces the negative experience, contrasting with the seemingly positive statement.

4. the cues provided mention ""sarcastic commentary about the experience being unpleasant,"" which aligns perfectly with the content of this tweet.

5. the overall structure of the tweet is a common sarcastic format, where a negative experience is described in falsely positive terms for emphasis.

therefore, this text is undoubtedly sarcastic in nature.",1

"@MericaMcFreedom @Heritage Actually, even delivery won't save some. O voted to let born alive die. Also, look up ""4th trimester abortions"".",0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be making direct claims and arguments about a controversial political topic (abortion and related legislation).
2. while the term ""4th trimester abortions"" is hyperbolic, it seems to be used as a rhetorical device to emphasize a point rather than as sarcasm.
3. the tone is argumentative and assertive, without clear indicators of irony or mocking that would typically characterize sarcasm.
4. the text appears to be part of a serious political discussion, albeit one containing controversial claims and potential misinformation.

while the content is provocative and contains exaggeration, it does not exhibit the typical hallmarks of sarcasm such as deliberate irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. instead, it seems to be a straightforward, if controversial, expression of political views.",0
good luck finding someone to take the other side of that bet LOL @orion99da,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the phrase ""good luck finding someone"" is a sarcastic way of saying it's unlikely or impossible to find someone to take the other side of the bet.
2. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end emphasizes the speaker's amusement at the absurdity of the situation, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.
3. the contrast between wishing someone ""good luck"" while clearly implying it won't happen is a classic sarcastic structure.

these elements together create a sarcastic statement that mocks the idea of finding someone to take the opposite side of what is presumably an obviously one-sided bet.",1

the text exhibits clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the overly enthusiastic exclamation ""what a great way to start the day!!"" contrasts with the negative sentiment implied.
2. the use of ""#not"" is a common way to explicitly indicate sarcasm on social media.
3. the angry emoji 😠 further contradicts the seemingly positive statement, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

these elements together create a classic sarcastic expression, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended message. the person is actually having a bad start to their day and is expressing their frustration through sarcasm.",1

not sarcastic

explanation:
this tweet appears to be a straightforward, though somewhat unkind, call-out of a teammate. the user is directly tagging someone (@sam__clough) and stating that they frequently run the sideline, implying they're not good enough to play regularly. while the content may be harsh or teasing, it doesn't contain elements of sarcasm. the apology ""i'm sorry to say"" seems to be a genuine, if mild, expression of regret for calling out the teammate, rather than a sarcastic remark.",0
@Elena_in_Rome easiest CL group with two rubbish teams but we won only 1 CL game - even that lucky last minute pen#not good enough#gutted,0,"based on the content and context provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcasm for the following reasons:

1. the author describes the champions league group as ""easiest"" with ""two rubbish teams,"" which sets up an expectation of good performance.

2. however, this is immediately contrasted with ""but we won only 1 cl game,"" which subverts the expectation set up in the first part.

3. the author further emphasizes the poor performance by noting that even the single win was due to a ""lucky last minute pen"" (penalty).

4. the use of hashtags ""#not good enough"" and ""#gutted"" reinforce the disappointment and sarcastic tone.

the sarcasm lies in the juxtaposition of the seemingly easy group with the team's unexpectedly poor performance. the author is using irony to criticize their team's results, making this statement clearly sarcastic.",1
No one up? Okay cool #not,1,"sarcastic

the use of ""#not"" at the end of the statement is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this hashtag is commonly used to negate the preceding statement in a sarcastic manner. the poster is expressing disappointment about the lack of activity or response, and the ""#not"" emphasizes that they do not actually think it's ""cool"" that no one is up or responding. this ironic contrast between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.",1

this appears to be a straightforward social media post about someone listening to a song. it uses common hashtags like #nowplaying and #music to share what they're currently listening to. the post mentions the song title, artist, and partial album name, but doesn't contain any sarcastic elements or contradictory tones. it's a typical format for sharing music on platforms like twitter, so i would classify this as ""not sarcastic"".",0

label: sarcastic

explanation:
this text appears to be sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the phrase ""here we go again"" often indicates frustration or sarcasm.
2. the use of ""thanks to all that claim to cover wvhs hoop"" seems to be criticizing those who supposedly cover the high school basketball games.
3. most importantly, the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it's used to negate the previous statement, implying that the thanks is not genuine.
4. the contrast between the sarcastic first part and the factual report of the game result in the second part further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

the presence of specific punctuation (comma, hashtag, at symbol, and hyphen) supports the complex structure of the tweet, which combines sarcasm with actual information. the use of the hashtag, in particular, is crucial in identifying the sarcastic intent.",1
Long day and its not going to be possible without my good friend #coffee,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of personification of coffee as a ""good friend"" suggests a humorous or exaggerated tone.
2. the hashtag #coffee emphasizes the importance placed on coffee, which can be seen as a playful exaggeration.
3. the contrast between the negative ""long day"" and the positive portrayal of coffee as a necessary friend creates a subtle irony.
4. the informal tone and lack of punctuation at the end contribute to a casual, potentially sarcastic voice.

while the statement could be sincere, the combination of these elements leans more towards a sarcastic expression of reliance on coffee to get through a challenging day.",1

label: sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic, as indicated by several factors:

1. the use of exaggerated enthusiasm (""i love"") for an activity most people dislike (getting up very early).
2. the mention of an extremely early time (4:30) for waking up.
3. the phrase ""so i can wait on other ppl"" implies serving others, which is presented as if it's a desirable outcome of waking up so early.
4. the explicit use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the text, which directly labels the statement as sarcastic.

these elements, combined with the cues provided about the topic and nature of the text, make it unambiguous that this is a sarcastic statement.",1

and as much as I want to connect .. I like only the people who dont want to .. #Irony #Why oh why?,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this text based on the following reasons:

1. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly indicates that the author is being ironic or sarcastic.

2. the content of the message presents a paradoxical situation: wanting to connect with people who don't want to connect, which is a common structure for sarcastic statements.

3. the emotional words and overall tone, as noted in the cues, suggest frustration and self-deprecating humor, which are often associated with sarcasm.

4. the use of ellipsis (...) and the hashtag ""#why oh why?"" further emphasize the exasperated, dramatic tone often found in sarcastic expressions.

5. the contrast between the desire to connect and the preference for those who don't want to connect creates the ironic tension typical of sarcastic statements.

given these factors, it's clear that the text is intentionally using sarcasm to express the author's feelings about social connection.",1

sarcastic

the presence of the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end of the tweet is a clear and explicit indicator that the message is intended to be sarcastic. additionally, the exaggerated phrasing ""are you saying all blonde white women look the same??"" further supports the sarcastic tone. the author is likely using sarcasm to point out the absurdity or inappropriateness of such a generalization.",1
@ChristianCaple Gotta love those racially based awards! #not,1,"based on the current cues and the content of the tweet, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the tweet uses sarcasm to criticize racially-based awards. the phrase ""gotta love"" combined with the hashtag ""#not"" at the end clearly indicates that the author does not actually love or approve of such awards, but is using sarcasm to express disapproval or criticism. this aligns with the cues provided, which correctly identified the sarcastic nature of the tweet.",1
"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul, and makes us reach for more...💖",0,"not sarcastic

clashupdate #not http://t.co/1bFOsIwnI5,1,"based on the limited information provided in the input text and the current cues, i'll assign a label:

### label:
sarcastic

reasoning:
while the text is very brief, the use of ""#not"" is often associated with sarcasm on social media platforms. the hashtag ""#not"" is typically used to contradict or negate the statement that precedes it, implying the opposite of what was just said. in this case, ""clashupdate #not"" suggests that the linked content (http://t.co/1bfosiwni5) is likely not actually a clash (presumably referring to the game clash of clans or a similar game) update, or is mocking the idea of an update in some way. this use of contradiction to convey the opposite meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1
@allkpop: Super Junior's Henry asks sasaeng fans to let him sleep|http://t.co/BhrEKEtMka http://t.co/mvzxJL04PL||Aw Henry oppa >^<,0,"based on the provided cues and context, i can confidently assign a label to this input text.

label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward report of an event (henry asking sasaeng fans to let him sleep) followed by a genuine, sympathetic response from a fan. the use of ""aw"" and the affectionate term ""oppa"" along with the cute emoticon "">^<"" indicate sincere concern and fondness for henry, rather than sarcasm. the contrast between the frustration implied in henry's request and the fan's affectionate response is typical of celebrity-fan dynamics and doesn't suggest sarcastic intent.",0

@jthurgood1 @Cameron_Gray republicans suck more at identifying #irony than alanis morissette.,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the tweet uses exaggeration and comparison to mock republicans, comparing their ability to identify irony unfavorably to alanis morissette (whose song ""ironic"" is often criticized for not actually containing many ironic situations). the negative tone, use of hyperbole, and the explicit mention of irony all strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic statement.",1

Name an #excuse that people use #NOT to #workout ... http://t.co/tE75PwPGbm,0,"based on the current cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. it's framed as a challenge or request to name excuses people use to avoid working out, implying that these excuses are common and perhaps not very legitimate.

2. the use of hashtags, especially ""#not"", is often associated with sarcastic or ironic statements on social media.

3. the ellipsis at the end suggests a trailing off, possibly implying that there are many such excuses and they're all equally flimsy.

4. the inclusion of a link suggests that the tweet is part of a larger conversation or content piece about workout excuses, likely approaching the topic with humor or criticism.

5. the overall tone is light and playful, consistent with sarcastic commentary on common behavioral patterns.

these elements combined strongly indicate that the tweet is meant to be read sarcastically, poking fun at people's tendency to make excuses for not exercising.",1
"@SteveMcKrosky @imbalaska @DaveMyFace @Clover_Joy_ @den2114 @MeyrickHarris ""left regressives"" is that not a label #irony",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator that the author is being sarcastic. they are pointing out the irony of using the term ""left regressives"" while seemingly criticizing the use of labels. this ironic contrast, combined with the rhetorical question format and the explicit mention of irony, strongly suggests that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1

1. the use of the hashtag #sarcasm at the end of the tweet explicitly signals the author's sarcastic intent.

2. the rhetorical question ""who moves that quickly on a coaching search?"" is meant to be ironic, implying that 3 weeks is actually more than enough time to hire a coach.

3. the statement ""you can't expect us to hire one in only 3 weeks"" is exaggerated to the point of absurdity, given that 3 weeks is generally considered a reasonable timeframe for such a process.

these elements, combined with the explanation provided in the current cues, strongly support the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1
A #celebrity is a person who is known for his well-knownness. #fact #TeamFollowBack #irony,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the definition provided is circular and deliberately nonsensical, defining a celebrity as someone ""known for his well-knownness.""

2. the use of hashtags, particularly ""#irony,"" explicitly signals the sarcastic intent.

3. the combination of ""#fact"" with this circular definition further emphasizes the satirical nature of the statement.

4. the inclusion of ""#teamfollowback"" alongside a comment about celebrities being known just for being known adds an extra layer of commentary on social media culture and hollow fame.

these elements together create a sarcastic commentary on the nature of celebrity culture, suggesting that some people are famous simply for being famous, rather than for any particular talent or achievement. the sarcasm is used to critique this aspect of modern celebrity.",1

1. the explicit use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" in the tweet.
2. the context of political figures and the nhs, which is often a subject of contentious debate and sarcastic commentary in uk politics.
3. the seemingly agreeable tone (""we agree"") contrasted with the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", suggesting the opposite meaning is intended.
4. the mention of jeremy hunt, who was a controversial figure as health secretary, further reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

these elements strongly suggest that the tweet is intended to be read sarcastically, criticizing the transparency or actions of the nhs or the politicians mentioned.",1
"If you've got the world on a string, you should give me some of that string, think of all the cool applications. #whatamidoing",0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it playfully subverts the metaphorical idiom ""have the world on a string"" by treating it literally, asking for some of the ""string.""

2. the juxtaposition of the grand idea of having ""the world on a string"" with the mundane request for ""some of that string"" creates a humorous contrast.

3. the vague reference to ""cool applications"" for the metaphorical string adds to the absurdist humor.

4. the hashtag ""#whatamidoing"" at the end suggests self-awareness about the silliness of the statement, which is a common feature in sarcastic comments.

5. the overall tone is lighthearted and not meant to be taken seriously, which is often the case with sarcastic remarks.

while the sarcasm here is gentle and playful rather than biting or critical, the text does use irony and humor in a way that's characteristic of sarcastic expression. therefore, labeling this as ""sarcastic"" seems most appropriate.",1
Christmas this Christmas that FOH its just a day people !! get a grip and sit down nd chow some Mopani worms,0,"based on the language style cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

1. it uses exaggeration and dismissiveness towards christmas celebrations (""christmas this christmas that"").
2. the use of ""foh"" (f*** outta here) indicates frustration and dismissal of the topic.
3. the phrase ""get a grip"" suggests the speaker thinks others are overreacting.
4. the contrast between typical christmas expectations and the casual suggestion to ""sit down nd chow some mopani worms"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

the informal language, use of slang, and overall dismissive attitude towards the holiday strongly indicate that this statement is meant to be read as sarcastic commentary on christmas enthusiasm.",1

Bitches be like ..... #more #appointments #please #not#crazy#enough .... YET @ orthodontist http://t.co/p7PycV1NMU,0,"based on the input text and the cues provided, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""bitches be like"" is often associated with sarcastic or mocking statements.

2. the hashtags ""#more #appointments #please"" seem to be used ironically, as most people don't actually want more appointments, especially at an orthodontist.

3. the hashtags ""#not#crazy#enough .... yet"" further reinforce the sarcastic tone, implying that multiple appointments are driving the person towards craziness.

4. the overall structure and tone of the tweet, combined with the exaggerated use of hashtags, is consistent with a sarcastic expression of frustration or annoyance with having to attend multiple orthodontist appointments.

therefore, the tweet appears to be using sarcasm to express frustration about having multiple orthodontist appointments.",1

the juxtaposition of ""#science"" with religious concepts like the garden of eden and references to kent hovind (a controversial young-earth creationist) could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic by some, especially if the intent is to critique creationist views. however, it could also be a genuine attempt to discuss these topics from a particular religious perspective.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the ambiguity of the truncated content, i don't have enough information to confidently label this as either ""sarcastic"" or ""not sarcastic"". the intent and tone would likely become clearer if we had access to the full content of the linked material.",0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""today's gonna be a good one..."" followed by ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the ellipsis (...) builds suspense, and the hashtag ""#not"" directly contradicts the preceding statement, which is a common sarcastic technique.

2. the content describes a negative emotional state (crying, lack of sleep, stress, anxiety) but then sarcastically claims the day will be ""good,"" which is inconsistent with the described situation.

3. the presence of the ellipsis and hashtag in the punctuation cues supports the sarcastic tone, as these are often used in online communication to convey irony or sarcasm.

therefore, the text is clearly sarcastic in nature, using irony to express frustration with a difficult situation.",1

2. the question ""don't you just love..."" is rhetorical and actually implies the opposite of what it's asking, which is a common sarcastic technique.

3. the tone is informal and uses colloquial expressions like ""won't shut up,"" which aligns with the language style cues provided.

4. there's a clear negative sentiment expressed towards a specific group of people (those who talk and ask for repetitions in class), but it's framed in a falsely positive way (""don't you just love...""), which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

5. the overall structure and content of the text match multiple cues provided, including informal tone, rhetorical question, use of colloquial expression, negative sentiment, and social media style.

The #Congressional #report on #torture #confirms that #AlQaeda was #not #involved in the #attacks of #September 11|http://t.co/GNBabcXR25,0,"based on the information provided and my analysis, i would assign the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text.

reasoning:
1. the content of the tweet is factually incorrect. al-qaeda was indeed responsible for the september 11 attacks, which is widely known and accepted.

2. the use of numerous hashtags for almost every word in the tweet could be seen as exaggeration, which is often a characteristic of sarcasm.

3. the tweet appears to be making a bold and controversial claim about a well-known historical event, which is often a tactic used in sarcastic or satirical posts to highlight absurdity.

4. the juxtaposition of a ""congressional report on torture"" with a claim about al-qaeda's non-involvement in 9/11 seems deliberately misleading or confusing, which could be interpreted as a sarcastic commentary on the complexity or perceived inconsistencies in official reports.

5. given the serious nature of the topics (torture, terrorism, 9/11), using sarcasm might be a way to critique or comment on the handling or reporting of these issues.

while sarcasm can be difficult to detect in written form without additional context, the combination of factual inaccuracy, excessive hashtag use, and the bold nature of the claim suggests this tweet is likely meant to be read sarcastically, possibly as a critique of misinformation or conspiracy theories.",1

When I'm lacking inspiration I resort to scribbling angry/pretty things. Great start to the week! #sarcasm http://t.co/5QUSrZYBqA,1,"sarcastic

i can confidently assign the label ""sarcastic"" to this input text for the following reasons:

1. the tweet ends with the explicit hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is a clear indicator that the author intends the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

2. the phrase ""great start to the week!"" contrasts with the negative tone of the rest of the tweet (lacking inspiration, scribbling angry things), which is a common sarcastic technique of saying the opposite of what is meant.

3. the keywords extracted, particularly ""lacking inspiration,"" ""angry,"" and ""sarcasm,"" all point towards a sarcastic tone.

4. the overall structure of the tweet, where a seemingly positive statement follows a description of a frustrating situation, is a classic sarcastic format.

Also it's amazing how a shower and Taco Bell can make you feel like a new person. @TacoBellProbbs,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it exaggerates the effect of mundane activities (showering and eating fast food) to an absurd degree, claiming they can make you feel like ""a new person.""

2. there's an implicit contrast between the low effort/quality of these activities and the dramatic claimed outcome.

3. the inclusion of taco bell, a fast-food chain not typically associated with wellness or self-improvement, adds to the sarcastic tone.

4. the use of ""amazing"" in this context is likely meant ironically, further supporting the sarcastic interpretation.

5. the twitter handle @tacobellprobbs (presumably ""taco bell problems"") suggests this is part of a broader context of humorously discussing taco bell-related experiences.

these elements combine to create a statement that's not meant to be taken literally, but rather to humorously comment on how small comforts can feel disproportionately satisfying when you're not feeling your best.",1

1. the phrase ""perfect time"" is used ironically, as there's never really a perfect time to get sick.
2. the crying emoji (😢) contradicts the idea of it being a ""perfect time,"" emphasizing the speaker's disappointment or frustration.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to explicitly indicate sarcasm in social media posts. it negates the preceding statement, making it clear that the author means the opposite of what they initially said.

these elements, combined with the brief and informal nature of the text, strongly indicate that the statement is sarcastic rather than sincere.",1

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward comment or observation about setting personal goals, possibly related to relationships or attractiveness. while it uses informal language and social media conventions (hashtags, shortened url), there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the tone seems casual and direct rather than ironic or mocking. the use of hashtags like #hot or #not is common in social media to categorize or rate content, and doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm in this context. without more context or a clearer contrast between the literal meaning and intended meaning, it's safer to interpret this as a non-sarcastic statement.",0
"Change is a Process, ||#Not an Event dafuq you thinking",0,"sarcastic

"A #sale is #not #something you #pursue, it's #what #happens to you #while you are #immersed in #serving your... http://t.co/ojFVxXxilw",0,"not sarcastic

the input text appears to be a genuine piece of advice or wisdom about sales philosophy, presented in a straightforward manner. the use of hashtags and the truncated nature of the text suggest it's a social media post, likely on twitter. the content itself is offering a perspective on how sales occur as a result of focusing on service, rather than pursuing sales directly.

the language used is direct and motivational, without any apparent irony or contradiction that would indicate sarcasm. the message aligns with common business advice that emphasizes customer service as a path to sales success. the incomplete nature of the sentence and the included url link further support that this is a sincere attempt to share a sales insight or lead readers to more information on the topic.

given these factors, the text does not exhibit characteristics of sarcasm, and thus the appropriate label is ""not sarcastic.""",0
"@zainabimam ""Malala is fake and planted by the US coz Pakistan is perfectly safe for kids going to school"" #PeshawarAttack #Sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

Yay jury duty 😒 #sarcasm,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this label is appropriate because:

2. the rolling eyes emoji (😒) directly contradicts the seemingly positive ""yay,"" reinforcing the sarcastic tone.
3. the explicit use of the hashtag #sarcasm leaves no doubt about the intended sarcastic nature of the statement.
4. the combination of casual language (""yay"") with digital elements (emoji, hashtag) is typical of sarcastic expression in social media contexts.
5. jury duty is often considered an inconvenience, making enthusiasm about it likely to be sarcastic.

all these elements clearly point to the text being sarcastic rather than sincere.",1

Literally functioning on 4 hours of sleep and I feel great 😄 !! #Not #CollegeisKillingMe #OneMoreWeek,1,"label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. the contrast between ""4 hours of sleep"" and ""feeling great"" is unrealistic and likely intended ironically.
2. the use of ""literally"" and the overly enthusiastic ""!!"" further exaggerate the statement, hinting at sarcasm.
3. the smiling emoji (😄) in this context is probably used sarcastically to emphasize the irony of the situation.
4. the hashtags directly contradict the main statement:
   - ""#not"" explicitly negates the claim of feeling great.
   - ""#collegeiskillingme"" reveals the true negative sentiment.
   - ""#onemoreweek"" suggests the person is struggling and counting down to the end.

these elements together create a sarcastic tone, where the speaker is actually expressing exhaustion and difficulty with college life while pretending to be fine on little sleep.",1

has anyone visualised the different colours and flavours of twitter streams? kinda lipmus test.,0,"not sarcastic

1. the contrast between the seemingly positive description (""blue skies, warm air, and the royal accommodation!"") and the hashtags, especially ""#not...""

2. the use of ""#whatmoredoesoneneed"" is likely meant ironically, suggesting that the described situation is actually undesirable or insufficient.

3. the inclusion of ""#education?"" followed by ""#not..."" implies that education is conspicuously absent or lacking in this situation, despite the seemingly pleasant surroundings.

4. the overall tone and structure of the tweet suggest that the author is criticizing a situation where superficial comforts are present, but important elements (like education) are missing.

the sarcasm is used to highlight a discrepancy between appearance and reality, or to criticize misplaced priorities. therefore, the correct label for this tweet is ""sarcastic"".",1

Sweet jeebus! MT @NWSOPC CryoSat & Jason-2 confirm very high to phenomenal seas generated by North Atlantic low http://t.co/Y4JmUbLJpa,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the reason for this label is the juxtaposition of the excited exclamation ""sweet jeebus!"" with the serious and potentially dangerous weather information that follows. the use of such an exaggerated, informal expression in response to a scientific weather report about extreme sea conditions creates a sarcastic tone. the speaker is likely not genuinely excited about the dangerous weather, but rather using sarcasm to comment on the severity or unusualness of the situation.",1
Hyper at 1AM when I really should be getting rest #ohwhale 🐋🐳,0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the contrast between being ""hyper at 1am"" and the acknowledgment that the person ""really should be getting rest"" highlights the irony of the situation.

2. the use of ""#ohwhale"" is a deliberate misspelling and pun on ""oh well,"" which is often used sarcastically to express mock resignation or indifference to an undesirable situation.

3. the whale emojis (🐋🐳) further emphasize the wordplay and add to the sarcastic tone.

this combination of irony, wordplay, and casual acceptance of a less-than-ideal circumstance (being energetic when sleep is needed) strongly indicates that the text is meant to be read as sarcastic.",1
"We were miles apart,but you found me, now we are close enough, still apart #irony",1,"based on the given context and the content of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

the reasons for this label are:

1. the use of the hashtag #irony at the end of the statement explicitly signals the author's intention to convey sarcasm or irony.

2. the content of the text presents a paradoxical situation: the people described have become emotionally closer (""now we are close enough"") but remain physically separated (""still apart""). this contradiction is a common feature of sarcastic or ironic statements.

3. the structure of the statement builds up to a unexpected twist at the end, which is a typical format for sarcastic comments.

4. the brief context provided mentions that the author finds this situation paradoxical or contrary to expectations, which aligns with the use of sarcasm to highlight this irony.

therefore, considering these elements, the label ""sarcastic"" appears to be the most appropriate classification for this text.",1

#Analysis -- #Economic #issues #whip #up #Israelis #in #chocolate #pudding #election. http://t.co/5Fw5ymVB35 via @reuters,0,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the given cues and the input text, this appears to be a straightforward news headline or summary about economic issues in an israeli election. the mention of ""chocolate pudding"" is likely a reference to a specific economic topic or campaign issue, rather than an attempt at sarcasm.

the use of hashtags, the inclusion of a shortened url, and the attribution to reuters (@reuters) are typical of serious news reporting on social media platforms. the phrase ""whip up"" suggests that economic issues are causing significant discussion or concern among israeli voters, which is a common occurrence in elections.

while the ""chocolate pudding"" reference might seem unusual without context, it's more likely to be a genuine campaign talking point or economic indicator rather than a sarcastic comment. therefore, the most appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0

1. the use of hashtags like ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly negating the previous statement.

2. the phrase ""found my motivation... aka the back of my eye lids"" is a sarcastic way of saying they're sleeping or lazy instead of being motivated.

3. calling themselves ""winners"" followed by ""#not"" and ""#losers"" is a clear use of irony, a key component of sarcasm.

4. the hashtag ""#senioritisisreal"" suggests they're joking about their lack of motivation as seniors in school.

given the context and content of this input, i'm confident in labeling this as ""sarcastic."" the text demonstrates clear elements of sarcasm:

2. the use of hashtags ""#duh"" and ""#redundantredundant"" shows self-awareness of this redundancy, emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

3. the speaker is using this redundancy as a form of self-deprecating humor, which is a common sarcastic technique.

the combination of stating the obvious in an exaggerated way, followed by self-aware commentary via hashtags, strongly indicates a sarcastic intent. this fits well with the context of social media communication where such witty, self-referential comments are common.",1

this post appears to be a genuine expression of affection for a brother, despite their physical differences. the use of the heart emoji, affectionate hashtags like #family and #lovehim, and the overall positive tone suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm. the mention of not looking alike is likely a straightforward observation, not a sarcastic comment. the multilingual use (english and french) and informal style are typical of sincere social media posts expressing familial love.",0

@GalloSays at least there's a good football game on with zero chance of either of our teams losing lol,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

### label: sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the use of ""at least"" suggests a silver lining to an otherwise disappointing situation.
2. the phrase ""good football game"" is followed by ""with zero chance of either of our teams losing,"" which is impossible unless neither team is playing.
3. the ""lol"" at the end confirms the humorous and non-literal intent of the statement.

the sarcasm lies in the fact that the speaker is finding amusement in the idea that their teams can't lose if they're not playing, which is a playful way of dealing with the disappointment of their teams likely not being in an important game.",1

Forest Hills Drive on my playlist naw....,0,"based on the given cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label.

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""forest hills drive on my playlist naw...."" appears to be a straightforward, casual comment about the speaker's music preferences. they are directly stating that they don't have the album ""forest hills drive"" (likely referring to j. cole's ""2014 forest hills drive"") on their playlist. the use of ""naw"" (informal for ""no"") and the ellipsis at the end suggest a casual, conversational tone rather than a sarcastic one. there are no clear indicators of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems to be a simple expression of personal taste in music, delivered in an informal manner typical of social media or text messaging.",0

"@JeffDauler @Scottydons87 the cop also had prior misconduct charges. But, ya know, that's ok #sarcasm",1,"sarcastic

this tweet is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end, which explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic.
2. the phrase ""but, ya know, that's ok"" is used ironically to imply that it's actually not okay.

"Zuma reads the quote ""People are not fighting for ideas, they fight for material benefits. To live in peace."" #Irony #YCLNationalCongress",1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of the hashtag #irony in the tweet clearly indicates that the author intends the message to be interpreted sarcastically. the irony arises from the contrast between the content of the quote zuma is reading (about people fighting for material benefits and living in peace) and what is likely perceived as zuma's own actions or reputation, which may contradict these ideals. the sarcasm is further emphasized by presenting this quote in the context of zuma reading it at a political event (ycl national congress), suggesting a disconnect between the words being spoken and the reality of the situation.",1

"sony emails tells me a few things. wealthy, high powered business(wo)men are ugly people, stupid & need to learn how to spell. #SonyHack",0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcastic statements:

1. unexpected contrast: it juxtaposes the high status of ""wealthy, high powered business(wo)men"" with negative qualities like being ""ugly people"" and ""stupid,"" creating a satirical effect.

2. exaggeration: the sweeping generalization about all high-powered business people being ugly and stupid is likely an overstatement for effect.

3. informal tone: the casual language and use of a hashtag suggest a less serious, more satirical intent.

4. critical commentary: the statement is clearly critical of sony executives, using sarcasm to express disapproval of their leaked emails.

5. irony: there's an implied irony in suggesting that powerful business people ""need to learn how to spell,"" contrasting their perceived incompetence with their high status.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the statement is intended to be sarcastic, using humor and exaggeration to criticize the sony executives implicated in the email hack.",1

Love waking up to no heat in my apartment #not #socold,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""love"" at the beginning of the sentence is likely ironic, as waking up to no heat is generally not a pleasant experience.

2. the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, used to negate the preceding statement.

3. the hashtag ""#socold"" emphasizes the unpleasant situation, further supporting the sarcastic tone.

4. the keywords ""waking up,"" ""no heat,"" ""apartment,"" and ""cold"" all contribute to describing an undesirable situation, which contrasts with the initial positive sentiment ""love,"" indicating sarcasm.

therefore, the statement is clearly sarcastic, expressing frustration about the lack of heating in a cold apartment.",1

"Decided I'd go to bed ""early"" for once. I've been laying here since 2 am. Yet the total amount of sleep I've had all week is 10 hrs. #irony",1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. the author uses quotation marks around ""early,"" indicating that their attempt to go to bed early was not actually early by normal standards.

2. they mention lying awake since 2 am, which contradicts the idea of going to bed early and getting more sleep.

3. the statement about only getting 10 hours of sleep total for the entire week is extremely low, highlighting the irony of trying to go to bed early but still not getting enough sleep.

4. the use of the hashtag #irony at the end explicitly signals that the author is aware of and pointing out the ironic situation.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic tone, where the author is mocking their own failed attempt to improve their sleep habits. the contrast between the intention (going to bed early) and the reality (still not sleeping, very little sleep overall) is the essence of the sarcasm in this post.",1
I have a very annoying bluetick for sale. 8 yrs old. Needs babied and a bath. #sarcasm,0,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input for the following reasons:

1. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the text is a direct indicator that the author intends the message to be understood as sarcastic.

2. the description of the dog as ""very annoying"" and needing to be ""babied"" contrasts with the idea of trying to sell it, which is typically done by highlighting positive attributes.

3. mentioning that the dog ""needs babied and a bath"" as selling points is unconventional and likely meant to be humorous.

4. the presence of ""sarcasm"" in the extracted keywords further supports this interpretation.

the combination of these elements, especially the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag, makes it clear that the text is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine attempt to sell a dog.",1

2. while the use of ""amirite"" (am i right?) can sometimes indicate sarcasm, in this context it seems more likely to be seeking agreement or confirmation.
3. there are no clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically signal sarcasm.
4. the informal, conversational tone suggests a casual remark rather than a sarcastic statement.
5. the lack of emotional contrasts or strong emotional words further supports a non-sarcastic interpretation.

therefore, the text appears to be a simple, non-sarcastic comment or question about zach's profession as a teacher.",0

Someone tell me where tf to find a fried chicken ornament bc this shit is necessary http://t.co/lIqfhFe0Vl,0,"sarcastic

this tweet is likely sarcastic for a few reasons:

1. the exaggerated language: using ""tf"" (an abbreviation for a swear word) and calling a fried chicken ornament ""necessary"" suggests hyperbole.

2. the incongruity: fried chicken ornaments are not common or typically considered essential decorations, creating a humorous contrast.

3. the tone: the urgency expressed for such an unusual item implies a playful, non-serious attitude.

4. social media context: twitter is often a platform for witty, sarcastic comments, especially regarding unusual or trivial matters.

while the person might genuinely want a fried chicken ornament, the way they've phrased the request strongly suggests they're being sarcastic about its importance or necessity, likely for comedic effect.",1

5. the overall tone seems light-hearted and curious (""let's see if..."") rather than mocking or sarcastic.

4. use of hashtags: #coyotes and #browns add context and amplify the sarcastic tone by referencing the teams these individuals are associated with.

5. unexpected punchline: the simultaneous exclamation subverts expectations and highlights the absurdity of their shared sentiment.

given these elements, the text is clearly using sarcasm to comment on the tendency of sports figures to deflect blame for poor team performance.",1

"Scoped out a new route on today's 5k. But oh.. the crowds, the traffic, the noise 😄 #not... http://t.co/yYGdZiRwfZ",1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""but oh..."" followed by complaints about crowds, traffic, and noise suggests a contrast with the initial positive statement about scoping out a new route.

2. the emoji 😄 (smiling face) is used in a context where the author is listing negative aspects, which is often a sarcastic technique.

3. the use of ""#not..."" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this hashtag is commonly used to negate the preceding statement, revealing that the author actually means the opposite of what they initially said.

4. the contrast between the seemingly positive act of finding a new route for a 5k run and the subsequent complaints about urban inconveniences further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

final labs coursework submitted!! now to treat myself by catching up with the whole semester's lectures #winning #not,1,"sarcastic

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm, particularly through the use of ""#winning"" immediately followed by ""#not"". this juxtaposition is a classic sarcastic technique, where the author initially presents a positive statement and then immediately contradicts or undermines it. 

the overall tone of the message is self-deprecating humor. the author is celebrating finishing their coursework, but then sarcastically frames catching up on a whole semester's worth of lectures as a ""treat"". this contrast between the relief of submitting work and the daunting task ahead is further emphasized by the sarcastic use of ""#winning"".

the informal style, use of multiple exclamation marks, and the hashtags all contribute to the casual, social media-like context where sarcasm is often employed. the lack of capitalization also adds to the informal, offhand nature of the comment, which is often associated with sarcastic remarks in online communication.

therefore, based on these cues and the overall context, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this text.",1

sarcastic

@CeciAlbiceleste @MarinaOLoughlin #apologies *scoffs humble pie*,0,"sarcastic

the text exhibits subtle indicators of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""#apologies"" followed immediately by ""*scoffs humble pie*"" creates an ironic contrast. while ostensibly apologizing, the action of ""scoffing"" humble pie suggests insincerity or reluctance.

2. the phrase ""humble pie"" itself is often used sarcastically, especially when paired with an action like ""scoffs,"" which implies disdain or mockery.

3. the use of asterisks to dramatize the action adds a performative element that can be interpreted as overplaying the apology for comedic or sarcastic effect.

4. the overall brevity and casual tone of the tweet, combined with these elements, suggest a playful or sarcastic interaction rather than a genuine, heartfelt apology.

while subtle, these cues together point towards a sarcastic interpretation of the apology, making ""sarcastic"" the most appropriate label for this text.",1

3. the use of capitalization in ""dont"" emphasizes the negative sentiment in a way that often indicates sarcasm.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the tweet contains clear indicators of sarcasm:

4. the juxtaposition of trying to post an article about an important figure (madiba) while being hindered by mundane technical issues adds to the sarcastic tone.

@KateOnTheGo Things also go slowly when you are waiting for them especially!,0,"sarcastic

the text appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. irony: the statement plays on the common frustration of time seeming to move slowly when waiting for something, exaggerating this feeling by emphasizing it with ""especially!""

2. exaggeration: the use of ""especially!"" at the end adds emphasis that feels somewhat over-the-top, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic statements.

Mondaiiis to fridaiis without Huweyyyyyy #do #NOT #like http://t.co/eY6n4SeS9M,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. unusual spelling: the use of ""mondaiiis"" and ""fridaiis"" instead of standard spellings suggests a playful or exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.

2. emotional contrast: while the text explicitly states dislike, the exaggerated spelling and use of ""huweyyyyyy"" (likely a person's name) imply a more complex emotional state than simple dislike.

3. hashtag usage: the separated hashtags ""#do #not #like"" emphasize the sentiment in a way that seems deliberately overemphasized, which is common in sarcastic expressions.

4. social media context: the shortened url and hashtag usage indicate this is a tweet, where sarcasm is frequently employed for humor or to make a point.

5. implicit meaning: the statement implies that weekdays are only bearable with ""huweyyyyyy,"" which could be an ironic or sarcastic way of expressing affection or dependency.

2. the use of the exclamation mark adds emphasis that could be interpreted as overly dramatic for such a mundane task, hinting at sarcasm.

3. the hashtag ""#screwyousmallparkinglot"" is a clear indicator of frustration, but expressed in a humorous and exaggerated way. the use of ""screw you"" directed at an inanimate object (the parking lot) is a common sarcastic device.

4. the contrast between the formal-sounding ""hardest parking"" and the informal, angry hashtag creates a juxtaposition that is often used in sarcastic statements.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their frustration with a difficult parking experience in a humorous way, rather than making a sincere statement about it being the absolute hardest parking they've ever done.",1

"I'm officially making today ""Single men get a smoothie"" day because that's who my customers have been all day.",0,"based on the provided cues and context, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the text displays characteristics of sarcasm for the following reasons:

1. the use of ""officially"" in this casual context creates a humorous contrast between the speaker's lack of actual authority to declare an official day and their playful declaration.

2. the specificity of ""single men get a smoothie day"" is an exaggerated and absurd concept, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

3. the explanation ""because that's who my customers have been all day"" reveals that this isn't a pre-planned event, but rather an impromptu and humorous observation about their customer base for the day.

4. the overall tone suggests a lighthearted, joking manner rather than a serious declaration, which aligns with sarcastic expression.

this statement is a playful, sarcastic comment on an observed pattern in the speaker's workday, rather than a genuine attempt to create a special day for single men to get smoothies.",1

"#Irony: ""The elections are not over zero VAT, but about whether there will be a Zionist or extremist country here"". http://t.co/SxRoXLVspP",1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tweet begins with ""#irony:"", which is a clear indicator that the following statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically.

2. the content of the tweet presents a stark contrast between two options (zionist vs. extremist country), which is a common structure for sarcastic statements.

3. the cues mention that the debate is indeed about zionist and extremist ideologies, not about vat policy. this aligns with the content of the tweet, supporting the sarcastic nature of the statement.

4. the use of quotation marks around the statement suggests that the author is quoting someone else's words, potentially to mock or criticize the perspective being presented.

given these factors, it's clear that the tweet is using sarcasm to comment on the israeli elections and the underlying ideological debate, rather than presenting a straightforward statement about vat policy.",1
Katie pisses me off so bad #TheApprentice,0,"not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a direct and genuine expression of frustration or anger towards someone named katie, likely in the context of the tv show ""the apprentice."" the language used is straightforward and emotionally charged, without any indicators of irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm. the use of strong language (""pisses me off"") and the hashtag ""#theapprentice"" further support that this is a sincere expression of negative feelings. therefore, based on the given information and context, this statement is best labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0

Rest in peace riff God! #Dimebag #Darrell #is #not #dead #pantera,0,"sarcastic

the text appears to be employing sarcasm by juxtaposing contradictory sentiments. the phrase ""rest in peace"" is typically used to acknowledge someone's death, while the hashtags ""#is #not #dead"" directly contradict this. this intentional contrast is a common feature of sarcastic expressions.

the reference to dimebag darrell, a famous guitarist who passed away, adds context. the sarcasm likely stems from fans' sentiment that his musical legacy lives on, even though he has physically died. the use of ""riff god"" further emphasizes his lasting impact on music.

the hashtag style and exclamation point also contribute to a tone that feels less somber and more playful or provocative, which is consistent with sarcastic intent.

therefore, based on these elements, the label ""sarcastic"" seems most appropriate for this text.",1

John Stockton in a commercial?!! Holy crap! #NBABallot,0,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this tweet.

2. the exclamation ""holy crap!"" further emphasizes an unexpected or shocking event.
3. the cues mention that john stockton appearing in a commercial seems surprising or unexpected to the author, which aligns with the tone of the tweet.
4. the combination of exaggerated surprise and the generally mundane nature of a retired athlete appearing in a commercial suggests the author is using sarcasm to comment on this event.

the sarcastic tone implies that john stockton appearing in a commercial is not actually as shocking or noteworthy as the tweet dramatically suggests, likely poking fun at the situation or the rarity of stockton's media appearances.",1

@robinhosking where did THAT come from?!,0,not sarcastic,0
Somebody has filled my head with snot & used a cheese grater on the back of my throat during the night #unimpressed,0,"sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using exaggerated and absurd imagery to describe their cold or flu symptoms, which is a common technique in sarcastic expression. the phrase ""somebody has filled my head with snot & used a cheese grater on the back of my throat during the night"" is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous and hyperbolic way of expressing how awful they feel. 

the use of the hashtag #unimpressed at the end further reinforces the sarcastic tone, as it's an understated reaction to what is described as a rather extreme situation. this contrast between the dramatic description and the mild reaction adds to the sarcastic effect.

therefore, based on the exaggerated language, the absurd imagery, and the contrasting hashtag, this text can confidently be labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1

sarcastic

this text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the suggestion of killing kids with drone strikes is an extreme and morally reprehensible action, which is unlikely to be sincerely proposed.

2. the phrase ""cause that strategy seems to b working so well"" is a sarcastic way of saying the opposite - implying that such a strategy is actually not working well at all.

3. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a common way to explicitly mark sarcasm on social media platforms, indicating that the preceding statement should be interpreted as the opposite of what was said.

4. the casual tone and abbreviated language (""b"" instead of ""be"") combined with the serious subject matter also contributes to the sarcastic tone.

these factors strongly indicate that the text is intended to be read as sarcastic criticism of drone strike policies, rather than a sincere proposal.",1
"Get on the work bus, driver turns his music on and the first song on is 'another day in paradise' #irony",1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i would assign the label:

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of hashtags like ""#jk"" (just kidding) and ""#stilljk"" (still just kidding) clearly indicate that the speaker is not being serious.

"Absolutely no #ALP or @jrobertsonmp fan, but seriously many have done this before him & many will. #Scapegoat #Excuse he was a lame duck",0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the text exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. it starts with ""absolutely no #alp or @jrobertsonmp fan, but..."" which is a classic sarcastic setup, where the speaker pretends to distance themselves from the subject before defending them.

2. the use of ""seriously"" followed by a statement that downplays the significance of the person's actions is a sarcastic technique to mock the outrage or attention given to the situation.

3. the hashtags #scapegoat and #excuse are used ironically to suggest that the person is being unfairly blamed or used as an excuse.

4. the final description of the person as a ""lame duck"" is a dismissive term that adds to the overall sarcastic tone.

the author is using sarcasm to criticize the treatment of @jrobertsonmp while simultaneously expressing their own negative view of both the politician and the party. the sarcastic tone is used to highlight what the author sees as hypocrisy or overreaction in the political discourse.",1

the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end of the tweet explicitly confirms the sarcastic intent. the author is using this observation to highlight the contradictory nature of people's actions versus their words, which is a common technique in sarcastic commentary.

the emotional contrasts and irony identified in the current cues further support this interpretation, making it evident that the text is meant to be read as a sarcastic observation about human behavior during hazardous weather conditions.",1

It's all about Twitter #not a clue,0,"sarcastic

the input text ""it's all about twitter #not a clue"" is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

2. irony: the use of the hashtag ""#not a clue"" is ironic when paired with the confident-sounding statement about twitter. this irony is a hallmark of sarcasm.

3. social media context: the mention of twitter and use of a hashtag suggests familiarity with social media, making it more likely that the speaker is using social media conventions (like hashtags) to convey sarcasm.

4. informal tone: the casual, conversational tone is often conducive to sarcastic expressions.

5. rhetorical device: as noted in the cues, the hashtag is used as a rhetorical device to contradict the preceding statement, which is a common sarcastic technique.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a sarcastic comment about the perceived importance or complexity of twitter, while simultaneously expressing confusion or critique about it.",1

3. internet slang and emoticons: the use of ""xp"" (a laughing face emoticon) and ""lol"" (laugh out loud) indicates that the author is not being serious and is making light of their situation.

given these cues, the text is clearly meant to be read as a sarcastic comment on social expectations and the author's self-perceived social status, rather than a genuine expression of desire to change or concern about rejection.",1

label: not sarcastic

the input text aligns closely with the common knowledge presented in the cues. it expresses the idea that friendships cannot be forced or artificially influenced, which is consistent with the notion that ""friendships require natural affinity and cannot be forced."" the text directly states that ""friendships aren't progressed this way"" (referring to exerting influence or change) and emphasizes that ""some natural affinity is needed."" this matches the idea that friendships develop organically rather than through deliberate efforts to change or control them.

the tweet appears to be a straightforward description of a christmas sweater design, without any apparent sarcasm or irony. the phrase ""not so ugly"" suggests the sweater is meant to be more attractive than typical ""ugly"" christmas sweaters, but this is likely a genuine description rather than a sarcastic comment. the all-caps text and hashtag use are common in social media posts for emphasis and discoverability, not necessarily indicators of sarcasm. the content seems to be promoting or sharing information about a specific christmas sweater design, which is consistent with typical, non-sarcastic social media behavior.",0

almost 72 hs of a kid asking for his christmas gift and zero answers from @AskPlayStation thank you guys! you are awesome #not,1,"sarcastic

the text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the excessively positive language (""thank you guys! you are awesome"") contrasts sharply with the described poor customer service experience.

2. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a classic sarcastic device, explicitly negating the preceding positive statement.

3. the context of waiting 72 hours for a response about a child's christmas gift adds emotional weight, making the sarcastic tone more biting.

1. the use of exaggerated praise (""i do hope you ... will sleep better"") in a context that clearly disapproves of the subject's actions.

Making the most out of my last vacation day. #not #tvandsleep,1,"based on the provided input and cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of hashtags, particularly ""#not"", is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the ""#not"" tag is commonly used to negate the preceding statement in a sarcastic manner.

2. the contrast between ""making the most out of my last vacation day"" and ""#tvandsleep"" creates irony. typically, people don't consider watching tv and sleeping as making the most of a vacation day.

3. the structure of the sentence, where the main statement is followed by contradictory hashtags, is a common pattern used in sarcastic social media posts.

these elements combined strongly suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic about how they're spending their last vacation day, implying that they're actually not making the most of it at all.",1

So restaurants that thrive on the social nature of eating believe that mothers should only breastfeed in private? #irony,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end is a strong indicator, as it explicitly signals the author's intent. additionally, the content of the statement itself highlights the contradiction between restaurants as social spaces and the suggestion that breastfeeding (a natural and necessary act for mothers and babies) should be done in private. this juxtaposition creates irony, which is a common element of sarcasm.

the keywords extracted, especially ""irony,"" further support this classification. the combination of ""restaurants,"" ""social eating,"" ""mothers,"" ""breastfeed,"" and ""private"" in one statement sets up the contrast that forms the basis of the sarcastic comment.",1
This long drive home later in the snow is gonna be shweeeet #not,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. the key indicators are:

1. the use of ""shweeeet"" (an exaggerated spelling of ""sweet"") to describe a long drive home in the snow, which is typically not an enjoyable experience.

2. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to explicitly denote sarcasm in social media posts. it contradicts the preceding statement, making it clear that the author actually means the opposite of what they said.

3. the overall tone of the message, combining the prospect of a difficult drive (long, in snow) with a seemingly positive description (""shweeeet""), creates an ironic contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm.

these elements, along with the informal language and social media style, strongly support the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1

label: not sarcastic

this statement appears to be a genuine piece of advice or motivational message. the use of metaphor, personification, and the rule of three are employed to emphasize the importance of letting go of the past and looking forward to the future. the hashtag #bringon2015 further reinforces the positive, forward-looking sentiment. while sarcasm can sometimes employ similar devices, the overall message here seems sincere and meant to be taken at face value as encouragement rather than as a sarcastic comment.",0

#NOT ALL 👌 There good & bad in every occupation & race 📚📖 #Stop Labeling #Not All 💡 http://t.co/CMoOOnNGQi,0,"not sarcastic

the text appears to be a sincere message advocating against stereotyping and generalizations. here's why i believe it's not sarcastic:

1. consistent message: the content consistently promotes the idea of not labeling entire groups, which aligns with the hashtags used.

2. use of emojis: the emojis (👌💡📚📖) are used to emphasize and illustrate the points being made, not to convey irony.

3. straightforward language: the text uses clear, direct language to convey its message without any apparent irony or contradiction.

4. educational tone: the use of book emojis and the light bulb emoji suggests an attempt to educate or enlighten, which is consistent with a genuine message.

5. common anti-discrimination rhetoric: the message aligns with common arguments against prejudice and discrimination, suggesting sincerity rather than sarcasm.

6. lack of exaggeration or absurdity: there are no extreme claims or absurd statements that might indicate sarcasm.

given these factors, the text appears to be a genuine attempt to promote a message of avoiding stereotypes and recognizing individual differences within groups, rather than a sarcastic statement.",0
