 PENNY: That sounds interesting.
 HOWARD: You'll think about it?
",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

the statement ""i don't think i'll be able to stop thinking about it"" is a straightforward expression of concern or preoccupation. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this context. the language is direct and sincere, expressing genuine worry or inability to stop thinking about something. the use of ""i don't think"" and the personal nature of the statement further reinforce that this is likely a honest expression of penny's feelings, rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0
"SHELDON: Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.","LEONARD: Here we go. Pad thai, no peanuts.
 HOWARD: But does it have peanut oil?
 LEONARD: I'm not sure. Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement contains situational irony, offering epinephrine (typically used for severe allergic reactions like bee stings) when it's not bee season.
2. the dry humor and matter-of-fact tone in offering a potentially life-saving medication casually suggest a sarcastic intent.
3. the incongruity between the seriousness of epinephrine's purpose and the casual way it's offered implies sarcasm.
4. sheldon's character, as described in the cues, seems to have a deadpan or detached way of communicating, which often aligns with sarcastic humor.
5. the statement subverts expectations by treating a serious medical item as something casual to give away when it's not immediately needed.

while the sarcasm is subtle, the combination of irony, dry humor, and the casual treatment of a serious topic strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

 PENNY: Yes, I know, men can't fly.
 SHELDON: Let's assume that they can.
",BBT,0,"after considering the context and content, i can confidently provide a label for this input:

label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. it takes a familiar superhero scenario and subverts expectations by applying real-world physics to comically dark effect. the matter-of-fact tone in describing lois lane's gruesome fate contrasts sharply with the typical heroic rescue, creating a darkly humorous and sarcastic take on the superman mythos. this is consistent with sheldon's character (likely from ""the big bang theory""), known for his literal interpretations and lack of social awareness when discussing hypothetical scenarios.",1.0

 SHELDON: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.
",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

this statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's using a humorous and exaggerated comparison to point out that there are likely many items cluttered on the coffee table. the sarcasm lies in the absurd image of a coffee table hosting a ""tiny garage sale,"" which is obviously not literally possible. this kind of witty, hyperbolic observation is a classic example of sarcasm, especially characteristic of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory"".",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the input text appears to be a straightforward line of dialogue from a fictional work, likely a tv show or movie. howard is posing a hypothetical scenario to sheldon about him potentially being a robot without knowing it. this kind of speculative question is common in science fiction or comedy contexts and doesn't inherently contain sarcasm. the statement is presented as a genuine, though incomplete, thought rather than a sarcastic remark. without additional context suggesting a mocking or ironic tone, it's most appropriate to classify this as not sarcastic.",0.0
"SHELDON: If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.","SHELDON: Oh, good Lord.
 LEONARD: God, that's a good song.
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement from sheldon contains clear sarcastic elements:

1. the comment about a ""mix cd for a double suicide"" is an exaggerated, dark humorous way to criticize someone's music taste.

2. the follow-up remark about hoping the scratching post is for the person he's talking to is a sarcastic jab, implying the person is cat-like or should use it themselves.

these elements, combined with the character sheldon's known tendency for sarcasm and biting remarks (if this is indeed from ""the big bang theory"" as the name suggests), strongly indicate that this dialogue is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0
SHELDON: No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.,"LEONARD: How do I look?
 SHELDON: Could you be more specific?
 LEONARD: Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement from sheldon is clearly sarcastic. the context and the way it's phrased strongly suggest sarcasm:

1. the use of ""nicely"" at the end is ironic, as dark underarm stains are generally considered unattractive or embarrassing.

2. sheldon is known for his blunt and often socially inappropriate comments in the show ""the big bang theory"". this type of remark is characteristic of his sarcastic or unintentionally insulting observations.

3. the detailed description (""dark crescent-shaped patterns"") adds to the sarcastic tone by drawing attention to something the other person would likely prefer to ignore.

4. the statement appears to be a response to someone asking if something is noticeable, and sheldon's reply sarcastically confirms that it is indeed very noticeable while pretending to say it isn't.

given these factors, this statement is confidently labeled as ""sarcastic"".",1.0

 PENNY: Yeah, you, too.

",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic. leonard is using irony to imply that his parents' choices (his name and academic placement) actually made him more of a target for bullying, rather than helping him. the sarcasm lies in the idea that his parents' decisions, which were likely intended to benefit him, had the opposite effect of making his social life more difficult.",1.0

 LEONARD: The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using dark humor and an exaggerated, callous attitude to make a point. the suggestion to ""cut the foreigner in half"" is not meant literally, but rather to highlight an uncaring or xenophobic attitude. the follow-up about ""a billion more"" further emphasizes this sarcastic tone, treating people as disposable and interchangeable. this kind of dark, exaggerated statement is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like immigration or treatment of foreigners.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuine expression of excitement and wonder from sheldon. he is sincerely amazed at seeing someone who closely resembles a fictional character he's familiar with from a book. the language used, such as ""exactly like"" and ""how often does one see..."", conveys genuine enthusiasm rather than sarcasm. the cues also support this interpretation, noting sheldon's excitement and the rarity of such a resemblance. there are no indicators of irony or mockery that would suggest sarcasm in this statement.",0.0

",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

this line appears to be a straightforward statement from the character sheldon, likely referring to sabbath observance practices. while sheldon's character is often known for sarcasm, this particular statement doesn't show clear signs of sarcasm. it's a matter-of-fact observation about powering down on saturdays, probably in the context of a discussion about technology use and religious practices. the tone seems informative rather than sarcastic, so i'm confident in labeling this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided input and context, i can confidently assign the following label:

### label:

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is using hyperbole and absurd logic (the spontaneous formation of a trash can) to contrast with the simpler, more obvious explanation suggested by occam's razor (that someone simply threw the letter out). this juxtaposition of an extremely unlikely scenario with a common-sense one is a classic form of sarcasm, especially characteristic of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory.""",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe i can reliably determine that this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the context suggests leonard is genuinely explaining a technical feature or property.
2. the enthusiasm indicated by the exclamation mark seems genuine rather than mocking.
3. there's no apparent irony or contradiction between what's said and what's meant.
4. the language style is straightforward and informative, typical of sincere technical explanations.
5. the build-up to revealing the reversibility suggests leonard finds this feature genuinely interesting or important.

while sarcasm can be subtle, there are no clear indicators of sarcastic intent in this brief statement. leonard appears to be sincerely pointing out a positive attribute of whatever he's discussing.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement exhibits several characteristics that point towards sarcasm:

1. the use of irony, as noted in the cues, suggests that penny doesn't actually find the situation ""weird"" but is implying something else.

2. the phrase ""that is so weird"" is often used sarcastically to indicate that something is not actually surprising or coincidental, but rather expected or deliberate.

3. the contrast between ""yours came and mine didn't"" sets up a perfect scenario for sarcasm, implying unfairness or intentional exclusion.

4. the informal, conversational tone and use of ""oh, you know"" at the beginning often preface sarcastic remarks in casual speech.

5. the overall context suggests that penny is likely expressing frustration or suspicion about why she didn't receive something while the other person did, using sarcasm to convey her feelings indirectly.

therefore, considering these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this statement.",1.0

the question asked by sheldon appears to be a straightforward inquiry without any apparent sarcastic undertones. the context suggests that sheldon is genuinely wondering if penny will come to take care of them, likely in a situation where they need assistance. there are no clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradictory elements that would typically signal sarcasm. the tone seems to be one of sincere curiosity or hope, which is consistent with a non-sarcastic interpretation of the dialogue.",0.0

sarcastic

the statement ""sell it on ebay as 'slightly used'"" is clearly meant to be humorous and ironic, especially given the context that this is likely referring to something that shouldn't be described as ""slightly used"" when sold. this kind of exaggeration and understated description of potentially very used or damaged items as ""slightly used"" is a common form of sarcasm, particularly in the context of online marketplaces like ebay.",1.0

sarcastic

this dialogue is clearly meant to be humorous in a satirical or ironic way, portraying howard's character as inappropriately opportunistic. the sarcasm lies in the sudden shift from seemingly sincere advice to an inappropriate suggestion, which is not meant to be taken seriously but rather to highlight the character's flaws or the absurdity of the situation.",1.0

 LEONARD: There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle
",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and my analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's using exaggerated language and false sincerity to express his dissatisfaction with the quantity being described as ""plenty."" the suggestion to notify the oxford english dictionary is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to emphasize how strongly he disagrees with the use of ""plenty"" in this context. this type of hyperbolic, deadpan delivery is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially for the character sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" who is known for such remarks.",1.0

1. the statement is straightforward and positive, expressing a sincere opinion about the night's events.
2. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that typically signal sarcasm.
3. the language style is described as formal, polite, and reflective, which aligns more with sincerity than sarcasm.

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of sheldon's unwillingness to attend a renaissance fair. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory tone. the use of ""i'm sorry"" at the beginning suggests sincerity rather than sarcasm. the formal structure of ""i am not going"" further reinforces the impression of a genuine, non-sarcastic statement.",0.0

based on the available information and context cues, this statement appears to be straightforward and not sarcastic. sheldon is directly acknowledging clarity in communication, both from the person he's addressing and from others present. the language style is described as formal, precise, and assertive, which aligns with a non-sarcastic, matter-of-fact statement. without additional context indicating tonal shifts or contradictory elements, it's reasonable to conclude that sheldon is genuinely affirming the clarity of the communication he received.",0.0

sarcastic

the statement by howard is clearly sarcastic. he's using exaggeration and contrast to highlight the perceived unfairness in his workplace. the comparison between someone else getting an assistant while he supposedly has to resort to extreme measures (going to a bank with wire cutters) just to get a pen is a classic example of sarcastic humor used to express frustration with workplace inequality.",1.0

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

my judgment is that this statement is indeed sarcastic. the context provided and the nature of the comment strongly suggest that sheldon is not sincerely proposing to include an inhaler with his publication. instead, he's likely making a sardonic remark about someone's dramatic or exaggerated reaction to his work. the suggestion of including an inhaler implies that the reaction was so intense that it might cause breathing difficulties, which is an exaggeration used for comedic effect. this kind of dry, deadpan humor is characteristic of sarcasm, especially coming from a character like sheldon.",1.0

the statement is clearly sarcastic because:

1. howard is making light of his mother's chlorine sensitivity by suggesting it's ""lucky"" for her.
2. he's using exaggerated and unflattering descriptors (""pruny and bug-eyed"") to describe fashion models, which is the opposite of how models are typically portrayed.
3. the juxtaposition of his mother's sensitivity with his supposed preference for models affected by chlorine creates a humorous and absurd situation, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

the input text displays clear sarcasm. howard's response ""where do you think? on mars!"" is a sarcastic retort to what was likely a question about his location. the contrast between the realistic location (a highway near bakersfield) and the absurd suggestion of being on mars is a classic sarcastic technique. the exasperated tone and use of an impossible location (mars) to emphasize the obviousness of the answer strongly indicates sarcasm.",1.0

the statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's making a sardonic remark about someone potentially ending up in federal prison, which is not a genuinely ""nice"" situation. the suggestion of carpooling to prison visits is a darkly humorous way of emphasizing the seriousness or illegality of whatever action was being discussed previously. this kind of dry, biting humor is characteristic of sarcasm, especially when framed as a seemingly positive comment (""how nice"") followed by a clearly negative implication.",1.0

### explanation:
based on the given cues and the input text, i can confidently label this statement as ""not sarcastic."" here's why:

1. the statement is straightforward and informative, providing factual details about the origin of an item (presumably the subject of conversation).

2. there's no evident emotional contrast or conflicting feelings in the text, which are often hallmarks of sarcasm.

3. the language used is formal and direct, consistent with sheldon's character (if this is from a tv show context), who is known for being literal and precise in his speech.

4. there are no rhetorical devices or figurative language that might suggest a sarcastic tone.

5. the context provided (receiving a birthday gift from an aunt) is a common and typically sincere situation, not one that would naturally lend itself to sarcasm.

6. the punctuation and structure of the sentence are straightforward, without any indicators (like exaggeration or emphasis) that might suggest sarcasm.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic response providing information about the origin of a gift sheldon received from his aunt marion on his 12th birthday.",0.0

 SHELDON: What?
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text uses formal medical language and a professional tone, consistent with a doctor speaking to a patient.
2. the statement is direct and factual, describing a medical observation.
3. there's no indication of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
4. the expression of surprise (""i've never seen anything like it"") appears genuine and reinforces the severity of the medical condition.

There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
 LEONARD: Come on, it's just a video game. And we suck at it.
 SHELDON: Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
 SHELDON: Where were you?
",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of ""bff"" (best friends forever) by howard seems exaggerated and mocking, especially when referring to adult relationships.
2. the cues indicate a contrast between the friendly term ""bff"" and a likely negative or jealous tone from howard.
3. the context suggests this is dialogue from a sitcom, where sarcasm is often employed for comedic effect.
4. the rhetorical devices identified, particularly sarcasm and implied comparison, strongly support a sarcastic interpretation.
5. howard's comment implies he's not genuinely happy about leonard's new friendship, but rather expressing his displeasure through sarcasm.

therefore, the statement ""sounds like leonard's got a new bff"" is clearly sarcastic in this context.",1.0
"RAJ: If you don't like this stuff, let's go next door and build her a bear.","HOWARD: You're kidding. You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps. That's the estrogen hat trick.

 PENNY: Dave was just showing me around the university. This place is unbelievable!
 LEONARD: I know, I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the context and cues strongly suggest this line is sarcastic. leonard's response implies he likely didn't mishear anything, but is using this statement to deflect or make light of a situation. the phrase ""a lot of words sound like 'yoga'"" is particularly indicative of sarcasm, as it's an exaggeration used for humorous effect. the informal tone and conversational style also support this interpretation. while the sarcasm is subtle, it's consistent with the kind of witty, deadpan humor often found in sitcom dialogue.",1.0

 SHELDON: I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friend-making.
",BBT,1,"based on the analysis provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the dialogue clearly demonstrates sarcasm through leonard's exaggerated and absurd suggestion. the use of hyperbole (""lie down on the floor and swim there"") to mock an unstated situation is a classic hallmark of sarcastic speech. the tone is mocking and the suggestion is intentionally ridiculous, which are key indicators of sarcasm in this context.",1.0

"PENNY: When I didn't pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.","LEONARD: Hey.
 PENNY: Hey.
 LEONARD: A little mood lighting, huh?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. penny is using irony and wordplay to describe a negative situation (having her power cut off due to an unpaid bill) in a humorous way. she sarcastically implies that the department of water and power did her a favor by creating ""ambience"" (darkness) when they cut off her electricity. this use of sarcasm to make light of a potentially stressful situation is a classic example of sarcastic humor.",1.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the tone of leonard's statement seems teasing or mischievous, encouraging someone to reveal potentially embarrassing information about others.

2. the phrase ""there's no hurry"" followed by an encouragement to elaborate on a sensitive topic (secret love) suggests a playful, ironic tone.

3. the context indicates that leonard may be trying to create an awkward situation by exposing a secret, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic or teasing behavior.

4. the casual, informal language style combined with the subject matter (revealing others' secret feelings) implies a sarcastic or joking intent rather than a sincere request for information.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect in written text without additional context or vocal cues, the combination of elements in this dialogue strongly suggests a sarcastic tone.",1.0

 PERSON: The big wet ball of death.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the sentence appears to be a genuine rhetorical question, designed to provoke thought or emphasize a point rather than express sarcasm.
2. the language style is casual and engaging, which is more indicative of sincere communication than sarcasm.
3. the emotional words ""feel"" and ""alive"" convey a sense of vitality and positive emotion, which aligns with a non-sarcastic interpretation.
4. there's no clear contrast or incongruity in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.
5. the use of ""kind of"" softens the statement, which is more characteristic of sincere speech than sarcastic remarks.

while sarcasm can be subtle, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this statement. it appears to be a genuine observation or question about an experience that is invigorating or life-affirming.",0.0

 HOWARD: You know the old saying, ""Pasty and frail never fail.""
",BBT,0,"based on my analysis of the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement by leonard appears to be a genuine expression of frustration or disappointment at being excluded from something. while the question ""why don't i get a shot?"" could be interpreted as slightly rhetorical, it doesn't contain the irony or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a straightforward complaint about feeling left out or overlooked. the tone and context suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm in leonard's request for inclusion or consideration.",0.0

 SHELDON: Does that sound like castanets to you?

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the rhetorical question format is a common sarcastic device.
2. the context mentions a ""sarcastic tone"" in the language style information.
3. sheldon is using an exaggerated analogy (cocaine smugglers) to make a point, which is a typical sarcastic technique.
4. the brevity and directness of the statement adds to its sarcastic impact.
5. the question is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather to highlight the absurdity of explicitly labeling something that's meant to be concealed or not openly identified.

therefore, this statement from sheldon is definitively sarcastic in nature.",1.0
LEONARD: Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.,"PERSON: Thanks so much for helping me.

 PENNY: You know this can go on all night.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement by leonard appears to be a straightforward suggestion or invitation. there's no indication of irony, mockery, or saying the opposite of what is meant, which are typical characteristics of sarcasm. leonard seems genuinely trying to resolve a situation by proposing a solution (joining the group). the tone, while possibly slightly exasperated, doesn't carry the hallmarks of sarcastic speech. the rhetorical question is used persuasively rather than sarcastically. therefore, this dialogue is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

 PENNY: Here, what about this one for my nephew?
 SHELDON: A superb choice.
 PENNY: Oh, great.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward conditional sentence without any obvious rhetorical devices or figurative language that might indicate sarcasm.
2. the language is described as formal and technical, which is consistent with sheldon's character (assuming this is sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"") and his typical way of speaking about topics he's knowledgeable about.
3. there are no emotional contrasts or emotional words that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the content relates to a specific topic (dc comics multiverse) and appears to be a genuine comment about the prerequisite knowledge needed to understand something related to it.
5. the tone is described as matter-of-fact, which aligns more with a sincere statement rather than a sarcastic one.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a genuine comment about the need for prior knowledge to understand a particular aspect of the dc multiverse, rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

 PERSON: Gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?
",BBT,1,"based on the provided context and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. penny's statement implies that there's a deeper or alternative meaning to ""coffee"" that the other person doesn't understand.

2. the phrase ""that is so sweet"" is often used sarcastically to indicate that someone's naivety or innocence is amusing or endearing, but not in a genuinely positive way.

3. the context suggests that penny is implying a hidden meaning, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.

4. the structure of the sentence, where penny repeats the word ""coffee"" with quotation marks, further emphasizes the sarcastic tone by suggesting that ""coffee"" means something other than its literal definition.

this combination of factors strongly indicates that penny's statement is intended to be sarcastic, poking fun at the other person's apparent lack of understanding about a potentially euphemistic use of the word ""coffee.""",1.0

the text appears to be a straightforward proposal or idea from howard, without any clear indicators of sarcasm. the language is direct and propositional, and there are no obvious rhetorical devices or emotional contrasts that would suggest sarcastic intent. while the idea might seem sudden or unusual, there's nothing in the text itself that implies howard isn't being sincere in his suggestion.",0.0

label: sarcastic

the statement by raj is clearly sarcastic. it's a mocking, teasing remark that uses exaggeration and irony to make fun of someone else's past experience. the phrase ""big talk"" contrasted with the absurd image of being ""treed by a chicken"" is a classic sarcastic structure, using verbal irony to belittle the other person's current stance or statement (which we don't see, but can infer from raj's response). the use of ""ooh"" at the beginning adds to the mocking tone, further emphasizing the sarcastic nature of the comment.",1.0

 LEONARD: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory"" is known for his intelligence and often condescending attitude. here, he's exaggerating the complexity of waitressing at the cheesecake factory by describing it as a ""complex socio-economic activity"" requiring ""a great deal of analysis and planning.""

the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the relatively straightforward job of waitressing and the overly intellectual and complex description sheldon provides. the use of words like ""complex,"" ""socio-economic,"" ""analysis,"" and ""planning"" in relation to a service industry job creates an absurd overstatement that signals sarcasm.

this type of exaggeration and mismatched level of complexity is a classic hallmark of sarcastic humor, especially coming from sheldon's character.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

this quote appears to be a humorous, absurdist statement combining elements from science fiction (battlestar galactica) with mundane objects (toast) in an unexpected way. the character sheldon is likely using sarcasm or deadpan humor to deliver this nonsensical line, which is characteristic of certain comedic styles in television shows. the incongruity between the serious tone and the absurd content strongly suggests sarcasm.",1.0

 LEONARD: Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way.
 SHELDON: How would you put it?
 LEONARD: Yeah, okay, like you said.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this statement is indeed sarcastic, though in a somewhat dry and understated way that's characteristic of sheldon's character. the sarcasm comes from:

1. the contrast between the casual, dismissive tone and the significance most people attribute to intercourse.

2. the implication that intercourse is not worth the effort, which goes against typical societal views and biological drives.

3. the clinical use of the term ""intercourse"" in this context, which adds to the detached and ironically analytical tone.

4. the character of sheldon is known for his lack of interest in physical intimacy and his tendency to analyze social and biological norms from an outsider's perspective.

so while it may not be overtly sarcastic in tone, the content and context make this a sarcastic statement, undermining the commonly held importance of sexual relationships.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by howard is clearly sarcastic, particularly in the last part where he suggests the person he's talking to would only get a new girlfriend by building one. this implies the person has difficulty finding romantic partners and exaggerates this by suggesting they'd need to artificially create a girlfriend. the contrast between how quickly the woman would find a new partner (""by tomorrow morning"") and the man's method (""when you figure out how to build one"") further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.",1.0

explanation:
the text contains sarcasm, specifically in the phrase ""no, i mean princess leia. of course i mean bernadette."" the speaker initially mentions princess leia, a fictional character from star wars, and then immediately corrects themselves with ""of course i mean bernadette,"" indicating that they were being sarcastic about princess leia. this abrupt shift and the use of ""of course"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the rest of the statement about bernadette being wonderful and liking the person being addressed appears to be sincere, but the initial sarcastic comment qualifies the entire input as sarcastic.",1.0

the response from sheldon is clearly sarcastic. he's using an exaggerated and absurd suggestion (an old-fashioned eating contest with hands behind backs) to mock or criticize whatever idea was proposed before. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the speaker says something they don't actually mean in order to convey criticism or ridicule.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the phrase ""i got a bone to pick with you"" is a common idiom used to directly express that someone has a complaint or issue to discuss. it's typically used in a straightforward, non-sarcastic manner.

2. the tone of the statement appears to be direct and confrontational, which aligns with the literal meaning of the idiom.

3. there are no contextual clues or linguistic markers that suggest irony or sarcasm. the speaker (howard) seems to be straightforwardly indicating his intention to discuss a grievance.

4. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""okay"" as an opener suggest a direct approach rather than a sarcastic one.

5. without any additional context that might contradict the literal interpretation, it's most reasonable to assume that howard is being sincere in his statement.

therefore, this statement is best classified as ""not sarcastic."" howard appears to be genuinely expressing his intention to discuss an issue with the person he's addressing.",0.0
"BERNADETTE: Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.","BERNADETTE: Should I give him another chance?

 BERNADETTE: Come here, tushy face.
 LEONARD: ""Tushy face. "" Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the provided cues and the input text. the statement uses a subtle form of sarcasm by juxtaposing the serious nature of operating heavy machinery with leonard's supposed emotional instability. the speaker is likely exaggerating or making light of leonard's emotional state by comparing it to a task that genuinely requires stability and focus. this contrast creates a humorous effect typical of sarcastic statements.",1.0

2. penny appears to be genuinely expressing that a topic has been sufficiently discussed, which is a common sentiment in everyday conversations.
3. there are no clear contrasting emotions or rhetorical devices that might suggest a sarcastic intent.
4. the language style is informal and conversational, which aligns with a sincere statement rather than a sarcastic one.
5. the phrase ""pretty well"" suggests a neutral to positive evaluation of leonard's previous explanation, which doesn't imply any hidden criticism or sarcasm.

therefore, the statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic comment about not needing to revisit a previously discussed topic.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

rationale:
1. the question posed by leonard appears to be a genuine inquiry, expressing concern or skepticism about someone's decision to move.
2. there's no clear contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which is typically present in sarcastic statements.
3. the language is straightforward and doesn't employ exaggeration or irony that often characterizes sarcasm.
4. the tone, while slightly skeptical, doesn't have the biting or mocking quality often associated with sarcasm.
5. the question seems to be part of a serious conversation about a significant life decision, which doesn't align with typical contexts for sarcasm.

therefore, this statement is best categorized as not sarcastic, but rather a genuine expression of leonard's opinion that moving to a new city might be an overreaction to whatever situation is being discussed.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. it makes a broad, exaggerated generalization about an entire ethnic group's food preferences.
2. the use of ""always"" is an extreme statement that's unlikely to be literally true, which is a common sarcastic device.
3. the informal tone and humorous approach to discussing cultural stereotypes suggest the speaker isn't being entirely serious.
4. the statement plays on well-known cultural stereotypes in a way that's meant to be humorous rather than factual.
5. the context of it being a quote from ""howard"" implies it might be a character speaking, possibly in a sitcom or comedy setting where sarcasm is common.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that this statement is meant to be taken as sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim about jewish dining preferences.",1.0

sarcastic

the response from penny is clearly sarcastic. she's jokingly suggesting that the person she's talking to is an alien spy studying humans. the use of phrases like ""alien overlords"" and the exaggerated scenario of studying weaknesses to report back are strong indicators of sarcasm. this kind of hyperbolic statement is a common form of sarcastic humor, especially in the context of a casual conversation or sitcom-like dialogue.",1.0

sarcastic

the dialogue from penny exhibits clear sarcastic undertones. the question ""there a new girlfriend in there?"" followed by ""'cause you might need one"" is a classic example of sarcasm. penny is not genuinely inquiring about a new girlfriend, but rather implying that the person she's addressing is likely single and in need of a relationship. the informal tone, use of implication, and the teasing nature of the comment all point towards a sarcastic intent, making this an unambiguous case of sarcastic dialogue.",1.0

reasoning:
while the tone of howard's question could be interpreted as slightly skeptical or questioning, there isn't enough context or clear indicators to confidently label this as sarcasm. the question appears to be a straightforward inquiry about someone's intended actions, albeit with a hint of confusion or surprise. without more context or clear markers of irony or exaggeration, it's safer to classify this as a non-sarcastic statement.",0.0

 SHELDON: Hello.
 PERSON: Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.
 SHELDON: Yes.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm, particularly through the incongruous combination of highly formal, technical scientific language and extremely casual modern slang. the quote begins with a precise scientific reference to einstein's 1917 paper, using the original german title, but then abruptly shifts to using the colloquial term ""bitchin'"" at the end. this jarring contrast creates a humorous effect typical of sarcasm.

the attribution of such casual language to einstein's ""fondest hope"" for his scientific work is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a comedic exaggeration. this kind of deliberate misattribution of modern, informal attitudes to historical figures is a common form of sarcastic humor.

therefore, based on the stylistic analysis and the content of the quote, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0

the input text is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. it matches all three keywords from the cues: ""sheldon,"" ""social awkwardness,"" and ""cornucopia.""

2. the use of ""cornucopia"" (which means an abundance) to describe ""social awkwardness"" is an exaggeration that's typical of sarcasm.

3. the phrase ""he does it all the time"" suggests a pattern of behavior, which is being commented on in a humorous way.

4. this statement is characteristic of the type of dialogue often associated with the character sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" who is known for his sarcastic and often socially inappropriate comments.

explanation:
the input sentence ""i just want to ask you a few questions about howard wolowitz"" is a straightforward, neutral statement expressing an intent to ask questions. there are no linguistic markers, emotional contrasts, or contextual clues that suggest sarcasm. the sentence is direct and lacks any ironic or mocking tone typically associated with sarcastic statements. therefore, it's appropriate to classify this statement as not sarcastic.",0.0

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit potentially awkward or humorous, sharing of personal medical information. the use of casual language and the idiom ""to make a long story short"" suggests sincerity rather than sarcasm. there are no clear indicators of irony or mocking tone that would typically be present in sarcastic statements. the content is factual and medical in nature, which further supports a non-sarcastic interpretation.",0.0

",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the response is sarcastic for several reasons:

1. amy's interpretation of a ""dirty story"" is literal and academic, rather than what bernadette likely intended (something more modern and sexually explicit).

2. the reference to ""the miller's tale"" by chaucer, while indeed considered risqué, is an extremely outdated and scholarly choice for a ""dirty story"" in a modern context.

3. the comment about sock drawers is anachronistic and absurd, highlighting the mismatch between 14th-century literature and modern expectations of ""dirty stories.""

4. the entire statement combines highbrow literary knowledge with a silly observation about socks, creating a humorous juxtaposition that is characteristic of sarcasm.

this response showcases amy's character traits (highly educated, socially awkward, literal-minded) while also poking fun at the concept of ""dirty stories"" and the anachronistic nature of considering medieval literature in modern contexts. the sarcasm lies in the deadpan delivery of this incongruous and exaggerated response to what was likely a simple dare.",1.0

this statement is likely sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the comparison between an accidental romantic kiss and kissing one's mother is humorously inappropriate and exaggerated.

2. the casual tone and personal anecdote about his mother create a comedic contrast with the presumably more serious romantic situation being discussed.

3. the phrase ""that happens with me and my mom all the time"" is an obvious exaggeration and unlikely to be true, indicating sarcastic humor.

4. the overall context suggests howard is making a joke rather than offering a sincere explanation or advice.

",BBT,1,"based on the input and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation: the statement ""sheldon: hey, you taught me something. who would have thought it?"" is clearly sarcastic. the phrase ""who would have thought it?"" is a common sarcastic expression implying surprise at something that the speaker actually considers unlikely or unexpected. in this context, sheldon is sarcastically expressing surprise at learning something from someone else, which suggests he typically sees himself as more knowledgeable than others. this aligns with the character of sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" who is known for his arrogance and belief in his own superior intelligence.",1.0

 LEONARD: She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the comment from sheldon is clearly sarcastic, using dismissive humor to belittle someone else's research. the comparison of discussing the research to a quick stop at a fast food drive-thru implies that the research is not substantial or worthy of a full dinner conversation, which aligns with the sarcastic and dismissive tone noted in the cues.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a straightforward, albeit grammatically incorrect, assertion by raj. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the context suggests a casual conversation about sleeping and sex, with raj claiming to have forbidden someone from having sex. while the language is informal and contains an error (""forboded"" instead of ""forbade""), these elements don't inherently indicate sarcasm. the direct and blunt communication style further supports a literal interpretation of the statement.",0.0

the statement, while crude and provocative, appears to be a direct and literal comment meant to antagonize or upset the person howard is speaking to. it doesn't contain the typical indicators of sarcasm such as irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. instead, it's a deliberately crass remark designed to elicit a negative reaction.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be genuinely positive and enthusiastic, with no apparent contrast or irony that would suggest sarcasm.
2. the language style is informal and colloquial, but not in a way that implies sarcasm.
3. the use of ""yeah"" and the rhetorical question ""isn't it?"" at the end are common in sincere, conversational speech.
4. there are no contextual clues or additional information that would indicate this statement is meant sarcastically.
5. the emotional tone extracted from the words ""great"" and ""alive"" supports a positive, non-sarcastic interpretation.

",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

the statement exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm:

1. it begins with a negative phrasing (""i'm not saying that you're not fun""), which often sets up a sarcastic statement.

2. this is immediately followed by an extreme positive assertion (""you're the most fun person i know""), creating a stark contrast.

3. the use of superlative ""most fun"" adds to the exaggerated nature of the statement, which is common in sarcasm.

4. the contrast between the initial negative implication and the subsequent overly positive affirmation is a typical sarcastic structure.

the cues provided also support this interpretation, particularly the note on the emotional contrast within the text. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcastic expression, where the literal meaning is at odds with the intended message. therefore, based on these elements, the statement is most likely sarcastic.",1.0

 PERSON2: Dibs.
",BBT,0,"not sarcastic

while the speaker expresses surprise or disbelief, there's no clear indication of sarcasm in this statement. the question seems to be a genuine expression of astonishment at an unexpected situation involving sheldon buying a loom and learning to weave. the use of ""i'm sorry"" here is likely meant to express confusion or to ask for clarification, rather than to convey sarcasm. the tone appears to be one of genuine surprise rather than mocking or ironic, which would be more characteristic of sarcasm.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of penny's statement, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. penny's statements are riddled with contradictions and exaggerations that are hallmarks of sarcasm. she claims not to be concerned, but her comments reveal the opposite. her criticism of leonard's girlfriend's makeup and the hyperbolic statement about renting out her womb to afford cute items further underscore the sarcastic tone of the entire passage.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
while the dialogue has a humorous element due to the anticlimax (ending with a request for a mint after serious medications), it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the character sheldon seems to be making a genuine, albeit unusual, request. the speech is direct and specific, using medical terminology, which is consistent with a non-sarcastic statement. the humor comes from the unexpected addition of the mint rather than from any ironic or sarcastic intent. this type of dialogue is characteristic of sitcom humor, where a character's quirky or overly precise manner of speaking is used for comedic effect without necessarily being sarcastic.",0.0

 BERNADETTE: I don't understand.
",BBT,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear hallmarks of sarcasm, including:

1. dramatic exaggeration: sheldon's reaction to someone drinking from leonard's glass is wildly disproportionate.
2. mock seriousness: treating a minor incident as if it were gravely important.
3. self-referential humor: sheldon speaking about himself in the third person.
4. hyperbole: suggesting this incident would be memorialized on his tombstone.

these elements combine to create a sarcastic statement that pokes fun at sheldon's own tendency to overreact and his obsession with perceived contamination or violation of his personal rules.",1.0

 HOWARD: Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" for the following reasons:

1. unexpected contrast: there's a humorous contrast between the act of gargling (typically associated with mouthwash or water) and using tequila, an alcoholic beverage.

2. understatement: the phrase ""may have swallowed a teeny bit"" is likely an understatement, which is a common feature of sarcasm. it downplays what is probably a more significant consumption of alcohol.

3. context and character: if this is from a tv show featuring a character named sheldon (likely from ""the big bang theory""), the character is known for his literal and socially awkward behavior. this statement coming from such a character adds to the sarcastic and humorous nature of the line.

4. tone: the casual, almost nonchalant way of describing accidentally drinking tequila suggests a sarcastic or ironic tone, especially if sheldon is typically a very careful or non-drinking character.

5. implied criticism: there's an implied self-criticism or acknowledgment of a mistake, presented in a humorous, sarcastic manner rather than a straightforward admission.

these elements combine to create a statement that is likely meant to be taken as sarcastic or ironic, rather than a literal, non-sarcastic description of events.",1.0

explanation:
the given text appears to be a straightforward definition or explanation, likely of a stroke or similar medical condition, comparing it to a heart attack. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this statement. the language is direct and informative, using a simile to explain a concept. the tone is neutral and educational, which is typical of sheldon's character (assuming this is from a script featuring the character sheldon from a show like ""the big bang theory""). without any contradictory context or ironic elements, this statement should be classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

",BBT,1,"based on the input and the context provided, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

the statement ""oh, yeah, that can only be good for you"" is clearly sarcastic. raj is implying the opposite of what he's saying - in reality, this situation is likely to be problematic or uncomfortable for the person he's talking to. the use of ""oh, yeah"" and the exaggerated certainty of ""can only be good"" are strong indicators of sarcasm in this context, especially given the potentially awkward or tense situation of a current girlfriend and an ex-girlfriend spending time together.",1.0

 SHELDON: Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
 AMY: Have you considered massage?
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the given cues, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the context: sheldon's character (from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his sarcastic remarks and discomfort with physical contact.

2. the explicit mention: sheldon states that he'd like to respond ""sarcastically,"" which is a clear indicator.

3. the content: the statement about relishing a stranger covering his body with oil is highly unlikely to be sincere, especially coming from sheldon's character.

4. the tone: the exaggerated enthusiasm in the statement contrasts with sheldon's typical aversion to such situations, further emphasizing the sarcastic intent.

5. punctuation: the use of a colon to introduce the sarcastic statement adds emphasis and sets up the sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement is clearly sarcastic.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and content, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

the statement ""which leonard was too cool to wear"" is a clear example of sarcasm. sheldon is implying that leonard thought he was too cool to wear the lapel pin, but he's saying it in a way that actually criticizes leonard's decision. this sarcastic remark, combined with the slightly condescending tone noted in the cues, strongly indicates that this dialogue is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the input and the current cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""oh, i could so see you being the face of hemorrhoids"" is clearly a sarcastic remark. it's not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous insult or joke at someone else's expense. the sarcasm lies in the absurdity of suggesting someone would be a good representative for such an uncomfortable and embarrassing medical condition. this kind of statement is a classic example of sarcastic humor.",1.0

sarcastic

the line ""when you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist"" has a sarcastic tone. amy is likely making a sardonic comment about someone's actions, implying they are inappropriately touching her while ostensibly doing something else (perhaps putting on a bracelet or watch). the phrasing is sharp and accusatory, using humor to point out and criticize the behavior, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0

 SHELDON: You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
 RAJ: I don't know if I want to play anymore.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear indicators of sarcasm, particularly in the exaggerated statement about the game being in ""serious trouble"" if not having a girlfriend becomes a reason not to play. this hyperbolic response, combined with the informal and conversational tone, strongly suggests a sarcastic intent. the character's dismissive attitude towards the idea that not having a girlfriend should affect playing dungeons & dragons further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1.0

 LEONARD: Yeah, every night for the last month.
 PENNY: Wow, can't believe he has a girlfriend.
 SHELDON: Me neither.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic."" 

this judgment is based on several key factors:

1. the use of irony: howard describes the news as ""fun,"" but the content (raj giving expensive gifts to emily) is likely not actually fun or positive from howard's perspective. this creates a contrast between the literal meaning of ""fun"" and the implied meaning, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. the context: given that this is part of a conversation about raj and emily's relationship, howard's tone suggests he might be critical or skeptical of raj's lavish gift-giving.

3. the informal, conversational tone: sarcasm is often employed in casual, informal speech.

4. the brevity and matter-of-fact delivery: sarcastic statements are often delivered in a straightforward manner, which contrasts with the actual sentiment behind them.

the combination of these elements, particularly the ironic use of ""fun news"" to describe potentially concerning behavior (excessive gift-giving), strongly indicates that howard's statement is sarcastic rather than sincere.",1.0

 SHELDON: Would you like to see the list?
 PENNY: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the threat of putting someone ""back on the list"" is likely not serious, but a humorous exaggeration.

2. the reference to a ""five and a quarter inch floppy"" disk is deliberately outdated and absurd in modern context, emphasizing the sarcastic tone.

3. sheldon's character (likely from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his dry humor and sarcastic remarks.

4. the juxtaposition of a seemingly serious threat with an outdated technology reference creates a humorous contrast typical of sarcasm.

therefore, based on these elements, the label ""sarcastic"" is most appropriate for this dialogue.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided context and the nature of the statement, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

this statement appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the context suggests this is part of a confrontational or argumentative situation.
2. the statement points out a hypocrisy or contradiction in someone's behavior, which is a common form of sarcasm.
3. the phrasing ""you see x in others, but not yourself"" is a classic structure used for sarcastic observations about human nature and self-awareness.
4. the emotional contrast between how betrayal is perceived in others versus oneself adds to the sarcastic tone, highlighting the irony of the situation.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle and context-dependent, in this case, the combination of the confrontational context and the pointed observation about hypocrisy strongly suggests that sheldon is being sarcastic in his statement.",1.0

2. the language is straightforward and lacks any ironic or contradictory elements typically associated with sarcasm.
3. the emotional tone (worry, uncertainty) is consistent throughout the statement, without any unexpected shifts that might indicate sarcasm.
4. the speaker's (bernadette's) words align with a sincere expression of distress over a potential breakup.
5. there are no exaggerated statements or humorous undertones that might suggest sarcastic intent.

this statement is clearly sarcastic. sheldon is making a mocking comment about his mother's religious group, implying that they have only just now accepted that the earth is not flat – a scientific fact that has been well-established for centuries. by sarcastically praising them for being ""advanced"" enough to sail without fear of falling off the edge of the earth, sheldon is actually highlighting how behind and resistant to scientific progress this group has been. the sarcasm is used to criticize the group's historical rejection of scientific knowledge in favor of outdated religious beliefs.",1.0

sarcastic

this statement by sheldon is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""allergic"" in this context is not literal but metaphorical, expressing strong disapproval. the phrase ""for no good reason"" further emphasizes his critical and dismissive attitude towards people winning nobel prizes, which he believes are undeserved. this combination of exaggeration (""allergic"") and dismissiveness is a hallmark of sarcastic speech, especially coming from a character like sheldon who is known for his sarcastic and often condescending remarks.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the exclamation ""oh, my god"" expresses genuine surprise or sudden realization.
2. the statement appears to be a sincere moment of recognition.
3. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrasting emotions that would suggest sarcasm.
4. the tone and language are consistent with a straightforward, honest reaction to remembering where the speaker knows someone from.

sarcastic

the line ""oh, how could i be so stu..."" (presumably meant to be ""stupid"") is a clear example of self-directed sarcasm. sheldon is expressing frustration at himself for falling for a trick or deception, and the use of this rhetorical question is a sarcastic way of emphasizing his perceived foolishness in the situation. the exaggerated self-criticism and the trailing off at the end further reinforce the sarcastic tone of the statement.",1.0
"BERNADETTE: Well, if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.","PENNY: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?

sarcastic

the statement by bernadette is clearly sarcastic. she uses the phrase ""if you don't mind"" followed by a negative comparison (""looking like an orange traffic cone"") and then concludes with ""great"" in a way that's obviously not meant to be taken at face value. this combination of seemingly positive words (""don't mind"" and ""great"") with a critical comparison creates a classic sarcastic structure. the cues provided also support this interpretation, noting the sarcastic use of ""great"" and the overall critical tone of the statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is clearly being used sarcastically in contrast with the description of people saying ""horrible things about each other in public."" this juxtaposition of negative behavior with a positive description is a classic indicator of sarcasm. leonard is using irony to emphasize how unpleasant the night actually was, rather than genuinely describing it as magical.",1.0

",BBT,1,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i believe this statement is not sarcastic. here's why:

1. tone and context: the text appears to be a straightforward statement from sheldon, who is genuinely expressing interest in the woman he's talking about. there's no apparent irony or contradiction in his words.

2. language style: the informal, conversational tone and the use of an anecdote suggest sheldon is sincerely sharing information he finds fascinating.

3. emotional content: sheldon describes the woman as ""very interesting,"" which aligns with the unusual fact he presents about her. this consistency suggests he's being genuine rather than sarcastic.

4. lack of contrasting elements: there's no clear juxtaposition or unexpected twist that would typically signal sarcasm.

5. character context: if this is the sheldon from ""the big bang theory"" (which seems likely given the name and style of speech), he's known for being direct and often fascinated by unusual scientific or medical facts. this statement aligns with that character trait.

while the information shared is unusual and somewhat gruesome, it appears to be presented as a genuinely interesting fact rather than a sarcastic comment. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" seems most appropriate for this text.",0.0
"SHELDON: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.","LEONARD: No, that was a different, different guy.

 SHELDON: Oh, oh, oh.
 SHELDON: Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?
 LEONARD: No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister.
 PENNY: All right, well, what do you think he wants?
 LEONARD: I don't know.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

the input text is clearly sarcastic. several factors contribute to this assessment:

1. incongruity: the statement begins with a seemingly innocent observation about the holidays, but then takes an unexpected and crude turn.

2. dark humor: the joke about lodging a testicle is deliberately shocking and inappropriate, especially when juxtaposed with the mention of holidays.

3. tone: the casual way in which sheldon delivers this crude anatomical joke suggests a sarcastic or mocking attitude.

4. context: while we don't have the full context, this type of comment is characteristic of the character sheldon from ""the big bang theory,"" who often makes socially inappropriate or sarcastic remarks.

5. implied criticism: the sarcasm seems to be directed at someone's behavior or situation, implying criticism or mockery.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the statement is meant to be sarcastic rather than sincere or literal.",1.0

 SHELDON: Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.
 LEONARD: I told you. That was a different guy.
",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious irony or exaggeration typically associated with sarcasm.
2. the tone, while slightly disappointed, is sincere and matches the content of the message.
3. the reference to ""waiting for the ball to drop"" is a common new year's eve activity and is mentioned in a matter-of-fact way.
4. the language style is informal and conversational, but not notably sarcastic.
5. the mild disappointment expressed (""that's too bad"") is consistent with the overall message and doesn't indicate sarcasm.

therefore, this statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic comment about a missed opportunity to spend new year's eve in a particular way.",0.0

 PENNY: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
",BBT,1,"based on the context provided and the content of sheldon's statement, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

sheldon's response is clearly sarcastic. he's dismissing the importance of a biological achievement by using an exaggerated and childish description (""yucky, squishy things"") to describe the entire field of biology. this is typical of sheldon's character, who often uses sarcasm to belittle fields of study he considers inferior to his own. the contrast between acknowledging that the news ""sounded important"" and then immediately trivializing it underscores the sarcastic tone of his statement.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the nature of the input text, i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

the context and style of the statement suggest that this is likely a sarcastic remark. the character sheldon is suggesting that a woman might want ""a man with a pocket watch,"" which is an outdated and unusual trait to desire in a partner. this comment appears to be intentionally absurd or exaggerated, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the humor implied in the statement and the quirky perspective it represents further support the sarcastic interpretation of this line.",1.0

sarcastic

the response from leonard is clearly sarcastic. he uses an exaggerated and humorous simile comparing the neck massage to an eagle's grip, implying that the massage is overly aggressive and uncomfortable rather than relaxing. this hyperbolic comparison is a classic hallmark of sarcasm, used to criticize or mock the quality of the massage in a witty, indirect manner.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

 AMY: Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

this statement is sarcastic for several reasons:

1. context: sheldon is a character known for his intelligence and arrogance, often comparing himself to great minds.

2. false equivalence: he's drawing a parallel between his situation and einstein's, implying he's on the same intellectual level.

3. factual inaccuracy: as the cues point out, einstein didn't actually fail math. this is a common myth.

4. self-aggrandizement: sheldon is using this false information to elevate his own status, suggesting he's unchallenged like einstein supposedly was.

5. tone: the statement has an air of superiority and dismissiveness typical of sarcasm.

sheldon is using sarcasm to deflect from his own shortcomings by comparing himself to einstein and repeating a well-known (but false) anecdote. the sarcasm lies in the irony of using incorrect information to support his claim of superior intelligence.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the context of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text exhibits clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the contrasting emotions of encouragement and pressure.
2. the juxtaposition of expressing confidence while implying doubt.
3. the minimization of a complex task (""just biology"") immediately after emphasizing its difficulty.
4. the exaggerated praise (""genius like you"") in the context of a challenging task.

these elements combine to create a tone that is not genuinely supportive, but rather ironically highlighting the difficulty of the task and possibly the other person's perceived limitations. the sarcasm is subtle but evident in the overall structure and word choice of the statement.",1.0

sarcastic

the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the contrast between the dismissive ""screw her"" and the seemingly generous act of ""letting her hang out with us"" creates irony.

2. the use of ""just lucky"" is likely not meant literally, but rather to emphasize the speaker's perceived superiority.

3. the overall tone is condescending and dismissive, which often accompanies sarcastic statements.

4. the informal language and short, emphatic sentences are common in sarcastic speech.

5. the exclusivity implied in the statement suggests a mocking attitude towards the person being discussed.

these elements combine to create a statement that is not meant to be taken at face value, but rather to convey contempt or mockery through irony, which is a key characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0

sarcastic

the statement by leonard is clearly a sarcastic joke. he's exaggerating the concept of living with one's mother by suggesting living inside her body, which is absurd and impossible. this kind of hyperbole and absurdist humor is a common form of sarcasm. the context cues also support this interpretation, noting that it appears to be a ""sarcastic or absurdist joke."" the unusual nature of the suggestion and the comparison between living in someone's house and living in their body further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0

 PERSON: Yeah, nice speech, Francine.
 RAJ: I'm not done, but thank you.
 RAJ: I think back....
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" based on the following reasoning:

1. unexpected contrast: the text starts with a seemingly nostalgic recollection of good times and friendship, but then takes a sharp turn with the revelation of an extremely personal and taboo secret.

2. incongruity: the juxtaposition of a relatively mild secret (addiction to pedicures) with a shocking and potentially disturbing one (losing virginity to a cousin) creates a stark contrast that is often used in sarcastic humor.

3. tone shift: the casual way in which raj delivers this information (""uh, when we went camping..."") doesn't match the gravity of the secret revealed, suggesting a sarcastic or ironic tone.

4. social commentary: the sarcasm here might be commenting on the nature of oversharing or the unexpected consequences of ""telling each other all our secrets.""

5. comedic effect: the structure of the revelation, building from a mundane secret to a shocking one, is a common technique in comedy and often used in sarcastic statements for dramatic effect.

this combination of elements strongly suggests that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically rather than at face value, despite being presented as a straightforward recollection of events.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone of the conversation is casual and friendly, without any indicators of irony or sarcasm.
2. howard is genuinely inquiring about someone else's night and then describing his own activities in a straightforward manner.
3. the activities mentioned (making gift bags, drinking wine, browsing online) are typical social activities that don't suggest any hidden meaning or sarcastic intent.
4. the language style is informal and conversational, which aligns with sincere communication rather than sarcasm.
5. there's no emotional contrast or unexpected juxtaposition that might indicate sarcasm.

sarcastic

the statement ""well, if that's all it takes, it's a good thing you don't have a dog"" exhibits several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""well"" at the beginning suggests a mildly exasperated or ironic tone.
2. the phrase ""if that's all it takes"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is actually more complex or difficult than suggested.
3. the conclusion ""it's a good thing you don't have a dog"" is likely a dry, humorous comment implying that the person being addressed would struggle with the responsibilities of dog ownership.

the cues also mention that the text appears to contain sarcasm or dry humor, which supports this interpretation. the informal, conversational tone and the use of a conditional statement followed by a seemingly contradictory conclusion are typical of sarcastic remarks in everyday speech.",1.0

 SHELDON: Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the label for this input is ""sarcastic"" based on the following reasoning:

1. understatement: as noted in the cues, penny's description of the higgs boson as ""a very famous boson"" is an understatement. this understated description of a highly significant scientific discovery creates a humorous effect, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

2. context implication: the phrase ""of course, it is..."" suggests that penny is responding to someone who might not know about the higgs boson. her tone implies that this information should be obvious, which can be interpreted as mildly sarcastic.

3. juxtaposition: there's a subtle contrast between the scientific importance of the higgs boson and penny's casual way of describing it. this juxtaposition of tone and subject matter is often used in sarcastic comments.

4. pop culture reference: while not explicitly stated in the cues, this dialogue is likely from the tv show ""the big bang theory,"" where penny often uses sarcasm when discussing scientific topics with her more academically inclined friends.

given these factors, especially the use of understatement and the implied tone, the statement can be classified as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

the line is clearly meant to be sarcastic, using childish language about a basic bodily function in contrast with the prestige of a nobel prize. leonard is expressing mockery or disbelief, likely about someone receiving undeserved recognition for a minor achievement. this juxtaposition of the highly esteemed nobel prize with infantile toilet humor is a classic example of sarcasm.",1.0

",BBT,0,"given the context and the cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the phrase ""i dumbed it down"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something was simplified for others who might not understand, which fits with sheldon's character and his tendency to view himself as intellectually superior.

2. the juxtaposition of a highly technical scientific title with the accusation of being a ""witch"" creates a humorous contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm.

3. the implication that religious people would consider advanced physics as witchcraft is an exaggeration used for comedic effect, which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. this statement is consistent with sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" who often makes sarcastic comments about having to simplify his work for others.

while this statement is humorous and uses scientific terminology in an unexpected way, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. penny is being direct and flirtatious, using a clever turn of phrase to express sexual attraction. the use of ""limbic system"" adds a quirky, pseudo-intellectual flavor to the come-on, but it's not meant to convey the opposite of what she's saying. rather, it's a playful and direct way of expressing desire. the statement is meant to be taken at face value as a flirtatious comment, albeit an unusually worded one.",0.0

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the nature of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reason for this label is:

1. the text uses wordplay with ""under"" in two different contexts, which is a common sarcastic technique.
2. the second part of howard's statement (""my mom's kind of under my dentist"") is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but is a humorous and likely exaggerated way of describing an awkward or embarrassing situation.
3. the contrast between bernadette's innocent illness and the implied sexual relationship of howard's mother with his dentist creates an unexpected and humorous juxtaposition, which is characteristic of sarcasm.
4. the casual way howard delivers this potentially shocking information about his mother suggests he's using sarcasm to cope with or downplay an uncomfortable situation.

this combination of wordplay, unexpected contrast, and casual delivery of potentially shocking information strongly indicates that the statement is sarcastic in nature.",1.0

the text displays clear signs of sarcasm, particularly through the use of irony and humorous juxtaposition. howard's statement that they ""don't do what we do for glory and fame"" is contradicted by the attention-seeking nature of his comment. the inclusion of ""howie mandels"" alongside more typically famous professions adds a comedic and self-deprecating element that further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the analysis provided in the current cues and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

 BERNADETTE: That's a lot for a kid to deal with.
",BBT,0,"based on the provided cues and context, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this input text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text uses humor through the unexpected mention of ""ben and jerry"" (ice cream) as a mood lifter alongside howard himself.
2. there's an element of self-deprecating humor in equating his ability to cheer someone up with ice cream.
3. the casual, conversational tone and the use of allusion (ben & jerry's ice cream) are often indicators of sarcasm in everyday speech.
4. the juxtaposition of howard claiming to be ""the only person who could cheer her up"" and then immediately mentioning ice cream creates a humorous contradiction that is characteristic of sarcasm.

while the text doesn't use overtly sarcastic language, the subtle humor and self-deprecation suggest that howard is not being entirely serious about his unique ability to cheer up the person in question, making this statement sarcastic in nature.",1.0

 LEONARD: Well, he's not wrong.
Howard did go to the International Space Station.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the input text demonstrates clear sarcastic undertones. the use of the idiom ""milk that cow"" in this context is a sarcastic way of expressing frustration with someone who is continuing to dwell on or exploit a past event. sheldon's rhetorical question ""how much longer is he gonna milk that cow?"" is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to convey exasperation and criticism of the person's behavior. the sarcasm is further emphasized by the contrast between the five-week timeframe and the implication that the person is still bringing up the event, which sheldon clearly feels is excessive. this combination of a figurative expression, rhetorical question, and implied criticism all point to a sarcastic tone in the statement.",1.0
"PENNY: Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.","PENNY: Damn.
 AMY: Well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother.
 AMY: And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

the statement by penny is likely intended to be sarcastic or humorous. here's why:

1. the use of exaggeration: penny claims she ""still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs,"" which is an extreme reaction to something as innocuous as crayons.

2. implication of an embarrassing incident: the statement implies a past event involving crayons that was so impactful it still affects her physically, which is likely an overstatement for comedic effect.

3. unexpected connection: linking crayons (typically associated with childhood innocence) to a physical reaction of discomfort creates a surprising and humorous contrast.

4. tone and delivery: the casual ""anyway"" at the beginning and the overall structure of the sentence suggest a deadpan or dry humor delivery, common in sarcastic remarks.

5. absurdity: the idea of having such a strong, ongoing reaction to crayons is inherently absurd, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic or ironic humor.

given these factors, the statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic, using humor to possibly deflect from or make light of a past embarrassing situation.",1.0

label: sarcastic

sheldon's response exhibits clear sarcastic undertones. the phrase ""it's like you're not even trying to get better"" is a sarcastic remark implying frustration with someone's lack of progress or understanding. the exaggerated comparison to the situation ""half an hour ago"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, suggesting that the person should have made noticeable improvement in that time frame, which sheldon clearly finds unreasonable or disappointing.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the input text and the provided cues, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the phrase ""beam you up"" is a reference to the science fiction series star trek, where it's used for teleportation.
2. this phrase is often used sarcastically in everyday conversation to suggest that someone is out of touch with reality or should remove themselves from a situation.
3. the question mark at the end, as noted in the cues, can indicate a rhetorical question, which is often used in sarcastic statements.
4. the overall tone of the question seems to be mocking or dismissive, suggesting it's not meant to be taken literally.

these factors combined strongly indicate that the statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine suggestion.",1.0

the statement from penny appears to be a genuine comparison and compliment. she's likening two people to bert and ernie from sesame street, known for their educational role. penny is expressing appreciation for how these individuals teach her about words and numbers, similar to how bert and ernie educate children on the show. the tone is straightforward and appreciative, without any indicators of irony or sarcasm. the informal, conversational style and the use of a pop culture reference further support that this is a sincere statement rather than a sarcastic one.",0.0

label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using understatement and self-deprecating humor to acknowledge that his actions (setting up a camera) have gone well beyond what would be considered merely ""creepy."" the phrase ""looking at creepy in the rearview mirror"" is a figurative way of saying they've left ""creepy"" far behind, implying his actions are much worse. this kind of self-aware exaggeration is a classic form of sarcasm, where the speaker acknowledges their wrongdoing in a humorous, understated way.",1.0

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of exaggerated language: ""a lane frequented by liars"" is an over-the-top statement that suggests sarcasm.

2. the repetition and intensification of ""liar"": using ""liar"" twice and adding ""big"" as an intensifier points to sarcastic emphasis.

3. the accusatory and confrontational tone: this is typical of sarcastic remarks aimed at mocking or criticizing someone.

4. the exclamation mark at the end adds to the dramatic, exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that the speaker is not being literal, but rather using sarcasm to make a point or express frustration.",1.0

label: sarcastic

explanation:
while the statement itself doesn't contain overt sarcasm, the context and character information strongly suggest this is a sarcastic or humorous moment. sheldon's abrupt change of subject to an unexpected and irrelevant topic (yodeling) is likely meant to be comically awkward or deliberately absurd. this kind of non-sequitur is often used in sitcoms for comedic effect, especially when associated with a character known for social awkwardness or unusual behavior. the juxtaposition of wanting to change the subject and then immediately mentioning something as random as yodeling creates a humorous effect that can be interpreted as a form of situational sarcasm or irony.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the use of the word ""wasted"" in this context suggests frustration and disappointment, which are often emotions associated with sarcasm.

3. the character sheldon, particularly from ""the big bang theory"" if this is the context, is known for his dry and often sarcastic remarks.
4. the exaggeration in ""all that time"" further emphasizes the perceived waste, which is a typical sarcastic technique to highlight absurdity or disappointment.

while the statement could be interpreted literally, the combination of the emotional cue ""wasted"" and the context strongly suggests that this is a sarcastic remark expressing frustration over a seemingly pointless effort.",1.0

1. the question ""what do you think i was gonna do at home?"" is a straightforward query without any clear indicators of sarcasm.
2. the language style is informal and colloquial, which is common in everyday speech and doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm.
3. there are no obvious emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices that might suggest sarcasm.
4. the context is limited, making it difficult to infer any sarcastic intent.
5. while the question could potentially be used sarcastically in a specific context, there's not enough information provided to assume sarcasm is present.

without additional context or tone indicators, it's more likely that this is a genuine question asked in a casual manner, rather than a sarcastic statement.",0.0

howard's statement is clearly sarcastic. he's not genuinely suggesting a career in home care for the old and fat. instead, he's using a mocking tone to make a point, likely in response to someone's complaint or statement. the sarcasm is evident in the exaggerated and somewhat insulting nature of the suggestion, which is not meant to be taken literally but rather to emphasize his point or critique in a biting, humorous way.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment. the label for this text is:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of aposiopesis (trailing off sentences) suggests hesitation and uncertainty, which can be a set-up for sarcasm.

2. the contrast between the hopeful suggestion of living together and the abrupt, resigned ""oh, sure"" at the end implies a shift in tone that's characteristic of sarcasm.

3. the phrase ""oh, sure"" is often used sarcastically, especially when it follows a pause or hesitation.

4. the overall structure of the dialogue, with its fragmented sentences and self-corrections, builds tension that culminates in the sarcastic ""oh, sure.""

5. the emotional contrast noted in the cues, moving from optimism to disappointment or resignation, is a common pattern in sarcastic statements.

the sarcasm here seems to be self-directed, with amy initially proposing the idea of living together, then immediately undercutting her own suggestion with a sarcastic ""oh, sure,"" implying that she realizes it's not actually a good or realistic idea.",1.0

the statement by amy clearly exhibits sarcasm. she's using exaggeration and contrast to express her frustration and jealousy over a romantic situation. the hyperbole of ""two minutes"" versus ""three years"" and the stark difference in outcomes (nothing vs. taking pants off) are classic hallmarks of sarcastic expression. amy is not literally describing events, but rather using biting humor to convey her feelings of hurt and betrayal in this situation.",1.0

label: sarcastic

explanation: 
the statement by penny exhibits classic characteristics of sarcasm. she's taking a negative situation (presumably visiting a place or seeing something undesirable) and framing it as a positive learning experience in an ironic way. the phrase ""it's like a lesson in what not to do"" is particularly indicative of sarcasm, as it's using the concept of a ""lesson"" to highlight the negative aspects of whatever they're experiencing. the keywords ""lesson"" and ""what not to do"" further support this interpretation, as they're often used in sarcastic contexts to point out flaws or mistakes.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the input and the provided cues, i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic for the following reasons:

1. the use of ""wow"" at the beginning suggests an exaggerated or insincere reaction.

2. the phrase ""where no man has gone before"" is indeed a reference to the star trek catchphrase, as noted in the cues.

3. in this context, howard is probably using this well-known phrase ironically to comment on someone's actions or behavior, implying they've done something either extremely foolish, inappropriate, or unprecedented in a negative way.

4. the combination of the exclamation ""wow"" with the star trek reference creates a mismatch between the tone and the content, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

therefore, the statement is most likely meant to be understood as sarcastic rather than a genuine compliment or statement of awe.",1.0

this statement does not appear to be sarcastic. the speaker is genuinely expressing uncertainty about whether the object is a tribble or a toupee, and they sincerely find it ""pretty cool"" regardless of what it actually is. the tone is light-hearted and curious, but not sarcastic. the use of informal language and the humorous comparison between a tribble and a toupee suggest a casual, honest observation rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

label: sarcastic

the text demonstrates clear sarcastic undertones in leonard's response. he's using indirect language and a mocking tone to describe a situation where someone (likely penny) was flirting without wearing their engagement ring, leading to a misunderstanding. the use of ""ah, that's a good question"" and the repetitive ""someone"" phrasing adds to the sarcastic delivery, implying disapproval or frustration with the situation in a passive-aggressive manner.",1.0

 PENNY: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

### label: sarcastic

the reasons for this classification include:

1. the use of hyperbole: ""balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere"" is an exaggerated statement, which is a common element in sarcastic speech.

2. the contrast between expectation and reality: bernadette expresses surprise that the item is still in possession, which contrasts with her assumption that it was discarded or neglected.

3. the informal and colloquial language: the use of ""wow"" and the phrase ""balled up"" suggests a casual, potentially sarcastic tone.

4. the implied criticism: there's a subtle implication that bernadette thought the item wasn't well cared for, which could be interpreted as a sarcastic jab.

while the sarcasm is relatively mild, these elements together suggest that bernadette's statement is more likely to be sarcastic than not.",1.0

SHELDON: I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.,"LEONARD: Okay, why?
",BBT,1,"given the context and the cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this statement is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the character sheldon (presumably from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his sarcastic and often blunt comments.

2. snoring is generally considered an annoying sound that disrupts sleep, not something one would typically miss or find comforting.

3. the juxtaposition of ""listening to you snore"" and ""wondering how i'll ever sleep without it"" creates an ironic contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm.

4. the cues mention ""attachment"" and ""fondness,"" but in this context, they're likely being used ironically to emphasize the opposite sentiment.

the statement appears to be a sarcastic way of pointing out how disruptive and annoying the snoring is, rather than a genuine expression of attachment or fondness.",1.0
"AMY: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it.","AMY: It's nice they're getting exercise.

 SHELDON: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.
 AMY: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast.
",BBT,0,"sarcastic

i believe this label is correct based on the following reasoning:

1. the last sentence, ""look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it,"" appears to be a sarcastic comment.

2. this statement is likely an exaggeration used to humorously point out that the dashboard is very messy with syrup.

3. the contrast between the mundane topic (breakfast and a messy dashboard) and the exaggerated observation creates a subtle irony typical of sarcasm.

4. the casual, conversational tone and the abrupt shift to this observation about the dashboard support the sarcastic interpretation.

5. while there are no explicit emotional words, the implied frustration or resignation about the messy situation is conveyed through sarcasm.

the sarcasm is subtle and delivered in a deadpan manner, which is often characteristic of dry humor or mild sarcasm in everyday conversations.",1.0

 BERNADETTE: So there<i> are</i> things you don't like.
",BBT,1,"based on the provided context and cues, i would label this text as:

the line ""i'm gonna chew my leg off"" is an exaggerated, sarcastic expression indicating howard's strong desire to escape an unpleasant conversation. this hyperbolic statement, combined with the frustration evident in his words, points to a sarcastic tone rather than a literal intention.",1.0

you're okay with that.
 BERNADETTE: Uh-huh.
",BBT,1,"based on the given input and the extracted keywords, i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

label: sarcastic

explanation: the statement by bernadette is clearly sarcastic. she's using irony to express her dissatisfaction with the unfair distribution of responsibilities in her relationship. the phrase ""and i love that..."" followed by a description of an unequal situation (her doing both work and all the cleaning) is a classic sarcastic structure. the final part, ""and you're okay with that,"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, implying that her partner's acceptance of this imbalance is not actually appreciated. the keywords ""work"" and ""cleaning"" highlight the main elements of her complaint, supporting the sarcastic interpretation.",1.0
"SHELDON: Oh, you're hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose.","SHELDON: Wow. I don't know which hurts worse-- my nose or my heart.

 LEONARD: Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.
",BBT,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear characteristics of sarcasm, particularly through its use of exaggeration and absurd scenarios. the mixture of plausible medical risks (infection, blood clot) with an outlandish scenario (barn spider laying eggs in the nose) is a classic sarcastic technique. the tone is deliberately alarmist and the hyperbole is evident, especially in the spider eggs example. this combination of factual and far-fetched elements, delivered in a seemingly serious manner, is a hallmark of sarcastic speech, especially when used to exaggerate fears or risks.",1.0
"BERNADETTE: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you're in there spending an hour on your hair.","SHELDON: I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.

 SHELDON: Amy, you're a neuroscientist.
Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.
",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the following analysis:

1. contextual contrast: bernadette expresses love for her partner's pride in appearance, but immediately follows it with a complaint about not being able to use the bathroom. this juxtaposition of positive and negative sentiments is a common indicator of sarcasm.

2. exaggeration: the phrase ""spending an hour on your hair"" is likely an exaggeration to emphasize the excessive time spent grooming, which is another hallmark of sarcastic expression.

3. implied frustration: while bernadette starts with ""i love,"" the overall message conveys frustration about the inconvenience caused by her partner's grooming habits. this mismatch between the stated emotion and the underlying sentiment is characteristic of sarcasm.

4. tone: the structure of the sentence, particularly the use of ""even when,"" suggests a tone of mock approval or feigned enthusiasm, which is often used in sarcastic statements.

5. social context: this type of comment is commonly used in relationships to express mild annoyance or criticism in a lighthearted, indirect manner, which often takes the form of sarcasm.

given these factors, the statement is most likely intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine expression of love for the partner's grooming habits.",1.0

",BBT,1,"given the context and tone of the statement, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

the statement ""i love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink"" is clearly sarcastic. howard is not genuinely praising someone for not urinating in the kitchen sink, as that would be an extremely low bar for good behavior. instead, he's using irony to criticize or mock someone, likely for being overly proper or pretentious. the sarcasm lies in treating a basic expectation of hygiene and decency as if it were an impressive achievement.",1.0

",BBT,0,"based on the information provided and my analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward question from howard about professor abbott's belongings.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.

the statement from howard appears to be a genuine, thoughtful reflection on finding meaning in life. it doesn't contain any obvious markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. instead, it presents a sincere, albeit somewhat melancholy, perspective on how people might find fulfillment in their lives even if they don't achieve traditionally ""great"" things. the contrasts noted in the context information support this interpretation, highlighting the philosophical nature of the statement rather than any sarcastic intent.",0.0

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the context appears to be from a sitcom (likely ""the big bang theory"" given the character names), where sarcasm is common.

2. penny's response has a mildly condescending tone, implying that sheldon staying on topic is unusual and worthy of exaggerated praise.

3. the phrase ""that was almost on topic"" suggests that sheldon's previous statement wasn't entirely relevant, but penny is choosing to praise him anyway.

4. the use of ""i'm gonna say, 'good job, sheldon'"" instead of directly saying ""good job, sheldon"" adds a layer of distance and insincerity to the praise.

5. the overall tone and context suggest that penny is not genuinely impressed, but rather sarcastically praising sheldon for barely meeting a low bar of conversation expectations.",1.0

",BBT,1,"based on the provided cues and input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the statement is clearly sarcastic. penny is not genuinely suggesting that they should have their mom send pants from a walmart in houston. instead, she's using this exaggerated and impractical scenario to mock or criticize the other person's suggestion or behavior. the sarcasm is evident in the absurdity of having a parent mail clothing from a specific walmart location in another city, which is an inefficient and unusual way to obtain clothing. this kind of exaggerated, mocking statement is a hallmark of sarcastic speech.",1.0

3. the language style is described as informal and conversational, which is consistent with a straightforward inquiry.
4. there are no emotional contrasts or strong sentiment noted that might suggest sarcasm.

",BBT,0,"based on the cues provided and the nature of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this judgment is based on several factors:

1. the contrast between the serious physical symptoms and the seemingly casual way sheldon is discussing them suggests a sarcastic tone.

2. the use of alliteration (""cranky and crampy"") adds a humorous element that's often associated with sarcasm.

3. the question format, ending with a question mark, can be interpreted as a rhetorical question, which is a common sarcastic device.

4. the character sheldon (likely referring to sheldon cooper from ""the big bang theory"") is known for his socially inappropriate and often sarcastic comments, especially when discussing topics he's uncomfortable with.

5. the blunt and potentially insensitive way of referring to someone's physical discomfort is more likely to be intended as sarcasm rather than a genuine inquiry.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that this statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically, likely as a commentary on the difficulty of interacting with someone experiencing these symptoms, rather than a sincere question about the logistics of a task.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward, factual response to an unheard question or comment about throw pillows.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory emotional tones.
3. the language used is casual and direct, which is consistent with normal conversational speech rather than sarcastic delivery.
4. the content of the statement (stuart independently choosing throw pillows) doesn't seem to be inherently humorous or absurd in a way that would typically prompt sarcasm.
5. there's no contextual information suggesting that raj's relationship with stuart or the situation around choosing throw pillows would make this statement likely to be sarcastic.

2. the language used is casual and sincere, typical of a genuine response in a conversation.
3. there's no detected irony or unexpected contrast between the words and their intended meaning.

",BBT,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the text is clearly a sarcastic comment from sheldon to leonard. here's why:

1. the tone is mocking and condescending, starting with ""yeah, good for you, leonard"" in a way that's not genuinely supportive.

2. sheldon uses an exaggerated comparison to belittle leonard's idea, likening it to wishing for a telephone before it was invented.

3. the phrase ""stand back while i invent the telephone"" is hyperbolic and meant to ridicule leonard's suggestion as obvious or simplistic.

4. the imaginary phone call to leonard's uncle is a classic sarcastic device, pretending to receive a call that doesn't exist to deliver an insult.

5. the use of ""you just got burned"" is a clear indicator of mockery and sarcasm.

the combination of these elements, along with the context provided by the extracted keywords, strongly supports the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1.0

2. there's no obvious contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
3. the tone seems matter-of-fact and doesn't contain any clear indicators of irony or sarcasm.

explanation:
while the statement has a hypothetical tone that could potentially be interpreted as sarcastic in certain contexts, there's not enough evidence in this single line or the provided cues to confidently label it as sarcastic. the sentence appears to be a straightforward, albeit somewhat sad, expression of amy's lack of close friendships. 

the language style is informal and personal, using a conditional statement to express a hypothetical scenario. there's no clear contrast or exaggeration that typically characterizes sarcasm. the emotional undertone seems to be one of loneliness or regret, rather than the biting or mocking tone often associated with sarcasm.

without more context about amy's personality, the conversation's broader context, or her tone of voice, it's safer to interpret this statement as a sincere, albeit somewhat melancholy, reflection on her social situation. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is the most appropriate based on the available information.",0.0

sarcastic

the reason for this judgment is:

1. the phrase ""buckle up"" is typically associated with excitement or preparing for an intense experience, which contrasts sharply with the ""cranky night"" that follows.

2. this contrast between the energetic ""buckle up"" and the negative ""cranky night"" creates a sarcastic tone.

3. sheldon's statement appears to be using mock enthusiasm to highlight the unpleasant experience ahead, which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. the cues mention an emotional contrast, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic statements.

the statement by leonard is clearly a humorous and sarcastic comment. he's making a joke by referencing ""the force"" from star wars to exaggerate his ability to sense someone's arrival. this type of hyperbolic statement using pop culture references is a common form of sarcasm, especially in sitcom-style dialogue. the absurdity of claiming to sense someone entering california airspace through a fictional mystical power is a clear indicator of sarcastic intent.",1.0

2. the rest of the statement appears to be a straightforward observation about surroundings (moon and trees) followed by a factual comment about elizabeth mcnulty's death.
3. while mentioning someone's death could potentially be used sarcastically in some contexts, there's no clear indication of sarcastic intent here. the statement seems more contemplative than sarcastic.

4. the informal, conversational style suggests a straightforward expression of amazement at an unusual fact.
5. while the concept of getting married in a denny's might seem unusual, las vegas is known for unique wedding venues, so this information is likely being presented as a genuinely interesting discovery rather than a sarcastic comment.

the input text demonstrates clear signs of sarcasm through chandler's use of allusion and humor. he's referencing lyrics from the song ""get down tonight"" by kc and the sunshine band, but applying them in a context that's likely different from and incongruous with the original situation being discussed. this mismatch between the upbeat, party-oriented lyrics and whatever situation chandler is actually describing creates a sarcastic tone.

chandler's character in the tv show ""friends"" is also known for his frequent use of sarcasm and witty remarks, which further supports this interpretation. the phrase ""well pretty much get down to that"" at the end adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's a casual way of summing up the referenced lyrics in a way that suggests chandler isn't being entirely serious about the situation.

given these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this input.",1.0

this quote from chandler in ""friends"" is a classic example of his dry, sarcastic humor. while the advice itself is factually correct and commonly given, the way chandler delivers it in the context of the show is likely meant to be humorous and sarcastic. 

chandler's character is known for his witty, often sarcastic remarks, and this line is delivered in a way that turns a mundane piece of health advice into a funny moment. the sarcasm comes from stating something so obvious in such a deadpan, matter-of-fact manner, as if it's profound wisdom rather than common sense.

so while the content of the advice is sincere, the delivery and context make it sarcastic, fitting chandler's typical comedic style in the show.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

this line from chandler is indeed sarcastic. the context and chandler's character from ""friends"" are key here. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor and awkward attempts at emotional support. 

the statement ""i'd miss you if i broke up with you"" followed by ""just trying to be supportive"" is a classic example of chandler's dry, somewhat inappropriate humor. he's likely responding to a conversation about breakups in a way that's meant to be funny rather than genuinely supportive.

the juxtaposition of talking about missing someone after breaking up with them, combined with the awkward addendum about trying to be supportive, creates a sarcastic tone. it's a typically chandler way of diffusing tension or responding to emotional situations with humor, often missing the mark in terms of actual support but landing squarely in the realm of sarcasm.",1.0

the input text doesn't appear to contain sarcasm. chandler's statement seems to be a straightforward expression of resignation or helplessness in a situation where he feels he has no control. the language is direct and doesn't contain any obvious irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would typically indicate sarcasm. the tone and content align with a genuine admission of inability to influence the situation, rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

this statement appears to be a straightforward, literal expression of someone's perceived inability or powerlessness. without additional context or cues that might suggest irony or exaggeration, it's best to interpret this as a non-sarcastic, albeit negative and discouraging, comment.

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the provided cues and the content of the input text, i believe this conversation is not sarcastic. here's why:

1. the text appears to be a straightforward recounting of a conversation between chandler and monica about decorating their balcony.

2. the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical for sitcom dialogue, but doesn't indicate sarcasm.

3. while chandler uses the word ""funny,"" it's more likely expressing genuine amusement or coincidence rather than sarcasm.

4. the disagreement between chandler and monica about the balcony lights seems genuine, with chandler presenting a logical argument for why lights might encourage people to use the balcony despite the cold.

5. there's no obvious irony or mocking tone in the text that would suggest sarcasm.

6. the emotional contrasts in the text (excitement vs. reluctance, optimism vs. pessimism) are presented in a straightforward manner without any apparent sarcastic undertones.

therefore, i conclude that this text is not sarcastic. it appears to be a sincere retelling of a conversation about decorating a balcony, typical of the kind of dialogue you might find in a sitcom like ""friends.""",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is a simple, repetitive dialogue line where chandler is calling out janice's name twice.
2. there's no apparent contrast or irony that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the use of question marks indicates genuine questioning or searching, which is typically not associated with sarcasm.
4. without additional context, this appears to be a straightforward call-out, possibly chandler looking for or trying to get janice's attention.
5. sarcasm usually requires more context or a more complex sentence structure to be apparent, which is not present in this brief dialogue.

therefore, i conclude that this line is most likely not sarcastic, but rather a genuine call or query from chandler to janice.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the exclamation ""crazy bitch!"" by chandler appears to be a direct, emotionally charged outburst rather than a sarcastic statement. the use of strong, derogatory language and the exclamation mark indicate genuine anger or frustration. sarcasm typically involves irony or saying the opposite of what is meant, which doesn't seem to be the case here. the cues suggest this is a straightforward, albeit harsh, expression of negative emotion without any apparent sarcastic intent.",0.0

 JOEY: That book got me through some tough times
 PERSON: There is a little child inside this man.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of hyperbole in chandler's statement, exaggerating that removal would cause death, is a classic indicator of sarcasm. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the context of the tv show ""friends,"" and this line fits his typical comedic style. the extreme nature of the claim, combined with the exclamation point, further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0
CHANDLER: And I just won a million dollars!,"ROSS: I don't want to be single. I just, I just want to be married again.
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

based on the cues provided and the context of the statement, i believe the label for this input is ""sarcastic."" here's my reasoning:

1. the statement is likely hyperbole, as noted in the rhetorical devices cue. winning a million dollars is often used as an exaggerated example of good fortune in casual conversation.

2. the name ""chandler"" suggests this might be from the tv show ""friends,"" where the character chandler bing is known for his sarcastic humor.

3. the exclamation and the seemingly abrupt nature of the statement (starting with ""and"") suggest it might be a reaction to something, possibly in a sarcastic or ironic manner.

4. in sitcoms and casual conversation, suddenly claiming to have won a large sum of money is often used sarcastically to express that something unlikely or fortunate has happened, or to deflect from a previous statement or situation.

5. without more context, and given chandler's typical character if this is indeed from ""friends,"" it's more likely that this is a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine statement of having won money.

therefore, considering these factors, i believe the most appropriate label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the question posed by chandler appears to be a genuine inquiry about someone's ability to crack a code. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the text. the tone seems more uncertain or doubtful rather than sarcastic. the phrasing is straightforward and lacks the typical exaggeration or irony associated with sarcastic statements. therefore, it's most likely a sincere question without sarcastic intent.",0.0

explanation: the statement appears to be a genuine expression of concern from chandler about the potential loss of party guests to a competing event. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would typically indicate sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a straightforward worry about the party's success, which is consistent with the character's personality if this is indeed from a tv show (likely ""friends,"" given the character name chandler). the statement is direct and reflects a plausible concern in the given situation, without any sarcastic undertones.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

the input text appears to be a genuine expression of realization and loneliness from the character chandler. while chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends,"" this particular line doesn't exhibit typical markers of sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a moment of sincere self-reflection.

the use of ""oh, wait a minute"" suggests a sudden realization, followed by the statement ""i have no one,"" which expresses a feeling of loneliness or isolation. the tone and content align with a straightforward, non-sarcastic utterance. the emotional contrast between initial excitement and subsequent disappointment further supports the authenticity of the statement.

given the context provided and the nature of the statement, it's most likely that this is a genuine, non-sarcastic moment for chandler, possibly serving as a poignant or comedic beat in a larger scene or storyline.",0.0

the text appears to be a straightforward statement from chandler about his smoking habits. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the content or structure of the sentences. the language is simple and direct, describing a continuation of behavior from yesterday to today. the use of ""actually"" at the beginning suggests sincerity rather than irony. the repetition of ""smoking"" emphasizes the ongoing nature of the habit without any apparent sarcastic undertones. given these factors and the lack of any contradictory or exaggerated elements typically associated with sarcasm, it's reasonable to conclude that this statement is not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this line appears to be a straightforward realization by chandler, rather than a sarcastic statement. he initially thinks he has something, then quickly corrects himself as he remembers taking it out of his shirt earlier. the ""oh no"" and self-correction are typical of genuine recollection, not sarcasm. the informal, conversational tone and stream-of-consciousness style support a sincere, non-sarcastic dialogue.",0.0
"CHANDLER: I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.","RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there!
",FRIENDS,1,"given the context and the nature of the statement, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. it references a well-known public service announcement (psa) from the 1970s featuring a native american man shedding a tear due to pollution.

2. chandler's suggestion that littering might summon this figure to ""save"" them is absurd and not meant to be taken literally.

3. the idea of intentionally littering to get help contradicts the entire message of the original psa, which was against littering.

4. this type of dry, ironic humor is very characteristic of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends.""

the use of the psa reference in this unexpected and contradictory way is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning. chandler is not actually suggesting littering as a solution, but rather making a joke that highlights the absurdity of their situation.",1.0

2. the context suggests chandler is expressing worry about something not making sense.
3. there's no clear indication of irony or contradiction that would typically signal sarcasm.

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""nope, that patch is no good"" is a straightforward expression of disapproval or rejection. there's no apparent contradiction between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which is typically a hallmark of sarcasm. the language is direct and informal, consistent with chandler's character (if this is from the tv show ""friends""), but it doesn't display the irony or mocking tone often associated with sarcastic remarks. the speaker is simply stating their opinion about the quality or usefulness of a patch, without any evident sarcastic undertones.",0.0

explanation:
the statement ""hey, my father's house does that."" appears to be a straightforward, casual comment made by chandler in a conversation. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief statement. the tone seems informal and matter-of-fact, as chandler is simply pointing out a similarity between something being discussed and a feature of his father's house. without additional context or cues suggesting a sarcastic tone or intent, it's most appropriate to classify this statement as not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the context and tone of the question suggest a sarcastic or humorous intent rather than a literal inquiry.
2. the exaggerated nature of the question (linking lateness to burying a woman) is more likely to be a sarcastic comment than a genuine concern.
3. the character chandler, often associated with the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor.
4. the casual tone and unexpected connection between being late and burying someone aligns with typical sarcastic speech patterns.
5. without additional context, the absurdity of the situation (casually asking about burying someone) points towards a sarcastic interpretation rather than a serious accusation.

while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that this line is intended to be sarcastic rather than a literal question.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""i am so confused as to what we have been doing so far"" is a straightforward expression of genuine confusion. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the language is direct and sincere, matching the emotional cue of confusion. the informal, conversational style and use of first-person perspective further support that this is a genuine expression of chandler's state of mind rather than a sarcastic remark.",0.0

the statement appears to be a straightforward description of a t-shirt with a self-deprecating message. while the t-shirt's slogan itself could be considered ironic or humorous, chandler's statement about the t-shirt doesn't contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. he's simply describing the shirt's content without any apparent sarcastic tone or context.",0.0

 JOEY: I like that!
 MONICA: So what do you say?
 CHANDLER: No
 MONICA: Just do it!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the most appropriate label for this text is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the repetition of ""oh oh"" at the beginning of the sentence suggests exaggeration, which is often a marker of sarcasm.
2. the exclamation ""i am convinced!"" seems overly emphatic, especially when combined with the repeated ""oh oh."" this overemphasis is frequently used in sarcastic statements.
3. the character chandler, if referring to chandler bing from ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor, which adds context to this interpretation.
4. the abrupt and exaggerated nature of the statement, without any supporting information about what convinced him, hints at a sarcastic tone rather than genuine conviction.

while it's possible this could be a genuine expression of being convinced, the combination of the repetition, exclamation, and the character's typical manner of speaking (if it is indeed chandler from ""friends"") strongly suggests a sarcastic intent.",1.0

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. sudden mood shift: chandler goes from asking for time to wake up to suddenly being very animated and amused.

2. exaggerated reaction: his ""ha ha!"" and enthusiastic response to someone losing the ring is overly cheerful for what would normally be a concerning situation.

3. contradictory statement: calling someone the ""worst best man ever"" is a sarcastic oxymoron, emphasizing the irony of a best man losing the ring.

4. context: this fits chandler's character, known for his sarcastic humor in the show ""friends"".

the contrast between his initial sleepy state and sudden gleeful reaction to a mistake reinforces the sarcastic tone. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this text.",1.0

5. the juxtaposition of a casual conversation opener with an outlandish scientific question creates a sarcastic tone.

while the sarcasm is subtle, it's consistent with the character's typical speech patterns and the show's style of humor.",1.0

reasoning: based on the cues provided and the nature of the dialogue, this line is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. context: the cues mention this is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic humor.

2. situational irony: the statement ""stop catching on fire"" is absurd advice, creating humor through the contrast between a serious tone (""i'm sorry man"") and the bizarre suggestion.

3. delivery: the pause indicated by "".."" suggests a comedic timing, setting up the unexpected punchline.

4. content: the idea of someone repeatedly catching on fire is so outlandish that it's clearly not meant to be taken literally, but as a humorous exaggeration.

5. tone: while ""sorry"" typically expresses sympathy, in this context it's used to set up the sarcastic punchline, subverting the expected serious tone.

therefore, chandler's statement is undoubtedly sarcastic, employing his characteristic wit to create humor through an unexpected and absurd suggestion.",1.0

sarcastic

the response ""oh i left them in my bulldozer .. i don't have tools!"" is clearly sarcastic. chandler is using irony to emphasize that he doesn't own tools, let alone a bulldozer. this kind of exaggerated, absurd statement is a classic example of sarcasm, especially common in sitcom dialogue.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the use of hyperbole (""tons"") and the exaggerated claim ""i am quite the woodsman"" suggest chandler is likely not being sincere.
2. the informal, conversational tone and short, succinct sentences are consistent with a sarcastic delivery.
3. the character chandler (likely from the tv show ""friends"") is known for his sarcastic humor.
4. without additional context, claiming to be ""quite the woodsman"" in a modern setting (as implied by the character's name) seems out of place and likely intended as a joke.
5. the exaggeration serves a comedic purpose, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

while we can't be 100% certain without more context, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that chandler is being sarcastic in this statement.",1.0

sarcastic

this quote from chandler is a clear example of sarcasm. it fits perfectly with the cues provided, expressing frustration with someone's lack of verbal filter in a witty, indirect way. the sarcasm lies in the implication that there should be ""something"" (i.e., a brain or common sense) to control what the person says, when in reality, everyone has such a mechanism but this particular person doesn't seem to use it effectively. this kind of dry, sarcastic humor is very characteristic of chandler's character in the show ""friends.""",1.0

### label: not sarcastic

the short line ""no, rabies."" spoken by chandler does not contain clear indicators of sarcasm. without additional context, it appears to be a straightforward, factual statement or response. the brevity and directness of the statement suggest it's likely meant to be taken at face value rather than interpreted sarcastically. however, it's important to note that sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect in isolated short statements, especially without tone of voice or broader context.",0.0

 ROSS: I went to their tanning place your wife suggested.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the question ""was that place the sun?"" is likely not meant to be taken literally. it's improbable that chandler actually believes a place they visited was the sun.

2. the character chandler (likely from the tv show ""friends"") is known for his sarcastic humor and witty remarks.

3. the question seems to be exaggerating the characteristics of a place, possibly implying it was extremely hot, bright, or uncomfortable.

4. while the text itself is brief, the nature of the question and its absurdity in a literal sense strongly suggests sarcastic intent.

5. this type of hyperbolic question is a common form of sarcasm used to emphasize a point or express discomfort in a humorous way.

therefore, considering chandler's character traits, the nature of the question, and the likely context, this statement is most probably intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine inquiry.",1.0

the statement by chandler exhibits classic elements of sarcasm, using exaggeration and absurd imagery to create humor. the description of legs flailing ""as if independent from his body"" creates a vivid, comical contrast with the expectation of normal bodily control. this hyperbolic description is characteristic of sarcastic humor, especially in the context of a sitcom character like chandler from ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic quips.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this line is clearly sarcastic. chandler's comment is a prime example of his characteristic sarcastic humor. he's using the rhetorical question and the allusion to ""fraggle rock"" to mock the unusual name ""hornswoggle"" in a humorous and exaggerated way. the tone and content of the statement, particularly the comparison to a children's show character, are unmistakably sarcastic.",1.0

 ROSS: Okay, I think its time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the statement by chandler is clearly an exaggerated, darkly humorous response to a minor annoyance. the extreme disproportion between joey eating chandler's last piece of gum and chandler claiming to have killed him for it is a classic setup for sarcasm. 

the juxtaposition of the trivial offense (eating gum) with the severe overreaction (murder), followed by the nonchalant question about whether it was wrong, creates a satirical tone that's characteristic of sarcasm. this kind of hyperbolic statement is also very much in line with chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic humor.

the cues provided also support this interpretation, noting the darkly humorous tone and the extreme overreaction described. therefore, i'm confident in labeling this statement as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

the input text is indeed sarcastic. while chandler starts with a seemingly sincere statement (""it was an accident""), he immediately follows it with an exaggerated, humorous scenario that contrasts sharply with the initial seriousness. this juxtaposition of a straightforward explanation with an absurd image (being across the street with a telescope and donuts) is a classic example of chandler's sarcastic wit from the tv show ""friends.""

the sarcasm serves to deflect from the seriousness of the situation and mock the idea that his actions were intentional or premeditated. this type of humor, combining self-deprecation with absurdist imagery, is quintessential chandler and clearly falls into the category of sarcasm.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the language style and context provided, as well as my understanding of the character chandler from the tv show ""friends"" and his tendency for sarcastic remarks, i can confidently assign the label:

the exclamation ""dear god"" combined with the unexpected observation about the parachute being a knapsack is a classic example of chandler's dry, sarcastic humor. he's likely pointing out a dangerous or absurd situation in his characteristically witty manner.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reason for this judgment is:

1. the use of extreme exaggeration: ""seventeen zillion dollars"" is an impossibly large and nonsensical amount, clearly not meant to be taken literally.

2. the casual tone contrasting with the absurd claim: starting with ""oh yeah ok"" and then mentioning such an outrageous sum creates a humorous disconnect typical of sarcasm.

3. the context of friendly banter: the mention of ""waffles last week"" suggests an ongoing, informal tally between friends, which is then comically inflated to an absurd degree.

4. the character context: if this is indeed from a tv show featuring a character named chandler (likely from ""friends""), this type of sarcastic humor is very consistent with that character's typical speech patterns.

these elements combined strongly indicate that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically, not literally.",1.0

sarcastic

chandler's statement is a clear example of sarcasm. the absurdity of looking for someone to draw on him with chalk is not meant to be taken literally, but rather used as a humorous and exaggerated response. this fits perfectly with the definition of sarcasm, where the speaker says something that is the opposite of what they actually mean, often for comedic effect or to express frustration or criticism indirectly.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given information and cues, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

reasons for this judgment:

1. the use of both a question mark and an exclamation point in such a short statement often indicates exaggeration or dramatic emphasis, which are common in sarcastic expressions.

2. the content of the statement itself is quite extreme (""die alone""), which is often used in sarcastic or hyperbolic statements for comedic effect.

3. this line is from chandler, a character from the tv show ""friends"" who is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.

4. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""me?"" and then immediately following with a dramatic statement, is a common format for delivering sarcastic lines.

given these factors, particularly chandler's character tendency and the punctuation cues, this statement can be confidently labeled as sarcastic.",1.0

3. the follow-up ""okay yes i see how they got there"" is a deadpan acknowledgment of an obviously ridiculous situation, which is a common sarcastic technique.

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a very short story or fragment with a simple narrative structure.
2. it uses straightforward language and common story elements (characters, setting, resolution).
3. there are no obvious indicators of irony or sarcasm in the language or content.
4. the abrupt transitions and fairy tale-like ending (""and then the kingdom was his. the end."") suggest a whimsical or absurdist style rather than sarcasm.
5. the emotional progression from loneliness to triumph, while sudden, doesn't imply sarcastic intent.
6. the use of rhetorical devices like personification and apostrophe are typical in storytelling and don't necessarily indicate sarcasm.

while there is a contrast between chandler downplaying the importance of what he needs to do and then suddenly exclaiming ""get up,"" this doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm. instead, it appears to be a case of chandler trying to minimize the interruption he's about to cause before realizing or deciding that he needs to act more urgently. the tone seems more apologetic and then suddenly urgent rather than sarcastic.",0.0

chandler's statement is clearly sarcastic. he's exaggerating the idea of parental cruelty by applying it to something trivial like the flatness of a pillow. this hyperbole is a classic hallmark of sarcasm, using an overly dramatic tone to mock the idea of parents being truly cruel over such an insignificant issue. the word ""cruel"" is used ironically here, contrasting with the minor nature of pillow flatness, which further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0

the line ""oh! satan's minions at work again?"" spoken by chandler is clearly sarcastic. it's a hyperbolic and humorous way of commenting on a negative situation, likely in response to some frustrating event or obstacle. the use of ""satan's minions"" is an exaggerated reference that's not meant to be taken literally, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic remarks. this type of quip is also very much in line with chandler's character (assuming this is chandler from the tv show ""friends""), who is known for his sarcastic humor.",1.0

this line is clearly sarcastic. chandler, a character known for his sarcastic wit, is making a joke by suggesting that some unspecified situation or items could be part of a ridiculous promotional contest. the phrase ""collect all five"" is typically associated with marketing gimmicks or children's toys, which makes it humorous when applied to an apparently unrelated and likely more serious context. this mismatched application of a trivial concept to what is presumably a more complex situation is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0

the text displays several hallmarks of sarcasm:

1. wordplay: the phrase ""predicament room"" is a clever play on ""emergency room,"" which is typical of sarcastic humor.

reasoning:
1. the use of ""oh, um"" suggests hesitation or uncertainty, which contrasts with the emphatic ""i don't care!""

5. the emotional contrast noted in the cues suggests that chandler might actually care but is expressing the opposite.

while it's difficult to be absolutely certain without more context, the combination of these factors leans towards a sarcastic interpretation of the statement.",1.0
"CHANDLER: You know once you are inside, you don't have to knock anymore.","JOEY: Hey
 CHANDLER: Hey
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the given context and input, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the line appears to be a sarcastic comment from the character chandler, likely from the tv show ""friends"". it uses humor to point out an obvious social norm (that you don't need to knock once you're already inside) in a playfully mocking way, which is characteristic of sarcasm and chandler's character.",1.0
CHANDLER: We think it was trying to spell out monkey.,"ROSS: He also found an M and an O.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious rhetorical devices or figurative language that might indicate sarcasm.
2. there's no clear emotional contrast or exaggeration that often accompanies sarcastic statements.
3. the tone appears to be casual and informative, simply relaying an observation about something trying to spell ""monkey.""
4. without additional context that might suggest an ironic or contradictory situation, the statement seems to be a literal description of an event or observation.

therefore, based on the information available, this statement appears to be a non-sarcastic, literal comment made by the character chandler.",0.0
CHANDLER: Dee. The sarcastic sister from What's Happening.,"CHANDLER: Could you want her more?
 ROSS: Who?
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

this line appears to be a straightforward reference to a character from a tv show, without any evident sarcasm in the statement itself. chandler is simply identifying or describing a character named dee from the show ""what's happening,"" noting her characteristic of being sarcastic. the statement itself is not employing sarcasm, but rather making a factual reference to a sarcastic character.",0.0
"CHANDLER: Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved and not they're all recommending Trident?","ROSS: Who?
 CHANDLER: Dee, the sarcastic sister from What's Happening!!
 RACHEL: Guys, guess what guess what guess what.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this line from chandler is clearly sarcastic. it cleverly plays on the well-known advertising claim that ""4 out of 5 dentists recommend"" a certain product, typically trident gum. by humorously suggesting that the holdout fifth dentist has finally agreed, chandler is using sarcasm to mock this common marketing tactic. the sarcasm is evident in the way he presents this unlikely scenario as if it were a genuine, newsworthy development, when in fact he's pointing out the absurdity of such claims.",1.0
CHANDLER: Ah your own brand of vigilante justice.,"JOEY: Did you call the cops?
 RACHEL: No, we took her to lunch
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the tone and phrasing of chandler's comment strongly suggest sarcasm.
2. multiple cues mention that this line is likely a sarcastic remark.
3. the use of ""ah"" at the beginning of the sentence often indicates a sarcastic or ironic tone.
4. the phrase ""your own brand of vigilante justice"" is an exaggerated way to describe someone's actions, which is a common sarcastic technique.
5. chandler's character is described as witty and prone to using sarcasm in the cues provided.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" accurately describes the nature of this dialogue line.",1.0

 CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i believe this judgment is reliable based on the following reasons:

1. context: this appears to be dialogue from a tv show or script, likely the sitcom ""friends"" given the character name monica.

2. content: monica is comparing something (presumably something that is actually considered big or significant) to having a third nipple, which is an exaggerated and absurd comparison.

3. contradiction: she starts by saying ""no its not big, not at all"" and then immediately makes a comparison that implies it is, in fact, a big deal.

4. punctuation: the exclamation mark at the end emphasizes the dramatic and exaggerated nature of the statement.

5. tone: the overall tone of the statement, with its casual dismissal followed by an outlandish comparison, is consistent with sarcastic humor.

these elements combined strongly suggest that monica is being sarcastic in this statement, using irony to emphasize that whatever she's referring to actually is a big deal.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text contains a joke made by chandler, which is characteristic of his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends."" the rhetorical question and the self-aware comment about being ""allowed one joke in the monkey is penis genre"" are clear indicators of sarcasm. the tone is lighthearted and meant to be humorous, which aligns with the sarcastic nature of the character and the situational comedy of the show.",1.0

 RACHEL: What did you just say?

 RACHEL: No, no, no, the love part? Oh my god!
",FRIENDS,1,"label: sarcastic

this statement by joey is clearly sarcastic. the suggestion to ""keep rubbing your head"" as a way to ""turn back time"" is not meant to be taken literally. it's an absurd and impossible action presented as if it were a genuine solution, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the tone is mocking and implies the futility of trying to change something that has already happened. without further context, this line appears to be joey making a sarcastic comment about someone's useless or ineffective attempts to undo or change a past event.",1.0

reasoning:

2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in the wording.

the text ""joey: ok!"" is a simple, straightforward affirmative response. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the exclamation mark suggests enthusiasm or agreement, but doesn't imply any sarcastic undertones. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic acknowledgement or agreement.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the text is very brief and straightforward, without any clear indicators of sarcasm.
2. the exclamation ""great!"" appears to be a genuine positive response.
3. the cues mention an informal, conversational tone, which aligns with sincere speech rather than sarcasm.
4. there's no context provided that would suggest any irony or hidden meaning behind chandler's words.

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward expression of fear or anxiety by rachel in response to something scary she's watching. the language used, emotional content, and context all align with a genuine reaction of fear, without any indicators of sarcasm or irony. the exclamation ""oh boy"" and the statement ""it's too scary!"" are consistent with sincere expressions of discomfort or fright, rather than sarcastic commentary.",0.0

 ROSS: Yeah?
 JOEY: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input text ""ross: yeah it would!"", i don't have enough context to confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. the exclamation point suggests enthusiasm, which could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context of the conversation.

however, given that we're asked to choose a label, and considering that sarcasm typically requires more context or a more obvious contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, i will cautiously assign the label:

not sarcastic

this label is chosen because:
1. the statement is brief and straightforward.
2. there's no obvious irony or contradiction in the words themselves.
3. the exclamation point suggests genuine enthusiasm rather than sarcasm.

however, i want to emphasize that this classification is made with low confidence due to the lack of contextual information. in a real conversation, sarcasm often depends heavily on tone, previous context, and the relationship between speakers, none of which we have access to here.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input ""yeah."" and the cues given, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

rationale:
1. the response is very brief and neutral, lacking any clear indicators of sarcasm.
2. ""yeah"" is a casual, informal affirmative response commonly used in everyday conversation.
3. there are no contextual cues, exaggerated language, or emotional contrasts that might suggest sarcasm.
4. without additional context or tone information, it's most appropriate to interpret this straightforward response at face value.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, there's simply not enough information here to justify labeling this short response as sarcastic. therefore, the safer and more likely correct interpretation is that it's a genuine, non-sarcastic affirmation.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i cannot determine if this text is sarcastic or not. the statement ""monica: what? why?"" is too brief and lacks context to accurately judge whether it's sarcastic or not. sarcasm typically requires more context or a fuller statement to be identifiable. without additional information about the conversation or situation, it's impossible to confidently label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic.",0.0

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as ""not sarcastic."" the exclamation ""oh! oop!"" from phoebe appears to be a genuine, spontaneous reaction expressing surprise or possibly a minor mistake. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would typically signal sarcasm. the brevity and informality of the expression, along with the use of exclamation marks, suggest a sincere, in-the-moment response rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0

 JOEY: I gotta go check something over here.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the information provided and the context of the cue, i can confidently assign a label to this input.

label: sarcastic

the phrase ""what a baby"" used by chandler is clearly sarcastic. it employs hyperbole, as noted in the cue, to exaggerate someone's behavior or reaction, likely implying that they're being overly sensitive or immature. this kind of statement is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning (actually calling someone a baby) is used to convey a critical or mocking attitude towards someone's behavior. in chandler's case, given his character in the show ""friends,"" this type of sarcastic comment is very much in line with his typical humor and speech patterns.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this text:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the input text ""joey: i talk to you and nothin'."" appears to be a straightforward expression of frustration rather than sarcasm. the cues indicate that joey is expressing genuine frustration about a lack of response or engagement from someone he's trying to communicate with. the informal language and truncated sentence structure suggest a direct, emotional statement rather than a sarcastic remark. while sarcasm can sometimes be used to express frustration, in this case, the brevity and directness of the statement point more towards a literal expression of disappointment or annoyance with the communication situation.",0.0
MONICA: Do you still wanna call  'em? I wanna call  'em.,"JOEY: Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
 CHANDLER: Y'know who has a great video camera?

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward expression of enthusiasm from monica about wanting to call someone. there's no evidence of irony, contradiction, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm. monica seems genuinely eager to make the call and is checking if the other person still wants to do so as well. the repetition of ""wanna call 'em"" reinforces her sincere desire rather than indicating any sarcastic intent. therefore, based on the content and tone of the dialogue, i would label this as ""not sarcastic"".",0.0

 RACHEL: Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement appears to be a straightforward, casual remark from rachel about discarding something she believes contains shampoo. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in her tone or word choice. the informal language (""gonna,"" trailing off with ""and..."") suggests a genuine, offhand comment rather than a sarcastic one. without any obvious contradiction between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, or any exaggeration for effect, this statement is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the input text ""joey: so, you're just bing?"" appears to be a straightforward question without any indicators of sarcasm. joey seems to be genuinely inquiring about the identity of the entity they're talking to, likely in the context of interacting with an ai assistant or chatbot associated with bing. the tone is neutral and inquisitive, lacking the typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. therefore, this statement can be classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

this statement appears to be a straightforward instruction or direction, likely in a context such as a rehearsal, audition, or filming scenario. rachel is directing others to stop the current action (""cut"") and restart the selection or performance process (""pick again""). the repetition of ""pick again"" emphasizes the instruction but doesn't indicate sarcasm. the tone is direct and functional, typical of someone in a leadership or directorial role, without any apparent irony or hidden meaning that would suggest sarcasm.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given information and cues, i believe the most appropriate label for this input is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement appears to be a straightforward comment about sensitivity.
2. there are no clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that typically characterize sarcasm.
3. the informal, conversational tone suggests a sincere remark rather than a sarcastic one.
4. without additional context, it's safer to interpret this as a literal statement about sensitivity rather than assuming sarcasm.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and with only this single line of dialogue, we can't be absolutely certain of the speaker's intent. the label ""not sarcastic"" is the most reasonable interpretation based on the limited information available.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this line of dialogue from ross exhibits clear sarcasm. the rhetorical question ""for what?"" followed by a statement referencing a negative past event (being thrown out of an office) strongly suggests a sarcastic tone. ross is likely not genuinely asking for clarification, but rather expressing frustration or resentment over the past incident in a mocking way. the confrontational tone and use of a rhetorical question are typical markers of sarcastic speech in this context.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the context provided, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
monica's statement ""like i have nothing better to do!"" is a classic example of sarcasm. the phrase ""nothing better to do"" is often used sarcastically to imply the opposite - that the person actually has many other important things they could be doing. the exclamation point adds emphasis to the sarcastic tone. the cue mentioning ""frustration or annoyance"" in monica's response further supports this interpretation, as sarcasm is often used to express these emotions indirectly.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the analysis of the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the use of the metaphorical phrase ""gravy train"" and the emphatic repetition of ""that"" contribute to a sarcastic tone in monica's statement. she's expressing frustration about the situation in a way that's not entirely literal, using figurative language to make her point more forcefully and humorously. this combination of rhetorical devices and the context of the situation (switching apartments and ending free access to food) strongly indicate that monica is being sarcastic in her delivery of this line.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text ""monica: what?!?!"" is a brief exclamation expressing surprise or shock.
2. the multiple punctuation marks (question mark and exclamation points) indicate genuine emotional intensity.
3. there's no context or additional information that suggests any irony or hidden meaning.
4. sarcasm typically involves saying something opposite to what is meant, often with a mocking or critical tone. this exclamation appears to be a straightforward expression of surprise.
5. the cues indicate an emphatic, emotional response, which is more consistent with genuine shock than sarcasm.

therefore, based on the available information, this exclamation is most likely not sarcastic, but rather a genuine expression of surprise or disbelief.",0.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the repetition of ""ross"" and the exclamation mark indicate genuine excitement or emotion.
2. the phrase ""you have no idea what this means to me"" is commonly used to express sincere gratitude or appreciation.
3. there are no contextual clues or linguistic markers that suggest sarcasm or irony.
4. the cues mention that rachel seems to be expressing strong gratitude or excitement, which aligns with a non-sarcastic interpretation.
5. the emotional contrast noted in the cues (excitement/gratitude vs. assumption of lack of understanding) is consistent with a genuine, non-sarcastic expression of feelings.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of gratitude or excitement from rachel to ross, without any sarcastic intent.",0.0

this appears to be a straightforward question asked by the character chandler, likely from the tv show ""friends."" the question doesn't contain any obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. it's a simple, genuine inquiry about what to give a child who wants a ""ticket to play,"" which could refer to various activities or events. the informal, conversational tone and the lack of emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices further support that this is a non-sarcastic, literal question.",0.0

the statement ""oh sure, go with the sissy"" demonstrates clear sarcasm. the use of ""oh sure"" in this context is typically a sarcastic way of expressing disagreement or disapproval. the informal language, coupled with the potentially derogatory term ""sissy,"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone. this line appears to be a dismissive and sarcastic response, likely in a dialogue where joey is expressing frustration or mockery towards someone's choice or action.",1.0

the statement ""you'd better act surprised"" appears to be a straightforward instruction or advice from joey to someone else. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this short sentence. the context suggests that joey is genuinely telling someone to pretend to be surprised about something, likely an upcoming event or revelation that the person already knows about. this kind of statement is common in situations where maintaining the illusion of surprise is important for social reasons or to avoid disappointing someone else. without any contradictory tone or context clues, this statement should be taken at face value as a sincere instruction, not a sarcastic remark.",0.0

 CHANDLER: I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not that close. I haven't seen him in years.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the tone and context of monica's statement indicate genuine concern and agitation about a potentially problematic situation. the use of capitalization, punctuation, and the rhetorical question format all point to sincere emotional urgency rather than sarcasm. monica appears to be seriously worried about the consequences of someone finding out they were excluded, which is not consistent with a sarcastic intent.",0.0
"RACHEL: Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.","PHOEBE: No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
 RACHEL: I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
 PHOEBE: Not after this!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given context and cues, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the tone appears to be straightforward and reassuring rather than mocking or contradictory.
2. rachel is telling others to relax and then affirming that she herself is relaxed (""i doooo""), which seems consistent rather than sarcastic.
3. the elongated ""doooo"" suggests emphasis or sincerity rather than a sarcastic tone.
4. there are no clear indicators of irony or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
5. the casual, informal language style is consistent with genuine reassurance in a friendly conversation.

without additional context that might reveal contradictory information or a reason for sarcasm, the statement appears to be a genuine attempt to calm others down and express rachel's own relaxed state.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward, casual question from rachel. she's using informal language and slang, which is typical in conversational speech. the phrase ""y'know what i mean"" and the use of ""like"" as a filler word suggest she's seeking confirmation or clarification about a term (""dubbies"") that she assumes might be familiar to the listener. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm. the context and language style point to a genuine, non-sarcastic inquiry.",0.0

 JOEY: Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the available information and context cues, i believe the most appropriate label for this input is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends.""
2. the brevity and simplicity of the statement could be indicative of dry, deadpan sarcasm.
3. without more context, complimenting someone on a ""hole"" seems unusual, which often signals sarcasm.
4. the use of ""excellent"" as an emphatic descriptor can be a common sarcastic device, especially when delivered in a certain tone.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and without more information about the tone, situation, or surrounding dialogue, this interpretation is based on the most likely scenario given chandler's character and typical use of language in similar situations.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided information and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""i studied for a year in barcelona"" is a straightforward, factual declaration without any indicators of sarcasm.
2. there are no emotional contrasts or exaggerations that might suggest sarcastic intent.
3. the language style is simple, concise, and informative, typical of sincere statements about personal experiences.
4. no rhetorical devices or figurative language are used that might imply a sarcastic tone.
5. the punctuation is standard and doesn't indicate any special emphasis or hidden meaning.

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and the short input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the statement ""rachel: just tell me how."" is a straightforward request for information or instructions. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this brief line. the tone suggests urgency or possibly frustration, but it lacks the irony, exaggeration, or contradictory elements typically associated with sarcastic statements. the directness and simplicity of the request align more closely with a non-sarcastic communication style.",0.0

 PHOEBE: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

the text doesn't appear to be sarcastic. ross is expressing his genuine discomfort and preference in a direct, emphatic manner. while there's some exaggeration for effect (""naked, greasy strangers""), this is more for emphasis and humor rather than sarcasm. the statement aligns with a sincere expression of his desires for his living space, contrasting what he doesn't want (strangers) with what he does want (relaxation with a puzzle and cold beer). the informal, colloquial style and the emphasis on ""cold beer"" further support that this is a straightforward, albeit colorful, expression of ross's feelings rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0
ROSS: We- we had our first fight this morning.,"MONICA: Do you always have to bring him here?
 ROSS: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and cues, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward declaration by ross about having a fight.
2. there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the use of ""fight"" aligns with the emotional cue provided, indicating a genuine expression of conflict.
4. the context appears to be ross simply reporting an event that occurred, without any sarcastic undertones.

therefore, this statement seems to be a sincere communication about a relationship issue, not a sarcastic remark.",0.0

 PERSON: Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
 JOEY: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

the statement ""nobody sees the king!"" does not appear to be sarcastic based on the available information and cues. here's why:

1. the exclamation mark indicates emphasis or strong emotion, but not necessarily sarcasm.
2. the statement is a hyperbole, which can be used for emphasis without being sarcastic.
3. there's no clear contrast between the literal meaning and an implied meaning, which is often present in sarcastic statements.
4. the tone seems to convey secrecy, exclusivity, or possibly frustration, but these emotions don't inherently indicate sarcasm.
5. without additional context, the statement appears to be a straightforward declaration about the inaccessibility of the king.

while sarcasm often relies on context and tone that may not be fully captured in text, the given information doesn't provide enough evidence to classify this statement as sarcastic. therefore, the most appropriate label based on the available information is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

sarcastic

the statement ""it's not a real game! i made it up!"" clearly demonstrates chandler revealing that he had been deceiving others about the existence of a game. this aligns perfectly with the cues provided, showing a contrast between deception and truth. the exasperated tone implied by the exclamation marks further supports the sarcastic nature of the revelation. chandler is likely frustrated or annoyed at having to admit his deception, which is a common context for sarcastic remarks.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement contains exaggerated encouragement and an unexpected shift in tone, which are typical elements of sarcasm. phoebe's suggestion to ""stop being such a wuss"" and watch naked dancers is likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous or ironic comment. the contrast between the initial hesitation implied by ""wuss"" and the boldness of the suggested action further supports the sarcastic interpretation.",1.0

 MONICA: Pete, can I get you something else?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this statement.

### label: sarcastic

the text displays several characteristics of sarcasm:

1. humor: the speaker combines a normal food order (cheesecake) with an unexpected request (a date), treating both as if they were menu items.

2. casual, playful tone: the informal language and conversational style suggest a lighthearted approach.

3. implied absurdity: the idea of a restaurant ""giving out"" dates as if they were food items is clearly not meant to be taken literally.

4. subtle flirtatiousness: the speaker is using humor to potentially express interest in a date, but in a way that can be easily played off as a joke if not well-received.

the combination of these elements, particularly the use of humor to make an absurd request while maintaining plausible deniability, is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. the speaker is not seriously expecting to be offered a date along with their cheesecake, but is using this sarcastic comment to potentially break the ice or add humor to the interaction.",1.0
ROSS: It's not funny!,"ROSS: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Okay? Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the exclamation mark indicates strong emotion or emphasis.
2. the emotional contrast between expressed anger/frustration and implied amusement is a common feature of sarcastic statements.
3. the phrase ""it's not funny!"" is often used sarcastically when someone actually finds something amusing but is trying to maintain a serious facade, or when they're annoyed that others find something funny that they don't.
4. the context of this being dialogue (indicated by ""ross:"") suggests it's part of a larger conversation or situation where sarcasm would be more likely to occur.

while it's possible this could be a genuine expression of frustration, the combination of these factors, especially the emotional contrast, points more strongly towards a sarcastic interpretation.",1.0

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""yeah, i'm fine"" is a common, straightforward response in everyday conversation.
2. there's no clear indication of sarcasm or irony in this brief statement.
3. while the phrase can sometimes be used to mask true feelings, we don't have enough context to assume that's the case here.
4. the informal and brief nature of the response is typical in casual conversation and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm.
5. without additional context, tone information, or contradictory cues, it's most appropriate to interpret this statement at face value.

therefore, based on the limited information available, the most reasonable interpretation is that rachel's statement is not sarcastic.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the line ""well, don't 'cha wanna?"" spoken by monica appears to be a genuine question asked in an informal, friendly manner. the colloquial language and the use of contractions suggest a casual conversation rather than a sarcastic remark. the emotional cues indicate eagerness or excitement, which aligns with a sincere question rather than sarcasm. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement doesn't contain clear indicators of sarcasm, irony, or mocking tone that are typically associated with sarcastic comments.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment include:

1. the use of euphemism ""breakfast adventure"" to likely refer to an intimate encounter, which adds a layer of indirect criticism.

2. the overall tone of chandler's statement is sarcastic, implying criticism of the situation and its consequences.

3. the phrase ""your little breakfast adventure"" has a dismissive and mocking quality, typical of sarcastic comments.

4. the contrast between the formal ""i believe the piece of furniture was fine"" and the informal, accusatory tone of the rest of the statement creates a sarcastic effect.

5. chandler's character is known for his sarcastic quips in the context of the tv show ""friends,"" which this dialogue appears to be from.

these elements combine to create a statement that is clearly sarcastic in nature, using humor and indirect language to express disapproval or criticism.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuine expression of surprise and concern from rachel about the prospect of staying married forever. the stuttering (""what-wh-what"") and the questioning tone indicate genuine shock or bewilderment rather than sarcasm. the emotional cues suggest confusion and potential distress, which aligns with a sincere reaction to an unexpected situation regarding her marriage. the language style and punctuation also support a spontaneous, emotional response rather than a sarcastic one. therefore, this statement is best classified as not sarcastic.",0.0

 PERSON: What is going on?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the input text and the available cues, i can provide a direct response:

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the text appears to be a brief dialogue snippet featuring a character named ross expressing confusion or agitation. the repetition of ""what's going on"" and the use of multiple exclamation points suggest genuine emotional intensity rather than sarcasm. ross seems to be reacting to something unexpected or alarming, and his response appears to be a straightforward expression of confusion and frustration. without additional context that might suggest irony or a mismatch between the words and the intended meaning, there's no clear indication of sarcasm in this short exchange.",0.0
JOEY: Weā€™re not peeking?,"PERSON: Come on!

this label is chosen because:

1. the text is a simple question without any obvious indicators of sarcasm.
2. the cues mention that it's a line of dialogue from a character named joey, suggesting it's likely a straightforward question in context.
3. there are no clear emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices that might indicate sarcasm.
4. the language style is described as informal and colloquial, which is typical for non-sarcastic dialogue.
5. without more context, the question ""we're not peeking?"" appears to be a genuine inquiry rather than a sarcastic statement.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, there are no clear indicators in this brief text or the provided cues that would suggest a sarcastic intent. therefore, ""not sarcastic"" is the most appropriate label for this input.",0.0

 JOEY: A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this line is likely sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the contrast between the age (29) and the dismissive attitude towards a savings account creates irony. at 29, most people are expected to be financially responsible.

2. the phrase ""who needs a savings account"" is likely meant ironically, as savings accounts are generally considered important for financial stability.

3. the character chandler, if this is indeed from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic humor.

4. the casual ""y'know"" and the rhetorical question format add to the sarcastic tone, implying that the statement shouldn't be taken at face value.

the sarcasm here serves to highlight the character's self-awareness about financial responsibility while humorously downplaying its importance, which is typical of chandler's character and the show's style of humor.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text demonstrates clear sarcastic undertones. phoebe's rhetorical question is not seeking genuine information, but rather expressing skepticism or criticism about someone's musical abilities. the exaggerated phrasing ""sing and play guitar and do both at the same time"" suggests phoebe is mocking or belittling these skills, likely in response to someone else's praise or admiration. this use of exaggeration and rhetorical questioning are common indicators of sarcasm, especially in the context of informal, conversational dialogue.",1.0

1. the text is a simple, polite expression of gratitude.
2. there's no context or additional information suggesting any sarcastic intent.
3. the brevity and straightforwardness of the statement align with a sincere ""thank you.""

explanation:
the text ""monica: you had no relationship!!"" appears to be a direct, emphatic statement rather than a sarcastic one. the use of all caps for the name, double exclamation marks, and the forceful denial all indicate genuine emotion and confrontation. sarcasm typically involves irony or saying the opposite of what is meant, which is not evident here. instead, this seems to be a straightforward, emotionally charged assertion in what is likely an argument or heated discussion about a past relationship.",0.0

the repetition of ""okay"" at the end, combined with ross's assertion that he doesn't always have to be okay, suggests a sarcastic tone. the statement appears to be pushing back against an expectation or assumption, likely with some frustration or irony. the informal speech pattern and use of repetition for emphasis further support this interpretation. while sarcasm can be subtle and context-dependent, the structure and tone of this statement lean towards a sarcastic delivery.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

this judgment is based on several factors:

1. the context suggests this might be a line from a tv show or movie, likely from the character chandler in ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic humor.

2. the question format, combined with the seemingly exaggerated scenario of protecting something from a tornado, hints at a sarcastic tone.

3. while there's no explicit emotional content, the phrasing suggests skepticism or disbelief, which is often associated with sarcasm.

4. the cues mention that this could be a ""sarcastic/humorous remark, possibly in response to an exaggerated claim,"" which aligns with the content of the question.

without more context, it's impossible to be absolutely certain, but given chandler's character traits and the nature of the question, it's more likely to be a sarcastic comment than a genuine inquiry about tornado protection.",1.0

given the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently say that this statement is not sarcastic. the text appears to be a genuine expression of pain and discomfort from someone experiencing a leg cramp. the repetitive use of ""ow"" and ""leg cramp"" emphasizes the intensity of the pain, and there are no contradictory elements or subtle humor that would suggest sarcasm. the language is straightforward, expressing a common physical ailment without any hidden meaning or irony.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the context provided, i can confidently assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

the statement by phoebe exhibits a sarcastic tone. she's making a humorous and exaggerated claim about how repeating someone's name will eventually make them turn around, regardless of how many times it takes. this oversimplification of human behavior is typical of sarcastic remarks, especially when delivered in a sitcom context like ""friends,"" where phoebe is known for her quirky and often sarcastic observations.

the repetition mentioned in the cues supports this interpretation, as it's being used here not for earnest emphasis, but to humorously exaggerate the supposed effectiveness of the tactic phoebe is describing.",1.0

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a line from a script or tv show, featuring a character named joey.
2. the phrase ""squatternut buash"" is clearly a mispronunciation of ""butternut squash,"" which is likely intentional for comedic effect.
3. the use of a malapropism (misusing a word for a similar-sounding one) is a common technique in comedy and often associated with sarcasm or irony.
4. the question mark at the end suggests joey is recounting this mispronunciation with a tone of disbelief or amusement, which is consistent with sarcastic delivery.
5. the context of recounting a humorous linguistic mix-up is often used in sitcoms or comedic scenes, where sarcasm and irony are common elements.

while the sarcasm may not be overtly aggressive, the overall context and delivery suggest that this line is meant to be humorous and somewhat sarcastic, poking fun at the mispronunciation.",1.0

2. there's no apparent contradiction or irony in the text that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the tone is casual and friendly, typical of sincere everyday conversation.
4. the action of giving something (""here you go"") aligns with the positive sentiment expressed, showing no discrepancy that might indicate sarcasm.

label: not sarcastic

the input text ""ross: you and i, we're interfacing."" appears to be a straightforward statement without any clear indicators of sarcasm. while the use of ""interfacing"" in this context is somewhat unusual and could be seen as a euphemism or an attempt at humor, it doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm. the statement seems to be using technical language in a casual context, which is more likely meant to be humorous or characterizing of the speaker rather than sarcastic. without additional context that might contradict the literal meaning or tone of this statement, it's best to interpret it as a non-sarcastic comment about two people interacting or communicating.",0.0

the text displays situational irony, which is a common element of sarcasm. phoebe is explicitly stating that she's going to act in a way that contradicts her true feelings, which is a hallmark of sarcastic behavior. the exclamation point at the end also adds emphasis that could be interpreted as sarcastic exasperation. the contrast between her outward appearance and inner feelings, as well as the irony in her statement, strongly suggest a sarcastic tone.",1.0

explanation:
while chandler's statement does contain some elements that could be interpreted as contradictory or downplaying (describing the relationship as both ""nothing"" and ""goofin' around""), the overall context and language style suggest this is more likely a genuine attempt to casually define or minimize a relationship rather than a sarcastic comment. the informal language, use of filler words, and conversational tone all point to a sincere, albeit awkward, attempt at communication rather than sarcasm. the emotional contrast noted in the cues seems to reflect chandler's actual conflicted feelings or attempt to navigate a potentially sensitive topic, rather than a sarcastic intent.",0.0

3. the ""ah-ha-ha!!"" at the end suggests genuine enthusiasm or sudden realization rather than sarcasm.
4. there's no clear indication of irony or saying the opposite of what is meant, which are key components of sarcasm.
5. the context suggests chandler is transitioning from a sleepy state to an alert one, expressing genuine surprise or amusement.

reasoning:
1. the text is a brief line of dialogue without enough context to clearly indicate sarcasm.
2. while phoebe's response suggests frustration or disappointment, this alone doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm.
3. the exclamation and use of ""apparently"" indicate surprise or contradiction, but these can be genuine reactions rather than sarcastic ones.
4. without a clear contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typical in sarcasm, it's safer to assume the statement is not sarcastic.

the statement appears to be a straightforward, casual request made in a social setting. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. the language is informal and direct, consistent with friendly conversation. the mention of ""guys"" having a ""crush"" on chloe seems to be stated matter-of-factly rather than sarcastically. without additional context suggesting otherwise, this statement comes across as a genuine, non-sarcastic remark.",0.0

 CHANDLER: Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
 PHOEBE: Okayyyyy, open up!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the current cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the contrast between the expectation (something to be shown) and the reality (only seeing a van) suggests a sarcastic tone.

2. the use of ""bitchin"" to describe the van in this context seems to be ironic or exaggerated, further indicating sarcasm.

3. the rhetorical question ""what did you want to show us?"" combined with the statement about only seeing the van implies a sarcastic or ironic tone.

4. the overall structure of the statement, setting up an expectation and then subverting it with an unexpected observation, is a common format for sarcastic comments.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle and context-dependent, the elements present in this short statement strongly suggest a sarcastic intent.",1.0

CHANDLER: Lovely,"MONICA: No.
 CHANDLER: How long have we been home?
 MONICA: About a half an hour.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the limited context provided and the cues available, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

rationale:
1. the single word ""lovely"" is generally used to express genuine appreciation or positivity.
2. without additional context that might suggest irony or contradiction, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a straightforward, sincere comment.
3. the cues indicate a positive tone and simple, everyday language, which aligns with a non-sarcastic use of ""lovely.""
4. there's no indication of emotional contrast or rhetorical devices that might suggest sarcasm.

however, it's important to note that sarcasm can be highly context-dependent, and with such limited information, this judgment is based on the most likely interpretation of the available data.",0.0

2. the language is informal and conversational, typical of sincere speech.

4. the use of filler words like ""well ah"" suggests natural, unscripted speech rather than crafted sarcasm.

therefore, this statement appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic expression of personal reflection.",0.0

 CHANDLER: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
 MONICA: What?!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the metaphor used (""i'm the ruptured spleen"") is highly unusual and exaggerated, which is a common trait of sarcastic statements.
2. the character chandler, likely referring to the character from ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.
3. the use of such a dramatic medical condition (ruptured spleen) to describe oneself is likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a humorous or sarcastic way of expressing discomfort, uselessness, or pain.
4. the informal speech and self-deprecating tone noted in the language style analysis are consistent with sarcastic delivery.

while the context is limited, the combination of these factors strongly suggests that this line is intended to be sarcastic rather than a literal statement.",1.0

### label: not sarcastic

the exclamation ""oh-oh"" and the description of something as a ""risky little game"" appear to be a genuine expression of concern or surprise rather than a sarcastic statement. the tone seems to be one of genuine wariness or excitement about a potentially risky situation, without any clear indicators of irony or sarcasm. the exclamation mark adds emphasis to the statement, reinforcing the speaker's sincere reaction to whatever ""game"" is being referred to.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the message is a simple, neutral greeting without any context or additional information.
2. there's no emotional contrast, unusual punctuation, or rhetorical devices that might indicate sarcasm.
3. the language style is described as informal, brief, and casual, which is typical for a normal, non-sarcastic greeting.

",FRIENDS,0,"not sarcastic

this text appears to be a genuine expression of distress, denial, or panic from rachel. the repetition, fragmented speech, and use of negations all point to a sincere emotional reaction rather than a sarcastic statement. the cues provided, particularly the analysis of emotional content and speech patterns, support this interpretation. rachel seems to be genuinely upset or in disbelief about something, which is not consistent with sarcasm. therefore, the appropriate label for this input is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

### label: not sarcastic

the exclamation ""whoa, maybe i was!"" by joey appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or sudden realization rather than a sarcastic statement. the use of ""whoa"" as an interjection and the exclamation mark at the end indicate sincerity in joey's reaction. without additional context suggesting otherwise, this statement seems to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic response to something joey has just realized about himself or a situation.",0.0

 MONICA: Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the content is absurd and exaggerated: a lifeguard dismantling a nuclear device is not a realistic scenario, which is a common technique used in sarcasm.

2. the casual delivery of an extraordinary claim: chandler presents this outlandish situation in a nonchalant manner (""anyway, i should go""), which is typical of deadpan sarcasm.

3. pop culture context: this line is likely from the tv show ""friends,"" where chandler is known for his sarcastic humor.

4. the extracted language style information supports a humorous or sarcastic interpretation, particularly noting the ""humor/sarcasm"" cue that mentions the likelihood of exaggeration or joke.

5. the use of hyperbole (extreme exaggeration) is a common sarcastic device, which is evident in the notion of a lifeguard handling a nuclear device.

therefore, this statement is clearly intended to be sarcastic rather than literal.",1.0

 CHANDLER: I'm free! I'm free!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the limited information provided in the input text and the current cues, i cannot confidently determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the line ""that oughta do it"" spoken by phoebe is too brief and lacks sufficient context to make a definitive judgment about its sarcastic nature.

however, if i must choose a label, i would lean towards:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""that oughta do it"" is a common colloquial phrase often used sincerely to indicate the completion of a task.
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, contradiction, or obvious irony in this short statement.
3. without additional context or tone indicators, it's more likely that this is a straightforward comment rather than a sarcastic one.

it's important to note that this classification is made with low confidence due to the lack of context. in a different scenario or with more information, this statement could potentially be sarcastic.",0.0

the input text ""joey: hey."" is a simple, neutral greeting that doesn't contain any indicators of sarcasm. based on the cues provided and the brevity of the message, there's no reason to interpret this as sarcastic. it's a straightforward, casual greeting without any context or additional information that would suggest sarcastic intent. therefore, the correct label is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

 ROSS: No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the given input and the detailed cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward, though hesitant, admission from ross about the existence of ""someone else"" in a likely romantic context. the hesitation (""umm""), repetition (""there's-there's""), and informal language all point to a genuine, nervous attempt to convey potentially difficult information. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrasting elements that would typically characterize sarcasm. the emotional tone and context suggest this is a sincere, albeit uncomfortable, revelation rather than a sarcastic statement.",0.0
"CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.","ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
 CHANDLER: So, let's go.
 ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe the correct label for this statement is ""not sarcastic."" here's my reasoning:

1. the statement appears to be a straightforward attempt by chandler to justify staying somewhere, using politeness as a reason.

2. while there might be a very mild form of irony present (as chandler could be using politeness to mask his real reasons for wanting to stay), this doesn't rise to the level of sarcasm.

3. the language style is described as informal, persuasive, and indirect, but not sarcastic or overtly humorous.

4. there are no clear rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that would typically indicate sarcasm.

5. the emotional tone (considering politeness and avoiding rudeness) seems genuine rather than mocking or insincere.

6. without broader context that might suggest chandler is known for sarcastic remarks or that this statement contradicts his usual behavior, it's safer to interpret this as a sincere, albeit possibly convenient, excuse.

therefore, based on the available information, this statement appears to be ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
"PERSON: Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.","ROSS: Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
 RACHEL: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available cues and the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement creates a contrast between a relatively short time period (21 hours) and the grand title of ""hero,"" which is often associated with much more significant or long-term achievements. this contrast can be indicative of sarcasm.

2. the use of antithesis, as noted in the rhetorical devices cue, supports a sarcastic interpretation. the dramatic effect created by contrasting a brief time with heroic status often serves sarcastic purposes.

3. the informal tone and colloquial expression ""you're a hero"" can be used sarcastically in casual conversation to exaggerate or mock someone's perceived accomplishment.

4. without further context, calling someone a ""hero"" for a 21-hour effort seems hyperbolic, which is a common feature of sarcastic statements.

5. the brevity and directness of the statement align with typical sarcastic comments, which often rely on succinct delivery for impact.

while it's possible this could be a genuine compliment in a specific context, the combination of these elements strongly suggests a sarcastic tone.",1.0

not sarcastic

the statement ""it's my friends"" appears to be a straightforward, sincere reference to phoebe's friends. there are no indicators of sarcasm in this brief line. the cues suggest it's a simple, direct statement in a casual conversation. without any context suggesting irony or contradiction, and given the typically positive connotations of the word ""friends,"" it's most likely that phoebe is speaking genuinely about her friends.",0.0

",FRIENDS,0,"given the context and emotional contrast described in the cues, as well as the exclamatory and accusatory nature of monica's statement, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the strong emotional outburst (""no!!"") followed by the hyperbolic accusation (""you have been screwing us all day!"") suggests an exaggerated, sarcastic response. the contrast between implied prior positive interaction and the current anger/frustration further supports this interpretation. monica's statement is likely an over-the-top, sarcastic reaction to express frustration rather than a literal accusation.",1.0

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a straightforward, sincere statement from rachel explaining an accidental action. the language is informal and hesitant, with rachel trying to clarify that she didn't intend to touch something. the use of ""i did not mean to"" and the trailing off with ""i mean"" suggest genuine regret or embarrassment rather than sarcasm. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contrast that would typically be present in sarcastic statements. the context and tone align with a sincere apology or explanation for an unintended action.",0.0

 PERSON: What?
 ROSS: Stupid balls are in the way.
",FRIENDS,0,"sarcastic

the statement by ross appears to be sarcastic based on several cues:

1. the use of ""oh well"" at the beginning suggests resignation or disappointment.
2. the phrase ""most constructive solution"" is used in contrast with the apparent fact that this solution wasn't implemented, creating an ironic tone.
3. the language analysis indicates a potential for sarcasm or dry humor in the statement.
4. the context, though limited, implies that ross is commenting on a missed opportunity or rejected idea, likely with a hint of frustration or criticism.

the combination of the resigned ""oh well"" with the positive description of a solution that wasn't used strongly suggests that ross is being sarcastic about the situation, subtly criticizing the decision not to use what he considers the best approach.",1.0

2. there's no context provided that would suggest any irony or contradiction that might indicate sarcasm.
3. the exclamation mark suggests enthusiasm or emphasis, but not necessarily sarcasm.

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the repetition of ""yeah"" followed by a statement about needing a ""good .. pill"" suggests a sarcastic tone.
2. the ellipsis (..) indicates a pause or hesitation, which can be used to emphasize sarcasm.
3. the informal, conversational tone and fragmented sentence structure are often associated with sarcastic speech.
4. without more context, suggesting a ""good pill"" as a solution could be interpreted as a sarcastic comment, implying that medication isn't actually the answer to whatever problem is being discussed.
5. the character phoebe, in many contexts (such as the tv show ""friends""), is known for her quirky and sometimes sarcastic remarks.

JOEY: Okay?,"JOEY: I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the available cues and the input text ""joey: okay?"", i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is extremely brief and lacks context, making it difficult to infer sarcasm.
2. ""okay?"" is a neutral expression that can be used in various situations without inherent sarcasm.
3. there are no clear indicators of emotional contrast, exaggeration, or irony that typically accompany sarcastic statements.
4. the punctuation (question mark) suggests a genuine query or seeking confirmation, which is not inherently sarcastic.
5. without additional context or tone indicators, it's most appropriate to interpret this statement at face value as a simple question or confirmation request.

not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of frustration rather than sarcasm. phoebe is genuinely struggling to find rhymes for someone's name and is expressing her difficulty and exasperation directly. the use of ""stupid name"" seems more like casual venting rather than a sarcastic remark. the context suggests this is part of a sincere, if frustrated, attempt at creative writing or wordplay.",0.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the given text ""rachel: what was that?!"" is a straightforward expression of surprise or alarm. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the exclamation is genuine and direct, lacking any contradictory tone or ironic context that would suggest sarcasm. the use of both a question mark and exclamation point (?!) emphasizes the speaker's genuine shock or confusion, which is typically inconsistent with sarcastic intent.",0.0

3. there's no context or language that implies irony or contradiction.

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the information provided and my analysis of the text, i believe the correct label for this input is:

not sarcastic

the given input ""i just called a friend of mine"" is a straightforward statement without any indicators of sarcasm. based on the cues provided, including the language analysis, lack of emotional contrasts or rhetorical devices, and the simple, neutral nature of the statement, this appears to be a literal, non-sarcastic comment about a recent action. the sentence is too brief and direct to contain any hidden meanings or ironic undertones that would suggest sarcasm.",0.0

### explanation:
based on the limited context provided, there's not enough information to definitively conclude that this statement is sarcastic. the exclamation point suggests emphasis or strong emotion, but that doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm. rachel appears to be making an emphatic statement about something continuing or being true even with people present or involved. without more context, it's safer to interpret this as a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement.",0.0
ROSS: I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I,"ROSS: Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided input and cues, i can confidently assign a label:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is brief and straightforward.
2. ross is expressing an apology with ""i'm really sorry,"" which aligns with the cue identifying ""sorry"" as the main emotional word.
3. there's no context or tone that suggests sarcasm or insincerity.
4. the incomplete sentence ""it's just that i"" suggests ross is about to explain or elaborate on his apology, which is typically sincere behavior.
5. the use of ""really"" before ""sorry"" emphasizes the sincerity of the apology.

given these factors, the statement appears to be a genuine expression of regret or apology, not a sarcastic remark.",0.0

",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

### explanation:

based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i believe this statement is likely sarcastic. here's why:

1. the rhetorical question format: the statement is phrased as a question but isn't actually seeking an answer. this is often used in sarcastic remarks.

2. the phrase ""i guess"": this often indicates a sarcastic or ironic tone, implying that the speaker is feigning uncertainty about something they actually believe is obvious.

3. the redundancy: saying ""being one of the two of us"" is unnecessarily specific, which can be a hallmark of sarcasm.

4. the tag question ""right?"": this adds emphasis and seems to be seeking confirmation of something that should be obvious, which is often used sarcastically.

5. the overall structure: the statement appears to be pointing out something that should be self-evident to the person being addressed, which is a common sarcastic technique.

while context is limited, the combination of these elements strongly suggests that rachel is making a sarcastic comment, likely in response to something the other person said or did that rachel finds obvious or unnecessary to state.",1.0

 PHOEBE: Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
 CHANDLER: What?
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuine, albeit humorous, explanation from a character named phoebe. while the situation described is somewhat absurd (being put in jail for trying to stop a sale), it doesn't exhibit the hallmarks of sarcasm. the language is straightforward, expressing regret (""i'm sorry"") and an attempt to intervene (""i tried to stop it""). the exclamation at the end conveys genuine surprise or distress rather than sarcastic intent. the hyperbole about being put in jail is likely used for comedic effect in a fictional context, but it's not delivered sarcastically. the overall tone suggests sincerity in recounting an unusual event, rather than using irony or mockery typical of sarcasm.",0.0
"PERSON: Almost! But first, we gotta start.","RACHEL: All right, I'm outta here!
 MONICA: I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
 RACHEL: So were done then!
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the analysis of the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently assign the following label:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text ""almost! but first, we gotta start."" appears to be a straightforward, enthusiastic statement rather than a sarcastic one. the exclamation ""almost!"" suggests genuine excitement or anticipation, and the following statement is a simple, direct instruction. the informal tone (""gotta"") and the use of exclamation mark indicate sincerity rather than sarcasm. there are no clear indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would typically signal sarcasm. the statement seems to be a casual, friendly communication about beginning a task or process.",0.0
CHANDLER: You building a post office?,"JOEY: Hey, we know how we always say we need a place for the mail? Well I started building one, but then, I decided to take it to the next step.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the context of the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the character chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, especially in the tv show ""friends.""
2. the question ""you building a post office?"" is likely not meant to be taken literally. it's probably a rhetorical question used to comment on someone's actions in a humorous or exaggerated way.
3. the informal, conversational tone and use of a rhetorical question are often indicators of sarcasm in dialogue.
4. without more context, it's reasonable to assume that chandler is making a sarcastic remark about someone's behavior or the size/complexity of whatever they're working on, rather than genuinely inquiring about post office construction.

while there's always a possibility of misinterpretation without full context, given chandler's character and the nature of the question, classifying this as sarcastic is the most likely interpretation.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the limited context provided in the input text ""ross: uh yes! thank you."" and the current cues available, i believe the most appropriate label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the response is brief and straightforward, expressing agreement (""yes"") followed by gratitude (""thank you"").
2. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggerated language, contradictory statements, or context that would suggest the opposite meaning.
3. the cues mention that there are no clear emotional contrasts, which are often present in sarcastic statements.
4. the expression appears to be a genuine, positive response to something (though we lack the full context).

without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement seems to be a sincere expression of agreement and thanks, hence the ""not sarcastic"" label.",0.0

this line appears to be a genuine expression of concern or surprise from monica about someone's facial appearance. the combination of the question mark and exclamation point (interrobang) suggests a tone of shock or alarm rather than sarcasm. without additional context that might suggest an ironic or mocking intent, it's most reasonable to interpret this as a straightforward, non-sarcastic question expressing worry or astonishment about something unusual monica has noticed on someone's face.",0.0

1. the statement is a straightforward expression of desire for assurance or certainty.
2. there are no clear rhetorical devices or contrasting emotions that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the language style is informal and direct, but not indicative of sarcasm.

this statement is a direct, heartfelt declaration of love from monica to someone. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the use of superlative language (""never loved anybody as much"") and the straightforward expression of intense emotion (""i love you"") suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm. in the absence of contradictory context or tone indicators, this statement should be taken at face value as a genuine expression of deep affection.",0.0

1. the statement appears to be a straightforward request from joey.
2. there are no clear rhetorical devices or emotional contrasts that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the language style is informal and direct, typical of sincere spoken dialogue.

the tone appears neutral and matter-of-fact rather than mocking or ironic, which are common hallmarks of sarcasm. the casual language (""wanna"" instead of ""want to"") suggests a conversational, sincere tone rather than a sarcastic one.

without more context, it's difficult to detect any underlying sarcastic intent. the statement seems to simply express that labeling something is optional and up to the other person's preference. therefore, the most appropriate label for this text is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

label: not sarcastic

explanation:
the exclamation ""but i'm the host!"" by joey appears to be a genuine expression of surprise, frustration, or protest rather than a sarcastic statement. the context suggests that joey sincerely believes he is the host and is reacting to a situation where his role or authority is being questioned or overlooked. the use of the exclamation mark and the contrasting ""but"" at the beginning indicate emotional emphasis rather than irony or sarcasm. without additional context that might suggest a mocking or ironic tone, this statement comes across as a straightforward assertion of joey's perceived role.",0.0

 CHANDLER: No. We were in the middle of sex .. and
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the dramatic shift from strong denial (""nooo! no, that's not true."") to extreme positivity (""no, best time ever! yeah, you rocked my world!"") is a classic hallmark of sarcasm.

2. the excessive use of exclamation marks (4 in total) emphasizes an exaggerated emotional response, which is often associated with sarcastic speech.

3. the contrast between the initial negative reaction and the sudden, over-the-top praise creates a sense of insincerity typical of sarcastic comments.

4. the phrase ""you rocked my world"" in this context seems hyperbolic and insincere, further supporting the sarcastic interpretation.

these elements collectively suggest that monica is not genuinely praising the experience but rather using sarcasm to express her displeasure or disappointment.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the exclamation mark and the use of ""seriously"" suggest genuine surprise or excitement.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or contrast that would typically signal sarcasm.
3. the statement appears to be a straightforward, emphatic observation about something moving.
4. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that rachel is expressing genuine astonishment or urgency about whatever is moving.

the brief, excited nature of the comment and the lack of any contradictory cues point towards a non-sarcastic interpretation. rachel seems to be sincerely amazed or alarmed by something that is moving.",0.0

the text appears to be a straightforward statement from monica about a phone call she received from carol. there are no indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements. the tone is neutral and informative, simply relaying the sequence of events: carol called to thank monica for the lasagna, monica asked about it (likely because she had forgotten), and carol explained. this aligns with the context provided in the cues, which suggest monica had made lasagna for carol but had forgotten about it until the call. the language style, lack of emotional contrasts, and absence of strong emotional words further support that this is a literal, non-sarcastic statement.",0.0

 PHOEBE: Ohh! You made up!
 MONICA: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
",FRIENDS,0,"based on the provided context and cues, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the line ""yeah, she couldn't live without the chan love"" appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of exaggeration: saying someone ""couldn't live without"" something is often a hyperbolic statement used in sarcasm.

2. self-referential humor: chandler refers to himself in the third person as ""chan,"" which is likely a playful or self-deprecating nickname.

3. the phrase ""chan love"" itself sounds like a humorous or ironic way to refer to chandler's affection or appeal.

4. the context suggests this is from a sitcom or comedy show, where sarcasm is a common form of humor.

5. chandler, as a character (likely from the tv show ""friends""), is known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.

the combination of these elements strongly indicates that this line is meant to be interpreted sarcastically, rather than as a sincere statement.",1.0

 ROSE: You seem a little nervous.
 DOROTHY: Oh you're sure I am
 ROSE: Are you nervous cause you haven't met Michael's fiancee?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the analysis of the rhetorical device and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement by dorothy uses hyperbole and absurd imagery to mock the idea of sonny bono (a former entertainer) becoming mayor. the exaggerated claim about changing postal workers' uniforms to outlandish 1970s-style clothing is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but rather to humorously express skepticism about bono's qualifications or potential actions as a political figure. this kind of exaggerated, absurd statement used to make a point is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0
"DOROTHY: Oh yes Blanche, about a half hour ago. But now I have hidden her again so you can find her.","BLANCHE: Have you found her?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward statement from dorothy to blanche, likely part of a casual conversation or possibly a script. while the context suggests they might be playing a game or engaging in some playful activity involving hiding and finding, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in the language used. the tone is direct and informative, without any apparent irony or mocking undertones that would typically characterize sarcastic speech.",0.0
"DOROTHY: I don't know Rose, maybe Marry Poppins has an Italian cousin.","ROSE: Isn't she happy here?
 DOROTHY: I think she will be happy with Gloria
 ROSE: What about us? Whose gonna keep after us. Make us linguini and tell us story about Cicily.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

the input text displays characteristics of sarcasm for several reasons:

1. unexpected connection: the speaker, dorothy, is making an unlikely and humorous connection between mary poppins (a fictional british character) and having an italian cousin. this unexpected juxtaposition is often a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

2. speculative tone: the use of ""maybe"" suggests a non-serious, speculative tone that is often present in sarcastic comments.

3. context clues: while we don't have the full context, the statement seems to be a response to something rose said earlier, likely using sarcasm to playfully dismiss or counter a point.

4. pop culture reference: using a well-known character like mary poppins in an absurd scenario (having an italian cousin) is a common technique in sarcastic humor.

5. informal language: the casual, conversational tone (""i don't know, rose"") is consistent with the delivery of a sarcastic remark.

given these elements, the statement appears to be a sarcastic comment rather than a sincere speculation about mary poppins' family tree.",1.0

 DOROTHY: Later Stan told me that he put my engagement ring in the bottom of the glass
 DOROTHY: It turned up three days later.
 ROSE: Where did it turn up Dorothy?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"not sarcastic

this label is based on the following reasoning:

1. the input text is very brief and straightforward, simply stating that dorothy is on the home shopping network.

2. there's no clear indication of irony, exaggeration, or any other elements typically associated with sarcasm.

3. the context provided doesn't suggest any underlying meaning or contrast that might imply sarcasm.

4. home shopping networks are a common and legitimate form of television programming, so mentioning it doesn't inherently suggest any sarcastic intent.

5. without additional context or tone indicators, it's most appropriate to interpret this statement literally.

therefore, based on the available information, this statement appears to be a simple, non-sarcastic reference to dorothy being on a home shopping network, either as a viewer, a topic of discussion, or possibly as a presenter.",0.0

 BLANCHE: I guess you are still upset with me about last night aren't you?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the given cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

this label is appropriate for the following reasons:

1. the text contains nonsensical elements (""crocodin turbs""), which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
2. the statement expresses being upset over something trivial or nonsensical, which is a common sarcastic technique.
3. the informal speech and short, declarative sentence structure are consistent with sarcastic delivery.
4. the context appears to be part of a dialogue or script, suggesting it could be a humorous or sarcastic line.
5. the juxtaposition of a serious emotion (being upset) with an absurd reason (fictional creatures wearing darker colors) creates the kind of incongruity often found in sarcastic statements.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that the statement is meant to be understood as sarcastic rather than literal.",1.0
DOROTHY: The liberarche marquee at Caesar's palace,"DOROTHY: Whop, it is really coming down.

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the cues provided and the input text, i believe i can make a reliable judgment.

### label: not sarcastic

the input text ""dorothy: the liberarche marquee at caesar's palace"" appears to be a straightforward statement or description, likely from a script or dialogue. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contrasting emotions. the text seems to be simply referring to a marquee (possibly misspelling ""liberace"") at caesar's palace, which is a well-known casino in las vegas. without any additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement comes across as a neutral, non-sarcastic observation or line of dialogue.",0.0

### label: sarcastic

this response is clearly sarcastic. the statement suggests an absurd scenario (sitting in extremely hot weather to eat enchiladas) as if it were a serious answer. the exaggeration of the temperature (112 degrees) and the impractical nature of the described action strongly indicate sarcasm. the character dorothy is likely responding to a question or statement with this sarcastic remark to emphasize how unlikely or undesirable the suggested action would be.",1.0

### label: not sarcastic

the input text appears to be a straightforward line of dialogue from a script or play. dorothy is addressing blanche and making a statement about a venus fly trap. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief exchange. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than ironic or mocking, which are common elements of sarcastic speech. without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's most appropriate to interpret this line as a non-sarcastic statement.",0.0
"DOROTHY: No Rose, go to the corner and open a stand","ROSE: Shall I set this down someplace?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the following label:

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward instruction from dorothy to rose.
2. there are no clear emotional contrasts or exaggerations that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the language is direct and literal, without any obvious irony or hidden meanings.
4. the context, while limited, suggests a practical scenario of setting up a stand, which doesn't inherently imply sarcasm.
5. there are no linguistic markers typically associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole or contrasting tone indicators.

therefore, without additional context that might suggest otherwise, this statement appears to be a genuine, non-sarcastic instruction.",0.0
DOROTHY: Lords of Arabia,"DOROTHY: Well ofcourse Blanche , they did it in that movie.
 ROSE: What movie?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the limited information provided in the input ""dorothy: lords of arabia"" and the cues given, i cannot confidently determine whether this text is sarcastic or not sarcastic. the phrase appears to be a title or heading, possibly for a book, film, or other media, but there's not enough context to detect any sarcastic intent.

without more context or additional information about the tone, intent, or surrounding content, it would be inappropriate to label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. the text itself is neutral and doesn't contain any obvious markers of sarcasm.

therefore, i cannot assign a label of 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic' to this input with any degree of confidence.",0.0

 ROSE: You worried she might be Gina's?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the given input and the current cues provided, i believe the correct label for this text is:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward expression of worry from dorothy.
2. there's no apparent irony or contradiction between what's said and what's meant.
3. the emotional word ""worried"" is used in a direct, sincere manner.
4. the language style is informal and colloquial, but not in a way that suggests sarcasm.
5. there are no clear rhetorical devices or exaggerations that might indicate sarcasm.
6. the statement expresses genuine concern about someone potentially being associated with ""phir resuda.""

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, there are no clear indicators in this brief statement that would suggest it's meant to be taken as anything other than a sincere expression of worry. therefore, i believe classifying it as ""not sarcastic"" is the most appropriate label.",0.0

 SOPHIA: Is that Paolo?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the cues provided and the content of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: not sarcastic

explanation: while the statement is humorous and likely involves a misunderstanding or mishearing (referring to ""girl scout toilets"" instead of the more common ""girl scout cookies""), it doesn't exhibit the hallmarks of sarcasm. the speaker, dorothy, appears to be genuinely clarifying a misunderstanding to her mother. the absurdity of the statement comes from a likely verbal mix-up rather than intentional irony or mockery, which are typical of sarcasm. the informal, conversational tone and the straightforward manner of correction suggest sincerity rather than sarcastic intent.",0.0
"DOROTHY: No, I haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.","PERSON: Sophia was discharged, is she here?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and factual, without any obvious irony or exaggeration typically associated with sarcasm.
2. the tone is neutral and informative, simply answering a presumed question about the status of someone or something in the car trunk.
3. there are no clear emotional words, rhetorical devices, or emotional contrasts that might suggest sarcastic intent.
4. the language style is conversational and direct, which aligns more with a sincere response rather than a sarcastic one.
5. without additional context that might imply an unusual or inappropriate situation, this statement appears to be a literal response to an inquiry.

therefore, based on the available information, this statement is most likely not sarcastic.",0.0

 SOPHIA: Are you referring to me?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

this line appears to be sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the absurdity of the claim: it's highly unlikely that a famous actor like cary grant would be living in a broom closet.

2. the casual tone: dorothy's ""ofcourse no ma"" suggests she's responding to disbelief with exaggerated certainty, which is often a marker of sarcasm.

3. the context: while limited, the context implies this is likely a humorous or nonsensical statement, not meant to be taken literally.

4. the misspelling of ""cary"" as ""carrey"": this could be intentional to add to the absurdist humor of the statement.

5. the informal, conversational style: sarcasm is often employed in casual, informal speech.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that dorothy is being sarcastic, likely making a joke or using hyperbole to make a point, rather than stating a literal fact.",1.0
"DOROTHY: How about stopping by new years eve with three naked women, throwing up in the pool, passing out in the punch bowl, and relieving yourself in the linen closet?","DOROTHY: We thought you might like to join us for dinner?

",GOLDENGIRLS,0,"based on the provided context and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text is clearly an example of sarcastic dialogue. dorothy is using exaggerated and outrageous examples of inappropriate party behavior to make a point, likely criticizing someone's actions or mocking the idea of acceptable party conduct. the extreme nature of the described actions (arriving with naked women, vomiting in a pool, passing out in a punch bowl, urinating in a linen closet) is a strong indicator of sarcasm, as these are not behaviors anyone would seriously suggest or condone for a new year's eve party.",1.0
"DOROTHY: No Rose, at a pie eating contest.","DOROTHY: Oh I am so nervous. Have you ever given an eulogy?
 ROSE: You mean at a funeral?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

the text ""dorothy: no rose, at a pie eating contest."" appears to be sarcastic based on the following cues:

1. the conversational tone and informal speech suggest a sitcom-like dialogue.
2. the brief, snappy response is typical of sarcastic remarks.
3. the analysis indicates a use of sarcasm or wit in the language style.
4. the context of a pie eating contest being mentioned in such a direct, deadpan manner implies a humorous or sarcastic intent.
5. the structure of the response (starting with ""no rose,"") suggests that dorothy is correcting rose in a way that might be exasperated or sarcastic, especially given the unexpected nature of mentioning a pie eating contest.

while the text is brief, the combination of these elements strongly suggests that dorothy's response is meant to be sarcastic, likely poking fun at rose's misunderstanding or naivety about a situation involving a pie eating contest.",1.0

 ROSE: Are you upset because Blanche is going to sell the house and we can't live together.
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the available cues and the content of the input text, i would assign the label:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is absurd and unlikely to be sincere, as joe piscopo was not a serious contender for the lead role in ""rain man.""
2. the movie ""rain man"" was a critically acclaimed drama starring dustin hoffman and tom cruise. joe piscopo, known primarily for comedy, would have been an extremely odd choice for the lead role.
3. the incongruity between the serious tone of being ""upset"" and the absurd idea of joe piscopo in ""rain man"" suggests sarcasm.
4. this type of statement is often used in comedic contexts to make a joke about misplaced priorities or ridiculous complaints.

while sarcasm can be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the absurdity of the statement strongly suggests it is not meant to be taken literally, thus indicating sarcasm.",1.0
DOROTHY: A bucket of chicked. I hope you like it extra flat and crispy,"ROSE: We brought dinner.
 SOPHIA: What you get?
",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i believe this statement is sarcastic. here's why:

1. emotional contrast: there's a subtle contrast between the positive act of bringing food and the negative implication of its quality (""extra flat and crispy"" suggesting overcooked or poor condition).

2. humor and irony: the phrase ""extra flat and crispy"" is an unusual and likely humorous way to describe chicken, suggesting irony. typically, these wouldn't be desirable qualities for chicken.

3. language style: the informal, conversational tone and possible intentional misspelling (""chicked"") suggest a playful or humorous intent.

4. rhetorical device: the use of irony in describing the chicken's condition points towards sarcasm.

5. context: the unusual description of the chicken as ""extra flat"" in a casual conversation about food implies a joke or sarcastic comment rather than a sincere description.

the combination of these elements, particularly the ironic description of the chicken's condition, strongly suggests that dorothy is being sarcastic about the quality of the chicken she's offering, likely for humorous effect.",1.0

",GOLDENGIRLS,1,"based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i would assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement expresses a genuine concern (""i'm worried"") without any obvious irony or mocking tone.
2. while the subject matter is unusual (michael jackson buying the elephant man's remains), it refers to a real-life rumor and doesn't appear to be exaggerated for sarcastic effect.
3. the language is straightforward and doesn't contain typical markers of sarcasm like exaggeration, rhetorical devices, or contrasting emotions.
4. the informal, conversational tone suggests a sincere expression rather than a sarcastic comment.

while the topic is certainly unusual, which could potentially be grounds for a sarcastic statement, the direct expression of worry and the lack of typical sarcastic cues suggest this is likely a genuine, non-sarcastic statement within its context.",0.0

4. the language style is described as informal and conversational, which doesn't necessarily imply sarcasm.
5. there are no emotional words or rhetorical devices that might suggest a sarcastic tone.
6. without additional context or tone indicators, this statement appears to be a literal reference to someone's cappuccino maker.

3. the language style is described as informal and conversational, which is consistent with a non-sarcastic dialogue.
4. no emotional contrasts or strong emotional words are detected, which are often present in sarcastic statements.

label: sarcastic

the context strongly suggests that dorothy's response is sarcastic. the phrase ""in what blanche, dog years?"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, implying that blanche has made an unrealistic claim about age or time. dorothy is using the concept of ""dog years"" (where dogs age faster than humans) to humorously and sarcastically question the plausibility of blanche's statement. this kind of witty, biting response is characteristic of sarcasm, especially in the context of a dialogue in a play or tv show.",1.0

however, given that we're being asked to categorize it, and considering the limited options, i'll make an educated guess:

label: not sarcastic

2. there's no obvious irony or exaggeration in the phrasing.
3. without more context or tone indicators, it's safer to assume the statement is meant literally.

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text ""member-girl: nooo"" appears to be a straightforward expression of disappointment or dismay. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm in this brief message. the elongated ""nooo"" is a common way to express genuine negative emotions in text communication, rather than a sarcastic remark. without additional context that might suggest irony or contradiction, it's most likely a sincere exclamation.",0.0

",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"based on the given information and context, i would assign the following label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
the moderator's statement ""i am sure we are all really really looking forward to hear your story"" contains exaggerated enthusiasm, indicated by the repetition of ""really."" this overemphasis often signals sarcasm, implying that the audience may not actually be as excited as the moderator claims. the tone suggests a possible insincerity or mock excitement, which is characteristic of sarcastic statements.",1.0

the moderator's comment ""sarcasm? noo."" is clearly using sarcasm itself. the elongated ""noo"" with the period at the end suggests a deadpan or exaggerated tone that actually means the opposite - implying that sarcasm was indeed present or being discussed. this fits the classic pattern of saying one thing while meaning another, which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.",1.0

the input text is clearly sarcastic. here's why:

1. the moderator's tone is exaggerated and negative, which is a common trait of sarcasm.

2. the phrase ""i just give up every tuesday of my life"" implies a sense of sacrifice that's likely overstated for dramatic effect.

3. referring to the group members as ""screwups"" is harsh and probably not meant literally.

4. the claim that they do this ""for the good of my health"" is almost certainly not true and is meant ironically. giving up time and dealing with difficult people is typically not considered beneficial to one's health.

5. the repetition of ""no, no no"" at the beginning sets a frustrated or exasperated tone, which often precedes sarcastic statements.

these elements combine to create a statement that says one thing on the surface (that the moderator is just doing their job for their own benefit) while clearly implying the opposite (that the moderator finds the task frustrating and thankless). this is a classic example of sarcasm.",1.0

while this expression could potentially be used sarcastically in some contexts, the information provided in the cues suggests that this is likely a genuine expression of surprise, disbelief, or shock. the elongated ""noooo"" followed by ""really?"" indicates an authentic reaction to unexpected news or information. the analysis of the language style, emotional contrast, and rhetorical devices all point towards a sincere, spontaneous response rather than a sarcastic one. therefore, based on the available information and cues, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0
MODERATOR: Nooo!,"SCOTT: It was quite hard .. Was just being sarcastic!
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"not sarcastic

the exclamation ""nooo!"" from the moderator appears to be a genuine expression of distress, dismay, or disappointment rather than sarcasm. the elongated ""o"" and the exclamation mark emphasize the intensity of the emotion, which is typically associated with sincere reactions. without additional context that might suggest irony or playfulness, this brief statement seems to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic emotional outburst.",0.0
MODERATOR: Sarcastic? Us? Nooo.,"SCOTT: No seriouslty.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the input text ""sarcastic? us? nooo."" is a clear example of sarcasm. the moderator is using an exaggerated tone of mock denial, which is a common sarcastic technique. the drawn-out ""nooo"" at the end further emphasizes the sarcastic nature of the statement. additionally, the cues mention that the text itself is using sarcasm to convey irony or mock denial, which aligns perfectly with this input. the presence of the word ""sarcastic"" in the emotional words extracted also supports this conclusion.",1.0

 MODERATOR: That's why we need to help each other.
 MODERATOR: I mean, you seem like a decent guy.
",SARCASMOHOLICS,1,"based on the context provided and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this statement:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the exaggerated repetition of ""really really"" suggests an overly emphatic tone that is often associated with sarcasm.
2. the claim that ""every person"" in the group wants this individual to join seems excessive and potentially insincere, which is a common sarcastic technique.
3. the role of a moderator typically involves impartiality, so such an enthusiastic endorsement from this position adds to the sarcastic undertone.
4. the context suggests this is part of a persuasion attempt, and sarcasm is sometimes used in such situations to create a humorous or ironic effect.

the combination of these factors strongly indicates that the statement is meant to be interpreted sarcastically rather than as a genuine, enthusiastic invitation.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the context provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

chandler's comment is clearly sarcastic. he's using exaggeration and absurdity (suggesting a chicken suit) to mock the justification for buying expensive boots. the sarcasm is evident in how he takes the idea of the boots going with many outfits to an ridiculous extreme, implying that the purchase was unnecessary or frivolous.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
the text exhibits several characteristics typical of sarcasm:

1. context: the line is attributed to chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor (likely from the tv show ""friends"").

2. tone: the statement has a playful, witty tone that's characteristic of sarcastic remarks.

3. unexpected punchline: the phrase ""it'll cost you one husband"" is an unexpected and exaggerated response, which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. implication: the statement implies an absurd consequence (losing a husband) for what is likely a mundane situation, which is a hallmark of sarcastic humor.

5. language style: the informal, conversational tone with a sharp, witty remark is consistent with sarcastic dialogue.

given these factors, particularly the unexpected punchline and the character's reputation for sarcasm, it's highly likely that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a literal observation.",1.0

 JOEY: I said ""a little bit"" Ross.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this dialogue is clearly sarcastic. chandler's description of his job is an exaggerated, absurd, and fictional profession that combines several unlikely elements (headhunting, soviet scientists, rogue nations) for comedic effect. the casual delivery and the incongruous greeting to rasputin at the end further emphasize the sarcastic and humorous nature of the statement. this is typical of chandler's character in the show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic and self-deprecating humor.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Let me think! Let me think! Oh, I don't care.","JOEY: The wheel or pick a Google card.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the punctuation cues show multiple exclamation points followed by a period, indicating a shift in tone.

2. the emotional contrast cue explicitly points out the quick shift from urgency to apathy, which is a common sarcastic device.

3. the content of the text itself demonstrates this shift, starting with the repeated urgent phrase ""let me think!"" and then abruptly concluding with ""oh, i don't care.""

4. knowing this is dialogue from chandler, a character from the tv show ""friends"" who is known for his sarcastic humor, further supports this interpretation.

the rapid change from apparent concern to indifference is a classic sarcastic technique, used to mock the idea of actually caring about the situation. therefore, i'm confident in labeling this as ""sarcastic.""",1.0
CHANDLER: The British are coming?,"PHOEBE: Hey you guys, guess what?
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the context of the input, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

explanation:
this line appears to be from a tv show or movie script, specifically spoken by a character named chandler. the phrase ""the british are coming?"" is a reference to paul revere's famous warning during the american revolution, but it's being used in a modern context and phrased as a question. 

given that this is likely from a comedy (as chandler is a character from the popular sitcom ""friends""), and the historical phrase is being used out of its original context, it's highly probable that this line is meant to be sarcastic or humorous. the question mark adds to this interpretation, suggesting confusion or disbelief, which is often a component of sarcastic delivery.

without more context, we can't be absolutely certain, but based on the character (chandler is known for his sarcastic humor), the unexpected use of a historical phrase, and the questioning tone, it's reasonable to conclude that this line is intended to be sarcastic rather than a literal warning about british forces approaching.",1.0

",FRIENDS,1,"based on the input text and the punctuation cues provided, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the exaggerated use of punctuation, including multiple exclamation marks and a question mark, is often associated with sarcastic tone.

2. the structure of the dialogue, with a sudden shift from enthusiasm (""oh my god i love that!"") to a stark negative (""no!""), is a classic sarcastic setup.

3. the use of ""really?"" in the middle suggests a rhetorical question, which is commonly used in sarcastic exchanges.

4. the all-caps ""no!"" at the end emphasizes the contrast with the initial enthusiasm, reinforcing the sarcastic intent.

these elements combined strongly indicate that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their actual dislike or disapproval of something, despite initially feigning excitement.",1.0

",FRIENDS,0,"based on the cues provided and the nature of the input text, i believe i can confidently assign a label:

reasoning:
1. the line appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or concern from the character chandler.
2. there's no clear indication of irony or contradictory meaning that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the exaggeration (""where are all the men?"") seems to be used for emphasis rather than sarcasm.
4. the emotional content (surprise/shock) aligns with the literal meaning of the words.
5. without additional context that might reveal a sarcastic intent, it's safer to interpret this as a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement.",0.0
"CHANDLER: This is so good, that I am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. I can enjoy my view, whilst I enjoy my desert.","CHANDLER: Mmm
 ROSS: Mmm
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the comprehensive cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text shows genuine enthusiasm and positive emotions without any hint of irony or contradiction.
2. the repetition of ""enjoy"" emphasizes sincere pleasure rather than sarcastic exaggeration.
3. the context and mood described are consistently positive, with no underlying negative sentiment.
4. the language style is straightforward and lacks typical sarcastic markers like hyperbole or unexpected contrasts.
5. chandler's statement aligns with common knowledge about enjoying desserts and views, without any subversive or mocking elements.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of chandler's anticipation and enjoyment, not a sarcastic comment.",0.0
CHANDLER: Really? Struck down in the prime of life.,"MONICA: Chandler, I think I am sick
",FRIENDS,1,"given the context and cues provided, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: sarcastic

chandler's response ""really? struck down in the prime of life."" is clearly sarcastic. the phrase ""struck down in the prime of life"" is typically used seriously to describe someone who died unexpectedly at a young age. however, chandler is likely using this dramatic phrase ironically in response to something far less serious, creating a sarcastic effect by exaggerating the situation. this mismatch between the gravity of the phrase and its probable application in the conversation is a hallmark of sarcasm, especially given chandler's character in the show friends, who is known for his sarcastic humor.",1.0
"CHANDLER: I am not freaking out, why would I be freaking out? A woman named Hildy called and said we will get married, but that happens everyday","MONICA: I am so sorry, please stop freaking out.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. the context and tone strongly indicate sarcasm:

1. chandler's denial of ""freaking out"" while simultaneously repeating the phrase suggests he is, in fact, freaking out.

2. the exaggeration that ""a woman named hildy called and said we will get married"" happens ""everyday"" is absurd and not meant to be taken literally.

3. the juxtaposition of a strange, unexpected event (a random woman calling to say they'll get married) with the claim that it's a common occurrence is a classic sarcastic technique.

4. chandler is a character from the tv show ""friends"" known for his sarcastic humor, which adds to the likelihood that this statement is meant to be sarcastic.

therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0
CHANDLER: I was making a coconut phone with a professor.,"JOEY: Where the hell have you been?
",FRIENDS,1,"not sarcastic

while chandler is known for his sarcastic humor in the tv show ""friends,"" this particular statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the line ""i was making a coconut phone with a professor"" is likely meant to be humorous or quirky, but it doesn't contain the typical markers of sarcasm such as irony, exaggeration, or saying the opposite of what is meant.

the statement is unusual and potentially comical, but it's presented as a straightforward description of an activity. it's more likely that this line is meant to be taken literally within the context of the show, possibly as part of an odd or amusing situation chandler found himself in, rather than as a sarcastic comment.

without more context, it's best to interpret this statement as a non-sarcastic, albeit unusual, description of chandler's recent activity.",0.0

 RACHEL: No, it won't be her real birthday.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the analysis of the language style provided in the cues, combined with the content of chandler's line, strongly indicates sarcasm. the use of ""gee"" as an interjection, the hypothetical structure, and the absurd suggestion all point to a sarcastic statement. this is typical of chandler's character from the tv show ""friends,"" who is known for his sarcastic humor.",1.0
"CHANDLER: Oh sure, she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening.","MONICA: Hey
 CHANDLER: Hey, where's the birthday girl?
 RACHEL: Oh she is still napping.
",FRIENDS,1,"sarcastic

i'm confident in assigning the label ""sarcastic"" to this input. the statement by chandler is clearly sarcastic, given the context and the way it's phrased.

the sarcasm is evident in a few ways:

1. the use of ""oh sure"" at the beginning is often a sarcastic opener.
2. the idea of someone being ""up all night excited"" about a party they already know about is inherently contradictory to the concept of a surprise party.
3. the phrasing ""the party she knows is happening"" directly undermines the idea of a surprise, which is likely the source of chandler's frustration or amusement.

this statement is using irony to point out the absurdity of the situation, where the surprise element of the party has been ruined. it's a classic example of sarcasm used to express disappointment or to make light of a failed attempt at surprise.",1.0
CHANDLER: Are you still enjoying your nap?,"ROSS: Okay?
 CHANDLER: Hi Emma, it's the year 2020.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the cues provided and the short dialogue line, i can make a judgment on the label:

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the question ""are you still enjoying your nap?"" can be interpreted as mildly sarcastic, especially if the nap has been going on longer than expected.
2. the use of ""still"" implies that the nap has been ongoing for some time, potentially longer than usual or appropriate.
3. the character chandler, especially if this is from the tv show ""friends,"" is known for his sarcastic comments and humor.
4. the tone of the question suggests a playful or slightly teasing attitude, which is often associated with sarcasm.

while the text is brief, the combination of these factors, particularly in the context of chandler's character (if it's indeed from ""friends""), leans towards a sarcastic interpretation rather than a literal inquiry about nap enjoyment.",1.0

sarcastic

chandler's exclamation ""you can't make this stuff up!"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this phrase is commonly used to express disbelief or amusement at a situation that seems too ridiculous or coincidental to be true. in this case, chandler finds it humorously ironic that someone has a caretaker named ernie who is also their older brother. the tone and phrasing strongly suggest that chandler is being sarcastic about the situation.",1.0

 ROSS: Dude. You're married to my sister.
",FRIENDS,1,"based on the current cues and the context of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""virtually licking her"" is an exaggerated and satirical way to describe giving a compliment, which is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

2. the contrast between the mild word ""nice"" and the hyperbolic phrase ""virtually licking her"" creates a humorous and sarcastic tone.

3. this kind of exaggeration and self-deprecating humor is typical of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic remarks.

4. the statement implies that simply saying ""nice"" is equivalent to excessive flattery, which is an absurd comparison typically used for sarcastic effect.

therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate for this input text.",1.0

sarcastic

the use of quotation marks around the word ""very"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm in this context. this punctuation technique is often used to convey irony or insincerity, suggesting that chandler is not actually excited about whatever is being discussed. the character chandler is also known for his sarcastic humor in popular culture, which further supports this interpretation. the brief, conversational style of the statement is consistent with a sarcastic quip delivered in casual dialogue.",1.0
