         the cues that led to this classification are:

        * emotional contrast: the text has an emotional contrast between the expected answer and the actual answer, which is 'we don't know'. the contrast between the expectation and the reality is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        * common knowledge: the text is implying that the answer should be known, but it's not, which is a common sarcastic technique.

        * topic: the topic of the text is unknown or unanswerable questions, which can be a topic that is often used in sarcastic language.

        * special symbols: there are no special symbols in the text, but the use of 'maybe' twice can be seen as a form of sarcasm.

        * emotional words: there are no strong emotional words in the text, but the tone of the text is informal and casual, which can be indicative of sarcasm.

         overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"this text is labeled as 'sarcastic'. 

         the cues that lead to this conclusion are:

        - **common knowledge:** the speaker is implying that they are unsure or uninterested in the answer, which is a common sarcastic tone.
        - **keywords:** the use of ""maybe"" twice in a row, which can come across as dismissive and unhelpful.
        - **language style:** the tone is informal and flippant, with a hint of annoyance.
        - **context:** the speaker is responding to a question, but their answer is unhelpful and dismissive, implying sarcasm.

        ### reasoning: 

        the text contains emotional contrast (the phrase ""that sentence doesn't even make sense"" is followed by a scathing critique, implying the opposite of what the initial phrase suggests), punctuation (the use of a question mark to imply incredulity), and a tone of condescension, which are all indicative of sarcasm.",1.0,"i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to this input text. here's why:

        **emotional words:** the text contains emotional words like 'doesn't even', which is a strong negation, and 'actual ideas', which implies a tone of frustration.

        **special symbols:** there are no special symbols used in the text.

        **rhetorical devices:** the text employs rhetorical devices like irony and sarcasm. the sentence 'did it occur to you...' is a rhetorical question, implying that the speaker thinks the other person is not thinking clearly.

        **topic:** the topic appears to be someone's statement or opinion, which the speaker is criticizing.

        **context:** the context is likely a disagreement or debate, where the speaker is using sarcasm to express their annoyance and frustration.

        this text is labeled as sarcastic because it contains emotional contrasts (e.g., ""proven anything"" vs. ""spew your same old drivel""), emotional words (e.g., ""drivel"", ""corrupt"", ""fallacious""), and a tone of annoyance and frustration. the text also implies a sense of cultural background, as it appears to be an argumentative response in a online discussion or debate. the topic is an argument or disagreement, which is a common context for sarcastic language. overall, the language and tone used in the text are characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. firstly, the language style is aggressive and confrontational, which is a common feature of sarcastic tone. the use of strong emotional words like 'drivel', 'corrupt', and 'fallacious' also convey a sense of disdain and mockery, which are typical of sarcastic language. the phrase'same old drivel' is also a classic example of sarcastic phrasing, implying that the speaker is tired of hearing the same arguments and finds them ridiculous. additionally, the text contains emotional contrasts, such as accusing the other person of ignoring their words and reinterpreting them, which creates a sense of irony and mockery. overall, the tone and language used in this text are strongly indicative of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the presence of certain cues that indicate sarcasm. here's a breakdown of those cues:

1. **emotional words:** words like 'drivel', 'corrupt', and 'fallacious' convey a strong negative emotion, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

2. **context:** the context of the conversation is a disagreement or argument, which often involves sarcastic remarks.

3. **common knowledge:** it's common knowledge that in an argument, people might use sarcasm to express frustration or annoyance, which is the case here.

4. **special symbols:** there are no special symbols in this text, but the tone and language used imply a sarcastic tone.

5. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed is anger or frustration, but the language used is exaggerated and mocking, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.

To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336

        2. **special symbols**: although there are no special symbols in this text, the tone and language used imply a sense of mockery and disdain, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.

        3. **language style**: the language is formal, but the tone is condescending and critical, implying that the author is being facetious. the use of phrases like ""pseudo intellectuals"" and ""you people"" adds to the sarcastic tone.

        4. **emotional words**: words like ""ignorant"", ""lies"", ""deceptions"", ""bankrupt"", and ""fiction"" convey strong negative emotions and imply a sense of ridicule.

        5. **punctuation**: the use of long sentences with multiple clauses and phrases creates a sense of sarcasm, as if the author is piling on the criticism.

         2. **language style**: the language used is aggressive, confrontational and condescending, which is typical of sarcastic tone. the use of rhetorical questions ('so who are you people to even judge...') and phrases like 'i say this only so you pseudo intellectuals...' also contribute to the sarcastic tone. 

         3. **cultural background**: the text appears to be written from a religious or creationist perspective, which may be critical of the theory of evolution. this cultural context adds to the sarcastic tone. 

         4. **punctuation**: the use of multiple sentences, some of which are long and complex, and the frequent use of commas and periods creates a sense of urgency and frustration, which is typical of sarcastic texts. 

         5. **topic**: the topic of the text is a contentious one, and the strong opinions and emotional language used contribute to the sarcastic tone. the text is not just a neutral discussion of evolution, but a passionate attack on those who believe in it.",1.0,"not sarcastic

        - language style: the language used is aggressive, confrontational, and condescending, with phrases like ""you smuggly hold in contempt"" and ""your deluded thoughts"", which are typical of sarcastic tone.
        - cultural background: the cultural background of this text appears to be western, where direct confrontation and criticism are more common, which can facilitate sarcastic expressions.

        the given input text contains cues that suggest it is sarcastic. 

        1. **surface emotion**: the tone of the text appears to be negative and dismissive, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        2. **language style**: the use of the phrase ""most aren't"" implies a sense of resignation or frustration, which can be indicative of sarcasm.

        3. **rhetorical devices**: the text employs a rhetorical device known as understatement, where the speaker downplays the likelihood of someone being willing to receive something. this can be seen as a sarcastic way of expressing skepticism.

        based on these cues, it can be inferred that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the text is classified as 'sarcastic' because it contains a subtle tone of irony and skepticism. the phrase 'but only if they're willing to receive one' sets a condition that seems reasonable, but the following sentence 'most aren't' implies that this condition is rarely met, which is a sarcastic comment on the likelihood of people being willing to receive something. the use of the word'most' also adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker has a low opinion of people's willingness. overall, the text uses irony and understatement to convey a sarcastic attitude.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the sentence structure and word choice indicate a tone of sarcasm. the phrase ""but only if"" implies a condition that is unlikely to be met, and the statement ""most aren't"" reinforces this idea. the use of ""but"" at the beginning of the sentence also creates a sense of contrast, which is a common cue for sarcasm. overall, the tone is ironic and dismissive, suggesting that the speaker does not expect people to be willing to receive something.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 
        the input text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

1. emotional words: ""nope"" (written in all capital letters) and ""ya don't"" convey a tone of annoyance or frustration.
2. context: the sentence ""got any credible scientific or sociological studies?"" is a rhetorical question, implying that the speaker knows the answer is negative. the following sentence ""nope, ya don't"" reinforces this implication, suggesting that the speaker is being facetious.
3. emotional contrast: the use of ""prove it"" at the beginning of the sentence, which sounds like a serious challenge, is contrasted with the sarcastic tone of the rest of the sentence.

        ### reasoning: 

        the given input text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. special symbols: the use of all capital letters in ""nope"" emphasizes the speaker's tone and adds a sarcastic tone to the sentence.

        2. emotional contrast: the sentence ""prove it. got any credible scientific or sociological studies?"" is a serious request, but the response ""nope, ya don't"" is dismissive and playful, creating an emotional contrast.

        3. keywords: the use of the word ""ya"" instead of ""you"" gives the sentence a casual, informal tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.

        4. context: the overall tone of the text is confrontational and mocking, implying that the speaker does not believe the other person has any credible evidence to support their claim.

        ""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' due to the following cues:

        1. **keywords**: the text contains words and phrases with a sarcastic tone, such as ""o'rly?"" (a playful, mocking way of saying ""oh really?""), ""insane"", ""retarded"", and ""idiotic"". these words convey a sense of annoyance and ridicule.

        2. **rhetorical devices**: the text employs rhetorical devices like irony (e.g., ""refuted?"" and ""o'rly?""), which are typical of sarcastic language.

        3. **special symbols**: the use of ""?"" at the end of ""refuted"" and the informal, playful abbreviation ""o'rly?"" (instead of ""oh really?"") contributes to the sarcastic tone.

        4. **language style**: the text features an informal, conversational language style, which is often used in sarcastic writing. the use of colloquial expressions, such as ""moleclues to man"", adds to the sarcastic tone.

        5. **context**: the context of the text, which is a critique of an article or argument, suggests that the author is using sarcasm to express their disagreement and frustration. the text's tone is confrontational and mocking, which is typical of sarcastic language.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the given text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the following cues:

        1. **punctuation:** the excessive use of question marks, such as ""refuted?"" and ""o'rly?"" indicates a tone of incredulity and sarcasm.

        2. **keywords:** the presence of words and phrases with negative connotations like ""insane"", ""retarded"", and ""idiotic"" suggests a strong sense of mockery and ridicule.

        4. **surface emotion:** the text expresses strong emotions like frustration, annoyance, and disdain, which are often characteristic of sarcastic language.

        5. **rhetorical devices:** the text employs rhetorical questions, irony, and hyperbole (""a billion tiny changes makes a few large ones"") to convey a sense of sarcasm and mockery. the author is not genuinely inquiring or seeking answers but rather using these devices to emphasize their point and ridicule the opposing view.",1.0,1.0

        this text is labeled as sarcastic because of the language style used. the phrase ""get over it"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm, as it implies annoyance and frustration. the text also contains emotional contrasts, where the serious topic of sin and god is followed by a dismissive and casual phrase, which adds to the sarcastic tone. the keyword ""get over it"" and the emotional word ""frustration"" also contribute to the overall sarcastic sentiment.",1.0,"not sarcastic

        the text doesn't contain any cues that would indicate sarcasm. the language is direct and serious, and the tone is instructive rather than ironic or mocking. the use of the phrase ""get over it"" might seem slightly confrontational, but in this context, it's more likely intended to convey a sense of urgency or importance rather than sarcasm. there are no cultural references or keywords that would suggest sarcasm, and the context is a statement of religious belief rather than a humorous or ironic comment. the surface emotion is one of conviction or urgency rather than mockery or irony.",0.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the label assigned is 'sarcastic' because of the presence of certain cues. the phrase ""get over it"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm, as it has a tone of annoyance and dismissiveness. the use of the phrase ""so"" also implies a sense of exasperation, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. additionally, the tone of the sentence is somewhat condescending, implying that the speaker is talking down to someone, which is another characteristic of sarcasm. the language style is informal and conversational, which is also consistent with sarcastic tone. the topic of the sentence is somewhat serious (sin and redemption), but the tone is flippant and dismissive, which adds to the sarcastic tone. there are no special symbols or punctuation marks that contribute to the sarcastic tone, but the emotional words and phrases used in the sentence (""get over it"", ""so"") are strong indicators of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ### Input:
        Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants.

         3. emotional words: words like 'pestilent', 'biting','stinging', 'feces', and 'urine' create a negative and uncomfortable tone, which is typical of sarcastic language.

         4. common knowledge: the story of noah's ark is a well-known biblical story, and the tone of the text is questioning the feasibility of the story, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        ### explanation: 

        the input text is labeled as sarcastic. here's why:

        - special symbols: the use of ""humm"" at the beginning of the sentence, which is an informal and casual way of expressing skepticism or doubt, is a cue for sarcasm.

        - surface emotion: the tone of the sentence is seemingly positive, but the context and the use of ""humm"" suggest irony and sarcasm.

        - common knowledge: the statement about violent crime and murder rates is presented as a fact, but the tone and language used imply that the speaker doesn't actually believe it.

        - language style: the sentence structure and word choice, such as the use of ""so how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct"", are typical of sarcastic language, implying the opposite of what is being said.

        - topic: the topic of gun control and crime rates is a sensitive and controversial one, and the use of sarcasm in this context is likely intended to express skepticism or criticism of the idea that more guns lead to lower crime rates.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the language style of this text is informal, with the use of ""humm"" instead of a more formal greeting, indicating a casual tone. 

        the emotional contrast is present, as the speaker seems to be expressing a sense of irony or skepticism about the studies mentioned, which is evident from the phrase ""so how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct."" 

        the emotional word used is ""credible"", which has a slightly negative connotation, implying that the speaker doubts the studies' accuracy. 

        the common knowledge cue is the mention of ""concealed carry"" and ""violent crime and murder"", which are common topics of discussion in the context of gun control.

        finally, the rhetorical device used is irony, as the speaker is implying that the studies are incorrect or flawed, which is the opposite of what the studies are trying to convey. therefore, based on these cues, the label assigned to this text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        ### Input:
        Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the ""friendlyatheist.com"" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/   But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 
        this text is labeled as sarcastic because of the following cues:
        1. punctuation: the excessive use of quotation marks (""friendlyatheist.com"") and the use of capitalization (visited the site) indicate a sense of mocking or irony.
        2. keywords: the phrase ""ya know"" is a colloquialism that can come across as condescending or patronizing.
        3. common knowledge: the text assumes that the reader should have already visited the site, which is an unrealistic expectation, and the tone is critical of the reader for not doing so.
        4. language style: the text uses a sarcastic tone, with phrases like ""oh i don't know"" and ""maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist,"" which are meant to be ironic and mocking.
        5. surface emotion: the text expresses annoyance and frustration towards the reader, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,"sarcastic

         ### explanation: 
         this text is classified as sarcastic because of the following cues:
         - the language style is informal and conversational, with the use of colloquial expressions like ""ya know"" and ""oh i don't know"".
         - the tone is condescending, with the author implying that the person they are addressing is not doing their due diligence (""if you actually...visited the site"").
         - the use of all capital letters in ""visited the site"" adds emphasis and a sense of mocking.
         - the sentence ""but then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist"" contains an emotional contrast, with the author feigning surprise or disappointment at the expectation that a creationist would behave differently.
         - the tone is also somewhat playful and tongue-in-cheek, with the author using sarcasm to make a point rather than being straightforward.
         - the topic of the text is a disagreement or debate, which is a common context for sarcastic language.
         - the use of the special symbol """" at the end of the sentence adds a touch of irony and playfulness.
         - the punctuation is also noteworthy, with the use of ellipses (...) to create a sense of trailing off or hesitation, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### cues: 

        - punctuation: the excessive use of quotation marks and exclamation points (""friendlyatheist.com"", visited the site) suggests a sarcastic tone.
        - emotional words: words like ""friendly"" and ""expecting a little too much"" convey a sense of irony and sarcasm.
        - topic: the topic of the conversation appears to be a debate between a creationist and a non-creationist, which can be a sensitive and emotional topic.
        - keywords: phrases like ""ya know"" and ""oh i don't know"" can be seen as sarcastic filler words.
        - surface emotion: the overall tone of the text appears to be condescending and annoyed, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        the text exhibits several cues indicating sarcasm. 

        1. **emotional words**: words with strong negative connotations like ""shyster"" (used twice), ""lies"", ""hypocrit"", and ""hoax"" create an emotional tone and imply a strong dislike towards al gore. 

        2. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts al gore's claims with contradictory facts, creating an emotional contrast between what is expected and what is true. 

        3. **common knowledge**: the author assumes the reader is familiar with al gore, his documentary, and the controversy surrounding it, which is a common topic of discussion. 

        4. **punctuation**: the use of exclamation marks and ellipses (...) adds to the emotional tone and creates a sense of incredulity. 

        5. **topic**: the topic itself, criticizing a well-known figure like al gore, is a common theme in sarcastic texts.

        2. topic: the topic of global warming and al gore is presented in a mocking manner, implying that the author does not believe in the severity of the issue. 

        3. context: the text is filled with irony and sarcasm, as the author presents 'evidence' that contradicts al gore's claims, and uses a condescending tone to address the reader. 

        4. special symbols: the use of 'xxx' to censor a profanity adds to the sarcastic tone. 

        5. emotional contrasts: the text contrasts al gore's claims with the author's opposing views, creating a sense of irony and sarcasm. the author's tone is confrontational and mocking, which is typical of sarcastic language.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,1.0

        Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock.

        the text contains multiple cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. **language style:** the tone of the text is condescending and patronizing, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. the author is using a superior tone to lecture the senator about gun safety. 

        2. **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""interesting tid bit"" at the beginning is an example of irony, as the author is being facetious about the interest level of the article. 

        3. **context:** the context of the article is about a senator who is anti-gun, but has a concealed gun permit, which is a contradiction. the author is highlighting this contradiction in a sarcastic manner. 

        4. **punctuation:** the use of all capital letters in ""keep your finger off the trigger"" is an emphasis on the obviousness of the statement, implying that the senator should already know this basic gun safety rule.

        ### reasoning: 

        the text exhibits several cues that suggest sarcasm:

        * common knowledge: the text assumes the reader is aware of the senator's stance on guns, which is ironic given that she herself carries a concealed gun.
        * keywords: the use of phrases like ""interesting tid bit"" and ""note"" in a somewhat patronizing tone suggests sarcasm.
        * language style: the text uses a somewhat formal tone, but the language is informal and conversational, which can be a sign of sarcasm.
        * punctuation: the use of all capital letters in the last sentence (""keep your finger off the trigger"") adds to the sarcastic tone.

        - the phrase ""all ya gotta do"" is an informal and playful way of expressing the idea, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.

        3. **rhetorical devices:** the text uses rhetorical questions (""what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be?""), exaggeration (""all utility would be lost""), and irony (""if you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable""), which are common devices used in sarcastic speech.
        4. **emotional contrasts:** the text contrasts the idea of incorporating miracles into physics with the notion of science being ""arbitrary and unreliable"", implying that the speaker thinks the former is ridiculous.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

        ### explanation:

        the text is classified as sarcastic because of the following cues:

        - emotional contrast: the text starts with a negative tone (""didn't supersport openly admit..."") but then suddenly shifts to a positive tone (""you have to admit he's more honest...""), which indicates irony and sarcasm.
        - context: the context of the text is a criticism of someone (supersport), but the tone suddenly changes to praise, which is unusual and suggests sarcasm.
        - emotional words: the word ""dishonesty"" has a negative connotation, but it's followed by a positive phrase (""you have to admit he's more honest...""), which creates an emotional contrast.
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be positive (""he's more honest...""), but the underlying emotion is likely to be negative or critical, which suggests sarcasm.
        - punctuation: the use of ""for all his dishonesty"" as a phrase to introduce the contrasting idea adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the presence of rhetorical devices such as irony and sarcasm. the use of the phrase ""you have to admit"" is ironic because it implies that the speaker is being genuine in their praise, when in fact they are being sarcastic. the comparison of someone's honesty to others in a negative light is also a common sarcastic trope. additionally, the use of words like ""dishonesty"" and ""forthcoming"" have a negative connotation, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 
        the language style used in the input text is informal and conversational, with a tone that is somewhat ironic and mocking. the rhetorical device used is irony, as the speaker is saying the opposite of what they mean, i.e., they do not think the person is honest and forthcoming. the surface emotion expressed is one of annoyance and frustration, but the emotional contrast is that the speaker is actually being sarcastic and does not mean what they say. the cultural background of the text is likely american, as the reference to ""marc or aa"" suggests a familiarity with american culture or online communities. overall, the cues point to the text being sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### reason: 

        the text contains several cues indicating sarcasm. firstly, the use of the phrase ""well sigma"" is a colloquialism that can be seen as a form of emotional contrast, implying a tone of mockery or irony. the text also contains strong emotional words such as ""painful"", ""starving to death"", and ""killing"" which are used in a hyperbolic manner to convey sarcasm. the use of rhetorical questions (""which is more painful??"") and the juxtaposition of two extreme and disturbing scenarios also suggest sarcasm. additionally, the text employs special symbols such as multiple question marks (""??"") to emphasize the sarcastic tone. the cultural background of the text, specifically the reference to a controversial topic like abortion, also suggests that the author is being sarcastic. finally, the punctuation, including the use of ellipses and multiple sentences, adds to the overall sarcastic tone of the text.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### reasoning: 

         surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text is one of outrage and frustration. the use of rhetorical questions and hyperbole (""which is more painful"") indicates a strong emotional tone. 

         punctuation: the use of multiple question marks and ellipses (...) adds to the sense of drama and exasperation. 

         keywords: the text includes words with strong negative connotations like ""painful"", ""burnt"", ""starving to death"", ""killing"", which contribute to the sarcastic tone. 

         rhetorical devices: the use of reductio ad absurdum (reducing an argument to absurdity) is a common rhetorical device used in sarcastic language. the comparison of two extreme and unpleasant scenarios is meant to highlight the absurdity of a particular argument or position. 

         common knowledge: the text appears to be responding to the idea that people prioritize the mother's feelings over the baby's in the context of abortion. the sarcastic tone is used to criticize this perceived lack of concern for the baby's well-being.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### cues: 

        1. emotional words: painful, burnt, starving, killing, feels (indicates strong emotions)
        2. special symbols:?? (indicates a tone of questioning or skepticism)
        3. emotional contrasts: comparing two extremely painful scenarios in a seemingly casual tone (indicates irony and sarcasm)
        4. topic: abortion (a sensitive and controversial topic, often associated with strong emotions)
        5. keywords: sigma (a colloquial term often used in internet communities to refer to someone who is perceived as awkward or out of touch), salene ( likely a misspelling of ""saline"", a method of abortion), prematurally (a sensitive topic), clothes hanger (a dangerous and illegal method of abortion), feels (emphasizing the emotional aspect) (indicates a strong emotional tone and a sense of irony)

        note: the use of emotional words, special symbols, emotional contrasts, and keywords all contribute to the sarcastic tone of the text. the topic of abortion is also a sensitive and controversial issue, which adds to the overall sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        the text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

2. **language style:** the tone of the sentence is informal and conversational, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

3. **keywords:** the word ""appeals"" is used in a way that is clearly hyperbolic, implying that the process will be lengthy and tedious.

4. **cultural background:** the context of the death penalty and appeals process is a sensitive topic, and the tone of the sentence is dismissive and flippant, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language in western cultures.

5. **emotional contrasts:** the sentence contrasts the seriousness of the topic (death penalty) with a flippant and exaggerated response, which is a classic hallmark of sarcasm. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up. I guess in your mind this makes sense but I don't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ",'not sarcastic',0.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the given text is labeled as sarcastic because it contains cues indicating sarcasm. 

        1. **rhetorical devices:** the text employs rhetorical questions like ""i'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though i doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now."" this kind of questioning is used to mock the opponent's stance rather than genuinely seeking an answer.

        2. **punctuation:** the use of quotation marks around the quoted text, followed by a sarcastic remark, ""it only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts,"" implies irony and sarcasm.

        3. **language style:** the tone of the text is confrontational and accusatory, with phrases like ""you're steering away from the debate,"" ""you're ignoring the debate,"" and ""you're making up your own story."" this aggressive language suggests the author is being facetious and condescending.

        4. **emotional contrasts:** the text exhibits emotional contrasts by shifting from a seemingly rational discussion to condescending and mocking remarks. this contrast highlights the sarcastic tone.

        5. **cultural background:** the text is part of a debate about biblical interpretation, which may involve strong emotions and biases. the author's sarcastic tone and condescending language are likely intended to provoke a reaction from the opponent, which is a common characteristic of online debates.

        considering these cues, the text is classified as sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the text is sarcastic because of the following cues:

        keywords: ""i guess in your mind this makes sense"", ""i don't think many christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic"" imply a tone of mockery and incredulity. 

        common knowledge: the writer is aware that the interpretation of the bible is subjective and can be influenced by personal views, which is a widely accepted notion.

        context: the writer is responding to a quote that attempts to justify a particular interpretation of the bible. the writer's response is dismissive and critical, indicating that they do not accept the justification.

        cultural background: the debate is centered around the interpretation of the bible, which is a significant cultural and religious text. the writer's tone and language suggest that they are familiar with the cultural context and are using it to critique the opposing view.",1.0,1.0

         2. **special symbols:** the use of quotation marks around certain words (""where"", ""sit"", ""always"", ""eternity"") to convey irony or skepticism.

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is classified as sarcastic. 

        - cultural background: the text assumes a certain level of scientific knowledge (the concept of the big bang) and philosophical understanding (the concept of time and eternity), which may not be familiar to all cultural backgrounds. 

        - keywords: the presence of words like ""actually"", ""maybe"" and the use of quotation marks around certain words (""where"", ""sit"", ""always"", ""eternity"") implies a tone of irony and sarcasm. 

        - context: the context of the text is a response to an unmentioned statement, which the speaker is correcting in a condescending manner, implying sarcasm. 

        - emotional contrasts: the text starts with a statement that seems to be a genuine correction, but the tone shifts to a more ironic and sarcastic tone as it progresses, creating an emotional contrast. 

        - special symbols: the use of quotation marks around certain words adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker does not take the original statement seriously.",1.0,"sarcastic

         * special symbols: the use of quotation marks around certain words (""where"", ""sit"", ""always"", ""eternity"", ""big bang"") is a way of highlighting the speaker's skepticism and disdain for the original statement.
         * surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is one of pedantry and intellectualism, but beneath this lies a sense of annoyance and frustration.
         * common knowledge: the speaker is using the concept of the ""big bang"" as a way of showing off their knowledge, but also to make a point about the limitations of language and the absurdity of the original statement.",1.0,1.0

        believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 
        the text does not contain obvious sarcastic keywords like ""oh please"" or ""wow,"" but the tone and language used suggest sarcasm. the author uses a condescending tone and complex vocabulary to belittle the opposing viewpoint, which is a common trait of sarcastic writing. the use of quotation marks around ""parasite"" and ""brilliance"" also implies sarcasm, as if the author is mocking the opposing viewpoint. additionally, the author's use of rhetorical devices like irony (comparing a fetus to a victim) and hyperbole (calling someone ""self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation"") further supports the classification of this text as sarcastic. the punctuation, particularly the use of dashes and commas, also contributes to the overall tone of sarcasm. overall, while the text does not contain obvious sarcastic cues, the language and tone suggest a sarcastic attitude.",1.0,not sarcastic,0.0,"sarcastic

        ### reason: 
        the text is classified as sarcastic because it exhibits several cues. 
        1. emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the idea of the fetus being a ""parasite"" with it being a ""victim"", which highlights the irony and sarcasm in the author's tone. 
        2. emotional words: words like ""narcissism"", ""sociopathic"", ""arrogant"", and ""self-deceiving"" convey strong negative emotions and imply a sense of moral outrage, which is characteristic of sarcastic language. 
        3. cultural background: the text references legal concepts like ""strict liability"" and uses formal language, which suggests that the author is familiar with legal and philosophical discussions, and is using this knowledge to make a pointed and sarcastic argument. 
        4. common knowledge: the text assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of pregnancy and the responsibilities that come with it, and uses this common knowledge to make a sarcastic point about the inconsistency of calling a fetus a ""parasite"" while also acknowledging its humanity. 
        5. topic: the topic of abortion is a highly emotive and controversial issue, and the author's tone and language suggest that they are being sarcastic and critical of the opposing viewpoint.",1.0,1.0

        the cues used to assign the label are: 
        1. **context**: the text starts with a seemingly genuine inquiry, but the tone changes with the phrase ""it's nice to feel special"", which is a sarcastic comment implying the person is being singled out unfairly.
        2. **special symbols**: the use of ""ps"" (post script) to add a snide remark, which is a common way to express sarcasm in written communication.
        3. **keywords**: phrases like ""it's nice to feel special"" and ""go look up a book"" have a sarcastic tone, implying annoyance or frustration.
        4. **topic**: the topic of the conversation is a claim about carl burgh, but the sarcastic comment is unrelated to the topic, which suggests the person is not interested in the topic itself, but rather in pointing out the perceived unfair treatment.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### reasoning: 

         topic: the topic of the text is about a discussion on carl burgh's fraudulent claims. 

         punctuation: the use of an exclamation mark and a winking face (ps) in the sentence ""ps i note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book! it's nice to feel special"" indicates a sarcastic tone. 

         context: the context of the text is a discussion where the author is questioning someone's claim and asking for evidence. the sarcastic comment is a reaction to the person's request for the author to look up a book. 

         emotional contrasts: the text contrasts a serious topic (fraudulent claims) with a lighthearted and playful tone (""it's nice to feel special""), which is a characteristic of sarcasm. 

         rhetorical devices: the use of irony (""it's nice to feel special"") and understatement (""ps i note"") are rhetorical devices that indicate sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

         ### explanation: 

        the text contains an excessive use of positive words like ""agree"" and ""excellent"" with an exclamation mark, which is a common way to express sarcasm. the use of exclamation marks also indicates strong emotions, which in this case, might be ironic. this is a common pattern in sarcastic language, where the speaker says the opposite of what they mean.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the use of special symbols (!) and the language style (overly enthusiastic tone) suggest that the text is sarcastic. the word ""excellent"" is a keyword that often is used in a sarcastic manner, especially when paired with an exclamation mark. the tone is too positive to be genuine, implying that the author is being facetious.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the text contains rhetorical devices like 'exclamation marks' which are often used to convey strong emotions. the words 'excellent' and 'agree' are positive emotional words, but they are used in a context where they are unlikely to be genuinely meant. the context of the text is one of sarcasm, implying that the speaker does not actually agree or think something is excellent. this is a common way to express sarcasm, using positive words to convey a negative sentiment. the surface emotion of the text is one of enthusiasm and positivity, but the true emotion behind it is likely annoyance or frustration. therefore, the label assigned is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        ### reasoning: 

        the text contains several cues indicating sarcasm. firstly, there is an emotional contrast between the speaker's seeming indifference (""it's your gig, though, so do what you want"") and their strong opinions on the issue of gay marriage. the speaker's use of hyperbole (""the ultimate backlash"") and irony (""token change"") also suggest sarcasm. additionally, the speaker's tone is condescending (""i don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more""), implying that they are not genuinely interested in continuing the conversation. the cultural background of the text, referencing the civil war and abolitionists, adds a layer of depth to the speaker's argument, but does not directly impact the classification of the text as sarcastic. the topic of gay marriage and the speaker's criticism of inaction on the issue also do not directly impact the classification. the common knowledge that the speaker is drawing upon is the history of the civil war and the abolitionist movement. the surface emotion of the text is one of frustration and annoyance, which is consistent with the classification of the text as sarcastic.",1.0,"the label for the given input text is 'sarcastic'. the cues that lead to this classification are:

1. **surface emotion**: the text exhibits a tone of frustration, disappointment, and annoyance, which are common emotions associated with sarcasm.

2. **punctuation**: the use of sarcastic phrases like ""well"", ""yeah"", and ""heck"" along with the exclamation mark (""!"") suggests a sarcastic tone.

3. **language style**: the text employs rhetorical questions (""you don't have gay marriage. you have a majority in congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash?""), irony (""token change""), and hyperbole (""the ultimate backlash"") which are characteristic of sarcastic language.

4. **cultural background**: the reference to the civil war and abolitionists suggests a cultural context where the speaker is familiar with historical struggles for social change, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

5. **emotional words**: words like ""fear"", ""backlash"", and ""ultimate"" convey a sense of frustration and disappointment, further supporting the sarcastic label.

overall, the combination of these cues strongly indicates that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 
        the text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm.

        2. cultural background: the reference to the civil war and abolitionists suggests that the author is familiar with american history and is using it to make a point in a somewhat ironic way.
        3. context: the text is a response to someone else's opinion, and the author's tone is dismissive and slightly condescending.

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ?

        ### Input:
        So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy.

        this text is classified as 'sarcastic' because of the presence of certain cues. 

        - emotional words: 'not surprised' implies a sense of annoyance or frustration, which is a common emotional tone in sarcastic language.

        - rhetorical devices: the phrase 'that's a typical response' is an example of irony, which is a rhetorical device often used in sarcasm.

        - cultural background: the phrase 'call your bluff' is an idiomatic expression commonly used in western cultures, particularly in the us, to imply someone is being dishonest or trying to deceive. the use of this phrase adds to the sarcastic tone.

        - punctuation: the use of a period after 'not surprised' creates a sense of finality, which contrasts with the tone of the rest of the sentence, adding to the sarcastic effect.

        - keywords: the word 'typical' has a condescending tone, implying that the person's response is predictable and unoriginal, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of the word 'waxy' at the end is also unusual and could be interpreted as a sarcastic comment or a non-sequitur, adding to the overall sarcastic tone of the text.",1.0,1.0

        ","sarcastic 

        the given text is labeled as 'sarcastic' due to the presence of several cues:

1. **rhetorical devices**: the text employs irony, hyperbole, and sarcasm. the author uses phrases like ""to each his own...if you got it - flaunt it"" and ""think of all the pretty, fashionable gun rigs that would spawn"" in an ironic tone, implying the opposite of what they literally mean. 

2. **emotional words**: the text contains words and phrases with strong emotions, such as ""darn"", ""posers"", ""pathetic"", and ""cowards"", which convey a sense of annoyance, frustration, or disdain. 

3. **emotional contrasts**: the text juxtaposes contrasting emotions, like the casual, almost flippant tone in the beginning (""to each his own..."") with the more serious and indignant tone towards the end (""oh, and on topic..."").

4. **cultural background**: the text references specific cultural icons, such as mike hammer, and regional characteristics, like the mention of ""kalifornia"" (california), which might be perceived as a sarcastic or ironic take on the state's cultural identity.

5. **context**: the context of the text appears to be a discussion or debate about gun rights, and the author's tone suggests they are being facetious or ironic in their argument, implying that they might not genuinely believe in the benefits they are listing.",1.0,"sarcastic

         - topic: the topic of evolution and dna is a sensitive and often debated topic, and the author's tone is playful and mocking. 

         - common knowledge: the author is using the concept of ""junk"" dna and ""transitional"" fossils, which are well-known in the scientific community, to make a sarcastic point about the limitations of scientific understanding.

        ### explanation: 

        the text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm:

1. **emotional words**: the use of the phrase ""be wary of names"" implies a sense of caution or skepticism, which can be a sign of sarcasm.

2. **language style**: the text uses a somewhat condescending tone, as seen in the phrase ""we don't know entirely what it is used for"", which implies that the speaker is more knowledgeable than others.

3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of an analogy (""just look at all the blank spaces on this post"") is a rhetorical device that can be used to make a point in a sarcastic way.

4. **context**: the text appears to be a response to a previous discussion or argument about evolution, and the speaker's tone is dismissive and critical of the opposing viewpoint.

5. **keywords**: the use of quotation marks around certain words (""junk"", ""gill slits"", ""transitional"") implies that the speaker is being facetious or ironic, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

         the cues extracted are: 

         * surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text is annoyance or frustration. 

         * cultural background: the cultural background of the text is likely american, given the reference to pork and bills. 

         * keywords: the keywords in this text are 'pork' and 'bill', which are likely related to politics. 

         * topic: the topic of the text is likely government spending or politics. 

         * emotional words: the emotional words in this text are 'no' and 'tacked', which have a negative connotation. 

         the use of the phrase 'tacked onto' implies that the speaker is unhappy about the addition of the 'pork' to the bill, and the tone is sarcastic. the speaker is likely being facetious when they say 'that's just the pork tacked onto the original bill', implying that the addition is excessive or unnecessary.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the input text contains a clear example of emotional contrast. the word ""no"" at the beginning of the sentence implies a sense of disagreement or negation, while the phrase ""that's just the pork tacked onto the original bill"" is a statement that implies a sense of annoyance or frustration. this contrast between the two emotions suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.

        additionally, the use of the word ""pork"" to describe unnecessary or wasteful additions to a bill is a common rhetorical device, implying that the speaker is being facetious or ironic.

        the language style is also informal and conversational, which is consistent with sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        the input text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm: 

        1. special symbols: the use of ""..."" (ellipsis) to indicate a trailing off or a sense of exasperation, which is a common sarcastic tone. 

        2. topic: the topic of evolution and god is a common topic for sarcastic commentary, especially when presented in a condescending manner. 

        3. punctuation: the excessive use of ellipses (...) and the tone of the sentence ""well go ahead... but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you"" implies a sense of sarcasm and annoyance. 

        4. rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions (""if you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god..."") and the phrase ""well go ahead"" implies a sense of sarcasm and mockery. 

        5. context: the context of the conversation, which appears to be a debate about evolution and god, and the condescending tone of the author suggests that the text is sarcastic. the author is using sarcasm to belittle the opposing argument and make themselves appear more knowledgeable.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

         the language style of the text is informal, with a tone of condescension and mockery. the use of phrases such as ""i lack the eloquence"" and ""if you want to try and debate"" convey a sense of superiority and sarcasm. the text also employs cultural references to science and religion, which are used to belittle the opponent's argument. the emotional words used, such as ""magical"" and ""mystical"", have a negative connotation, implying that the opponent's views are naive or uninformed. the punctuation, including the use of ellipses and parentheses, adds to the tone of sarcasm and condescension. finally, the text uses special symbols such as quotation marks to emphasize the speaker's skepticism and mocking tone. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### cues: 

        1. **context**: the text is a response to a previous statement about evolution and god. the tone of the text is condescending and corrective, indicating that the author is responding to a perceived misconception.

        2. **rhetorical devices**: the author uses irony when saying ""if you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god... well go ahead... but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you."" this statement implies that the author believes the opponent's argument is weak and can be easily defeated.

        3. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion of the text is one of annoyance and frustration, as the author is correcting what they perceive as a misconception.

        4. **keywords**: keywords that indicate sarcasm include ""go ahead"", ""easy debate victory"", and ""ineffable will of god"", which are used in an ironic or condescending tone.

        5. **emotional words**: emotional words that indicate sarcasm include ""magical"", ""mystical"", ""eloquence"", ""flaw"", ""perfect"", and ""ineffable"", which have a condescending or ironic tone.

        the combination of these cues indicates that the text is sarcastic. the author is using irony and condescension to correct what they perceive as a misconception, and the tone is one of annoyance and frustration.",1.0,1.0
"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it.

2. **context**: the context of the sentence implies that the author is criticizing the 9th circuit court for overstepping its authority, which is a common theme in political discussions.

3. **surface emotion**: the tone of the text appears to be one of frustration and annoyance, with a hint of mockery towards the court's decisions.

4. **punctuation**: the use of multiple periods (...) creates a sense of exasperation and emphasizes the author's point.

5. **cultural background**: the reference to ""sodom"" as a synonym for san francisco is a culturally specific allusion that may not be familiar to all readers, but is likely to be understood by those familiar with american political discourse.

1. **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions (""honestly jyoshu, where do you get this stuff?"") and exclamations (""this is utter bs"") convey a sense of irony and mockery.

2. **emotional contrasts**: the text shifts from a serious tone (""you may see a vast difference..."") to a more aggressive and condescending tone (""honestly jyoshu, where do you get this stuff?"", ""this is utter bs""). this contrast suggests sarcasm.

3. **cultural background**: the reference to canadian government and religious freedom implies a cultural context, but the tone and language used are critical and mocking, indicating sarcasm.

        3. keywords: the keywords 'our government' and 'rights and responsibilities' have a sense of irony and skepticism, implying that the speaker does not believe that the government is truly concerned about people's rights and responsibilities.

        4. topic: the topic is the government, which is often a subject of sarcastic comments.

        5. punctuation: the use of a colon (:) after'says' is a hint that the speaker is being sarcastic, as it implies that what the government says is not to be taken seriously.

        overall, the tone of the sentence is dripping with sarcasm, making it clear that the speaker does not believe that the government truly cares about people's rights and responsibilities.",1.0,1.0

         - **context**: the context is a discussion about scientific theories, and the author is presenting their opinion about the gaia theory. the text does not contain any obvious emotional triggers or controversial statements.

        ","sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the input text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        - **emotional contrast**: the text starts with a question that seems to be genuinely curious (""why would they be useless?""), but then shifts to a tone of annoyance and frustration (""and how is this question different in any meaningful way from the above?""). this contrast between the initial curiosity and the subsequent frustration is a common indicator of sarcasm.

        - **emotional words**: the text contains emotional words like ""useless"" which have a negative connotation, indicating that the speaker is not genuinely interested in the topic.

        - **common knowledge**: the text references common knowledge about birds and their wings, which is used to make a point in a sarcastic manner.

        - **cultural background**: the text does not rely on specific cultural knowledge, but the tone and language used are typical of online forums and discussions, where sarcasm is often used to express frustration or annoyance.

        overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 
        1. language style: the text contains rhetorical questions, which are often used in sarcastic language.

        ### explanation: 
        the input text exhibits several cues that indicate sarcasm:
        - topic: the topic is a response to a previous statement, which is not provided, but the tone suggests that the author is responding to an argument that they find flawed.
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion is one of frustration, annoyance, and incredulity, which are common emotions associated with sarcasm.
        - context: the context is a response to an argument, which implies that the author is engaging in a debate or discussion.
        - common knowledge: the author is using common knowledge about birds and anatomy (wings being forelimbs with feathers) to make a point and ridicule the opposing argument.

3. **context**: the text appears to be a response to someone who has provided links or sources that the author finds unreliable or outdated. the author's tone is critical and dismissive, implying that the person is not knowledgeable or credible.

4. **topic**: the topic of the text is a scientific theory (the big bang), but the author's focus is on criticizing the other person's sources rather than engaging in a constructive discussion about the theory itself.

         emotional words: the words ""pray tell"" have a slightly condescending tone, implying that the speaker is questioning the validity of the other person's argument.

         emotional contrasts: there is a contrast between the polite phrase ""pray tell"" and the aggressive tone of ""where are you pulling this strawman from"", which creates a sense of irony and sarcasm.

         rhetorical devices: the use of the phrase ""pray tell"" is a rhetorical device, as it's not meant to be taken literally, but rather to convey a sense of skepticism.

         surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be annoyance or frustration, but the use of irony and rhetorical devices suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        - emotional contrasts: the tone of the sentence is confrontational and slightly annoyed, which contrasts with the polite language used.
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is annoyance or frustration.

        1. rhetorical devices: the use of phrases like ""shh shhh it's ok"" and ""maybe"" with an ironic tone, which is opposite to their literal meaning, indicates sarcasm.

        2. emotional words: the words ""mellow"" and ""happiness"" are used in a way that conveys a sense of mocking or irony, which is typical of sarcastic language.

        3. language style: the tone of the text is condescending and patronizing, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. the use of phrases like ""you have managed to"" and ""you may have more in common with"" implies a sense of superiority and mocking.

        4. special symbols: the use of multiple exclamation points (""!!!"") is often associated with sarcasm, as it can convey a sense of irony or mocking.

        the input text is labeled as sarcastic because it contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

1. **emotional words**: words like ""shh shhh"" and ""mellow mellow mellow"" at the beginning of the text have a condescending tone, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. 

2. **context**: the text is responding to a previous argument or statement about gay marriage, and the tone is mocking and exaggerated. the writer is being facetious when they say that allowing gay marriage will lead to the downfall of society. 

3. **common knowledge**: it is commonly known that allowing gay marriage does not lead to the collapse of society, which makes the writer's statement absurd and sarcastic. 

4. **punctuation**: the use of ellipses (...) and exclamation points (!) adds to the sarcastic tone, implying a sense of drama and irony. 

5. **cultural background**: in many cultures, sarcasm is used to express irony or mocking, and the tone of this text is consistent with that cultural understanding.",1.0,"sarcastic

         the text contains rhetorical devices such as irony and hyperbole. the speaker says ""shh shhh it's ok"" in a condescending manner, implying the opposite. the phrase ""managed to go from legalizing gay marriage to a collapse of our legal system"" is an exaggeration, indicating sarcasm. the use of words like ""mellow"" and ""happiness"" also convey a sense of mocking. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is characteristic of sarcastic language. the cultural background of the text appears to be a discussion about gay rights, and the speaker's use of sarcasm is likely to critique the opposing viewpoint. the punctuation, with multiple periods and a question mark, adds to the playful and ironic tone.",1.0,1.0

        the phrase ""so i pray to chance every night before i go to bed"" is a rhetorical device, specifically irony, as it is an exaggeration and an unlikely scenario. the use of the phrase ""so i"" at the beginning of the sentence is also a language style cue, which is a common way to start a sarcastic sentence. additionally, the idea of praying to chance is an absurd concept, which is another cue for sarcasm. therefore, the label for this input text is ""sarcastic"".",1.0,"i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to this input text. here's why:

        * emotional words: the use of the word 'pray' in a seemingly non-religious context can be seen as ironic or mocking, indicating sarcasm.
        * language style: the phrase 'every night before i go to bed' is a common phrase associated with prayer, but the addition of 'chance' instead of a deity or higher power is an unusual and humorous twist, suggesting sarcasm.
        * keywords: the word 'chance' is an unusual keyword in this context, implying a lack of faith or seriousness.
        * rhetorical devices: the use of irony and unexpected twists in the phrase can be seen as a rhetorical device to convey sarcasm.
        * common knowledge: it is common knowledge that people typically pray to a deity or higher power, not 'chance', which adds to the sarcastic tone.

        ### Input:
        Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### reason: 

        the text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the presence of certain cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. keywords: the word 'actually' is often used sarcastically to indicate the opposite of what follows. 

        2. context: the sentence 'it makes sense only to you' is a subtle insult implying that the person's opinion is not valid. 

        3. rhetorical devices: the text uses irony when it says 'it is mostly very economical' to describe death in nature, which is not typically considered economical. 

        4. tone: the tone of the text is condescending and mocking, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic text. 

        5. common knowledge: the mention of death in nature is a common fact, but the way it is presented here is unusual and sarcastic.",1.0,"'not sarcastic' 

        ### explanation: 

        the text does not contain any emotional words, irony, or exaggeration that are typical cues of sarcasm. the language style is straightforward and objective, discussing the concept of death in nature. the text also provides a logical explanation about the role of scavengers in minimizing waste, which further supports the label 'not sarcastic'. additionally, the use of the word 'actually' at the beginning of the sentence suggests a genuine and sincere tone.",0.0,"sarcastic 

         ### explanation: 
         the input text has several cues that indicate it is sarcastic. 
         - emotional contrast: the text starts with ""actually"" which is often used to indicate irony or sarcasm. the phrase ""it makes sense only to you"" implies that the idea is absurd and only the speaker believes it, which is a sarcastic tone. 
         - emotional words: words like ""death"" and ""waste"" have negative connotations, but the tone of the text is matter-of-fact and almost casual, which is a sarcastic way of presenting a serious topic. 
         - context: the text is discussing nature and the cycle of life and death, but the tone is detached and unemotional, which is an unusual way to discuss a serious topic. 
         - common knowledge: the idea that death is a natural part of life is common knowledge, but the way it is presented in the text is overly simplistic and almost flippant, which is a sarcastic tone. 
         - rhetorical devices: the use of understatement (""it is mostly very economical"") is a rhetorical device that adds to the sarcastic tone. the phrase ""if you look at nature for just a little while"" is also a rhetorical device that implies the speaker is stating the obvious, but in a sarcastic way.",1.0,1.0

         2. **emotional words**: the word ""cute"" has a positive connotation, but its usage in this context appears to be mocking or dismissive, implying sarcasm.

         3. **punctuation**: the question ""how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" is phrased in a way that implies the speaker does not think it is relevant, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

         these cues collectively suggest that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### reasoning: 

         this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because the words ""gooey cute"" are used in a seemingly positive context, but are actually being used to express irony or mocking tone. the phrase ""how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, implying that the previous statement is not relevant or useful in the context of the conversation. the use of words like ""gooey cute"" which are not typically used in a philosophical discussion, also adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 
        this text is classified as 'sarcastic' because of the following cues:

* the use of the words ""gooey cute"" is an exaggeration and a clear indication of sarcasm.
* the phrase ""as this reads"" is a bit awkward and formal, which might suggest that the speaker is being facetious.
* the question ""how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" is a rhetorical question that implies the speaker thinks the topic is not relevant at all, which is a common sarcastic tone.
* the language style is informal and conversational, which is often used in sarcastic texts.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic and mocking the idea that the topic is relevant to the philosophy discourse.",1.0,1.0

* cultural background: the phrase ""polly want a cracker?"" is a well-known phrase associated with parrots, especially in western cultures. the twist ""did you get another cracker polly?"" suggests a playful and ironic tone, typical of sarcasm.
* punctuation: the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence implies a rhetorical question, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic language.
* topic: the topic is seemingly trivial and unrelated to any serious conversation, which might be a deliberate attempt to be humorous or ironic.
* keywords: the keywords ""another cracker"" and ""polly"" evoke a sense of familiarity and cliché, making the sentence more likely to be sarcastic.
* rhetorical devices: the use of a rhetorical question and the unexpected twist on a familiar phrase (""polly want a cracker?"") can be seen as a form of irony, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm.

based on these cues, i believe the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"after analyzing the input text, i extracted the following cues:

         - context: the sentence appears to be a question, asking if someone has received another cracker, possibly referring to a parrot (polly).
         - common knowledge: the phrase ""polly wants a cracker"" is a well-known phrase associated with parrots, which could imply that the speaker is making a humorous or ironic comment.
         - keywords: ""polly"" and ""cracker"" are keywords that evoke the common knowledge and context mentioned above.
         - punctuation: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the speaker is inquiring or making a comment in a lighthearted or playful tone.
         - emotional words: there are no strong emotional words in this sentence, but the tone is playful and possibly humorous.

         based on these cues, i assign the label: sarcastic.

        the label 'sarcastic' is assigned because the sentence is likely making a humorous comment or poking fun at the common phrase ""polly wants a cracker"" rather than being a genuine inquiry. the tone is playful and lighthearted, which is consistent with sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

         this text is sarcastic because it uses irony and emotional contrast. the phrase ""let me see if i have this right"" is a sarcastic way of saying ""you're wrong"", and the use of ""interesting"" at the end is an understatement that implies the opposite. the language style is also formal and slightly condescending, which is typical of sarcastic tone. the context of the conversation, where the speaker is pointing out the ignorance of the other person, also suggests sarcasm. additionally, the use of the phrase ""as mr. jack said"" is a way of distancing oneself from the opinion, implying that it's not a genuine praise. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

         - **context:** without more context, it's difficult to say for certain, but the tone of the sentence suggests that the speaker might be responding to a question they've been asked before or are tired of answering.

        ### explanation: 

         the label is sarcastic because of the following cues:

        1. context: the text starts with ""oh, i dunno guys..."" which is a casual and playful tone, and then it suddenly shifts to a dramatic tone with ""*sings* 'i've been redeemed, by the blood of the lamb...'"" which is an over-the-top and ironic way to express oneself.

        2. emotional words: there is a mix of emotional words such as ""saved"", ""redeemed"" which are serious and solemn, but then it's contrasted with ""barbequed lamb"" and ""yumm"" which are playful and casual.

        3. cultural background: the reference to ""the blood of the lamb"" and ""the shroud of turin"" is a clear reference to christianity, but the way it's used is ironic and playful, which is not typical of serious religious discussions.

        4. language style: the use of ""*sings*"" and the quotation marks around the song lyrics is a clear indication of sarcasm. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek.

        5. keywords: the keywords ""barbequed lamb"" and ""holy pink bunny"" are absurd and out of place in a serious religious context, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

        overall, the text uses irony, exaggeration, and absurdity to convey a sarcastic tone, making it clear that the label is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        the cues indicating sarcasm in this input text are:

        1. **common knowledge**: the phrase ""i've been redeemed, by the blood of the lamb"" is a well-known christian hymn, but it's being used in a non-religious context, which is ironic and sarcastic.

        2. **context**: the conversation seems to be about a holy pink bunny and the shroud of turin, which is an absurd and unrelated topic.

        3. **punctuation**: the use of *sings* and... (ellipsis) creates a sense of playfulness and irony, indicating sarcasm.

        4. **surface emotion**: the text starts with ""oh, i dunno guys"" which is a casual and nonchalant tone, but then shifts to an exaggerated and dramatic tone with ""i've been redeemed..."", implying sarcasm.

        5. **emotional words**: the use of words like ""yumm"" and ""holy pink bunny"" creates a tone of mockery and sarcasm.

        considering these cues, the correct label for this input text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic

         * the abrupt shift in topic from a supposedly profound moment to a mundane and unrelated topic (""ummm... barbequed lamb.... rare... yumm...."") is a common tactic used in sarcastic language.
         * the use of special symbols (""*sings*"") adds to the playful and ironic tone of the text.
         * the mention of the ""holy pink bunny"" and the ""shroud of turin"" is an absurd and humorous comparison, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life?

4. **cultural background**: the text assumes a cultural background where god is often associated with love and unknowability, which is being subverted for comedic effect.

         explanation: 

         the cues that lead to this classification are:

         1. language style: the sentence is structured in a way that is playful and ironic, which is a common feature of sarcastic language.

         2. emotional words: the word ""terrible"" is used in a way that is opposite of its literal meaning, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

         3. keywords: the word ""waist"" is used in a way that is unexpected, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

         4. special symbols: there are no special symbols used in this text.

         5. topic: the topic of feasts and waist is an unusual combination, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

         overall, the use of irony, unexpected word choices, and playful language style all contribute to the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        this text is classified as sarcastic because it contains a play on words (""waist"" instead of ""waste"") and a clever use of language to make a humorous comment about the topic of feasts. the surface emotion of the text is lighthearted and playful, and the use of wordplay is a common technique used in sarcastic language. there are no special symbols or emotional words that would indicate a different classification. the topic of feasts is also relevant to the sarcastic tone. overall, the text is meant to be humorous and ironic, which are both characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         reasoning: 
        - the use of the word ""or"" at the beginning of the sentence implies a contrasting idea, which is a common cue for sarcasm. 
        - the phrase ""a waist is a terrible thing to mind"" is an ironic statement, as it's unlikely someone would genuinely believe that having a small waist is a bad thing. 
        - the context of the sentence, being about feasts, adds to the sarcasm, as it implies that one should indulge in food and not worry about the consequences on their waistline.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation:

        the input text contains cues that suggest it is sarcastic. 

        1. emotional contrast: the phrase ""full of fear and mistrust"" is used to describe the opposite group, implying that the speaker thinks the opposite group is fearful and mistrusting, while the original group is not. this contrast is ironic and sarcastic.

        2. rhetorical device: the phrase ""or 'just in case we need to pull off another revolution'"" is a clear example of sarcasm, as it is an exaggerated and unlikely reason for wanting guns in the home.

        3. emotional words: the use of the word ""fear"" and ""mistrust"" has a strong emotional connotation, and the speaker is using it to mock the opposing group.

        4. surface emotion: the tone of the text appears to be one of disdain and mockery towards the group that wants guns in their homes.

        this text is sarcastic because it implies that the people who want guns in their homes are being hypocritical. the author is pointing out that these individuals are motivated by fear and mistrust, yet they accuse others of being fearful and mistrustful. the use of quotation marks around ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" is also a rhetorical device that suggests the author is mocking or ridiculing this argument. additionally, the tone of the sentence is one of incredulity and annoyance, which further supports the classification of sarcasm.",1.0,"the label for this input text is 'sarcastic'.

         - language style: the use of quotation marks around ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" is a way of distancing the speaker from the quoted phrase, implying irony and sarcasm.
         - context: the context of the sentence, which is a commentary on the hypocrisy of people who want to own guns, also suggests a sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        the given text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. **surface emotion**: the tone of the text is confrontational, and the language used is aggressive and dismissive, indicating a strong negative emotion. 

        2. **topic**: the topic of the text is a religious discussion, but the tone and language suggest that the author is not genuinely interested in having a respectful conversation. 

        3. **rhetorical devices**: the text uses irony and condescension, as the author defines words like ""propaganda"" and ""misinform"" in a way that is perceived as talking down to the reader. 

        4. **special symbols**: there are no special symbols in the text that would suggest sarcasm. 

        5. **cultural background**: the text references the bible, which is a significant cultural and religious text. however, the tone and language used in the text are not respectful or reverent, which is unusual in a discussion about religious texts. this deviation from the expected tone suggests sarcasm. 

        overall, the combination of these cues indicates that the text is sarcastic. the author is not genuinely interested in having a respectful conversation and is instead using condescending language and tone to belittle the reader.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the cues that lead to this classification are:

1. **emotional words:** the text contains emotional words like'sermon', 'propaganda','misinformation', 'anger', which indicate strong emotions and a confrontational tone.

2. **cultural background:** the reference to the bible (job 32: 4-10) suggests a cultural background that is religious and conservative, which might be used to justify the author's stance or to mock someone else's perspective.

3. **language style:** the language style is formal and argumentative, with a tone that is corrective and condescending. the use of definitions for words like 'propaganda','misinform', and 'context' comes across as pedantic and slightly sarcastic.

4. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the text is one of frustration and annoyance, which is typical of sarcastic language.

5. **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the formal, argumentative tone and the use of emotional words like 'anger' creates an emotional contrast that is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,1.0

         * **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical question is implied, although not explicitly stated. the sentence structure and tone imply a question, which is a characteristic of rhetorical questions often used in sarcasm.
         * **language style**: the language is informal and conversational, which is often used in sarcastic tone.
         * **surface emotion**: the surface emotion expressed is annoyance or frustration, which is a common underlying emotion in sarcastic tone.
         * **emotional words**: although there are no explicit emotional words, the tone and language used imply annoyance and frustration.

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the use of emotional contrast and rhetorical devices. the speaker claims to have never heard of the word ""euthanization"" which is an obvious exaggeration, as it is a well-known term. the addition of ""neither has the dictionary"" is also an obvious falsehood, as dictionaries do contain the word. this contrast between the speaker's supposed ignorance and the reality of the situation creates a sense of irony and sarcasm. the use of rhetorical devices such as hyperbole and irony also contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the context of the text is that the speaker is feigning ignorance about the term ""euthanization"", which is a well-known term. the use of the phrase ""never heard of it before"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it is unlikely that someone has never heard of the term before. the phrase ""and neither has the dictionary"" is also a dead giveaway, as it is a ridiculous statement implying that the dictionary is also unaware of the term. the tone of the text is playful and mocking, which is typical of sarcastic language. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

2. **punctuation:** the use of parentheses and quotation marks adds a tone of sarcasm to the text. 

3. **context:** the text is making a comparison between ""military intelligence"" and ""reasonable gun regulation"" to imply that both are contradictory terms, which is a common sarcastic technique. 

4. **cultural background:** the reference to bill ayers and carl rowen, who are well-known figures with controversial views, adds to the sarcastic tone.

        ### explanation:
        the cues that indicate sarcasm in this input text are:

        1. emotional words: ""anti-choice"", ""force"", ""re-education jails"" convey a sense of strong emotions like anger and frustration.
        2. surface emotion: the tone of the sentence is aggressive and confrontational, which suggests sarcasm.

2. **punctuation**: the excessive use of commas and the question mark at the end of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone.

3. **emotional contrasts**: the contrast between the speaker's strong belief in ""choice"" and the hypothetical scenario of being forced into ""re-education jails"" creates an ironic tone.

4. **emotional words**: words like ""force,"" ""re-education,"" and ""jails"" have strong negative connotations, implying the speaker's disapproval and sarcasm.

5. **cultural background**: the topic of abortion and the reference to ""anti-choice folk"" suggest a cultural context where the speaker is likely to be using sarcasm to express frustration and disagreement with opposing views.

        - keywords: ""oh! i get it!"" is a phrase often used to express mock understanding or surprise, implying that the speaker doesn't actually understand or agree with the concept.
        - rhetorical devices: the use of quotation marks around ""unbalanced"" is a way to distance oneself from the term and imply that it's not a genuine description.

         ### reasoning: 

         the text contains cues that indicate sarcasm:

         1. **emotional contrast**: the tone of the text is confrontational and aggressive, but the language used is also somewhat playful and mocking (e.g., ""thimble head""), which suggests a contrast between the surface emotion and the intended meaning.

         2. **topic**: the topic is a sensitive issue (crime and victim protection), which is often a breeding ground for sarcasm.

         3. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion is anger or frustration, but the use of phrases like ""show us thimble head"" suggests a layer of mockery or sarcasm beneath the surface.

         4. **emotional words**: words like ""prove"", ""awarded"", and ""shut up"" convey a strong sense of frustration and aggression, but the tone is also somewhat tongue-in-cheek.

         5. **rhetorical devices**: the use of imperative sentences (""show us..."") and the phrase ""or shut up"" is a clear example of a rhetorical device, which can be a hallmark of sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

        4. **language style:** the use of a formal, almost academic tone ('dictates') clashes with the absurdity of the statement, creating a sense of irony and sarcasm.

         the language style is critical, confrontational, and condescending. the common knowledge used is the physical laws and properties of wood. the topic is the creationist myth of noah's ark. the surface emotion is annoyance and frustration. the punctuation is frequent use of question marks and exclamation marks, indicating a tone of incredulity and mockery. the use of irony and hyperbole (""poof! goddidit!"") and the tone of the last sentence (""sure worked. first thing noah did was to get drunk."") are also indicative of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning:

        the text exhibits a sarcastic tone, which can be inferred from the following cues:

1. **surface emotion**: the author's tone is condescending and dismissive, implying that they are annoyed or frustrated with the opposing viewpoint.
2. **topic**: the topic of creationism and the feasibility of noah's ark is being discussed, which is often a contentious and emotionally charged subject.
3. **rhetorical devices**: the text employs rhetorical questions (""and so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place?""), irony (""poof! goddidit!""), and hyperbole (""the only just man in the world"") to convey sarcasm.
4. **language style**: the language is formal, but the tone is informal and conversational, with a hint of mockery. the author uses colloquial expressions like ""poof"" to emphasize their point.
5. **cultural background**: the text assumes a familiarity with biblical stories and creationist ideologies, which may be specific to certain cultural or religious backgrounds. the author's tone, however, is critical and dismissive of these beliefs, suggesting a more secular or skeptical perspective.

overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic in tone, as the author is using irony, rhetorical questions, and condescending language to express their disagreement with the opposing viewpoint.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### explanation: 

         this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it uses several cues that are indicative of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 
        the text contains a sarcastic tone due to the use of rhetorical devices such as irony and condescension. the phrase ""of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers"" is particularly indicative of sarcasm, as it implies that the person being addressed is not capable of providing a satisfactory explanation. the use of the word ""enjoy"" at the end of the text is also sarcastic, implying that the task is tedious and unpleasant. additionally, the context of the text suggests that the speaker is being facetious and does not actually expect the person to provide the requested information. overall, the text exhibits a tone of mockery and annoyance, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

        * the use of the phrase ""of course"" is a rhetorical device that implies the opposite of what it says, i.e., the speaker does not actually expect the person to detail how they arrived at the numbers.
        * the sentence ""enjoy"" is a sarcastic comment, implying that the task is tedious and unpleasant.
        * the tone of the text is condescending and patronizing, which is a common feature of sarcastic language.
        * the language style is formal, but the tone is informal and mocking, which is another characteristic of sarcasm.
        * there are no obvious surface emotions expressed in the text, but the tone and language suggest annoyance or frustration.

        overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is classified as sarcastic because of the presence of certain cues. 

        1. **emotional words:** the word 'enjoy' is used sarcastically, implying that the task is tedious and unpleasant, which is a clear indication of sarcasm.

        2. **rhetorical devices:** the phrase 'of course you will have to' is used to convey a sense of obligation, which is a subtle form of sarcasm.

        3. **tone:** the overall tone of the text is condescending, implying that the task is simple and straightforward, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        4. **punctuation:** the use of a period at the end of the sentence, followed by 'enjoy' creates a sense of separation and emphasis, which further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

        these cues collectively contribute to the classification of the text as sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is labeled as sarcastic because of the presence of rhetorical devices like hyperbole (""oh my stars and garters"") and irony (the use of quotation marks around ""the real issue"" to imply that the issue is not actually being addressed). the tone is also informal and playful, which is often characteristic of sarcastic language. the context of the sentence, implying that someone has finally admitted to something, also adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### reasoning: 

        the label assigned is sarcastic. the cues that led to this conclusion are:

1. **punctuation**: the excessive use of exclamation marks and quotation marks indicates a sense of irony and sarcasm.

2. **emotional words**: the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"" is an old-fashioned expression used to convey shock or surprise, but in this context, it's likely being used in a sarcastic tone.

3. **context**: the sentence structure and wording suggest that the speaker is being facetious, implying that the person's admission is not surprising or remarkable at all.

4. **cultural background**: the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"" is a somewhat archaic expression, which adds to the sarcastic tone, as it's not a common phrase used in everyday conversation.

5. **rhetorical devices**: the quotation marks around ""the real issue"" imply that the speaker is being facetious and doesn't actually believe that the person has admitted to the real issue.",1.0,"'sarcastic' 

        ### explanation: 
        the text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the following cues: 
        - emotional contrasts: the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"" is an exaggeration and irony, indicating a contrast between the speaker's actual emotions and the situation. 
        - punctuation: the use of quotation marks around ""the real issue"" implies sarcasm. 
        - rhetorical devices: the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"" is an example of hyperbole, which is a rhetorical device often used in sarcasm. 
        - emotional words: the tone of the text is mocking and incredulous, which are typical emotions associated with sarcasm.

They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this ""power,"" too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble ""stomaching"" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc. I love helping you reach new lows.

        2. **punctuation**: the use of ellipsis (...) and rhetorical questions (""...right?"") adds to the sarcastic tone.

        3. **topic**: the topic of restricting human rights to a specific group (white folks) is a sensitive and absurd topic, which is often used in sarcastic comments to highlight the ridiculousness of a particular argument.

        4. **rhetorical devices**: the use of irony (""white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife...right?""), hyperbole (""only white folks again""), and reductio ad absurdum (taking an argument to its logical and absurd conclusion) are all rhetorical devices commonly used in sarcastic language.

        5. **cultural background**: the reference to the historical and ongoing struggles of non-white people for equal rights and the use of irony to highlight the absurdity of restricting rights to a specific group are culturally specific cues that suggest sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ### reasoning: 

        the given text has several cues indicating sarcasm:

        1. **emotional words:** the use of ""not a good option"" is a clear indication of the author's disapproval and frustration, which is a common emotional tone in sarcastic language.

        2. **emotional contrasts:** the phrase ""not a good option"" has a negative connotation, but the preceding sentence is phrased as a question, which is a subtle way of expressing irony and sarcasm.

        3. **language style:** the use of rhetorical questions (""as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training?"") is a common technique used in sarcastic language to convey irony and criticism.

        4. **common knowledge:** the author's statement about the lack of background checks and gun safety training is an exaggeration and an obvious hyperbole, which is often used in sarcastic language to emphasize a point.

        5. **punctuation:** the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the author is being facetious.

        ### reasoning: 

        the given text contains cues that indicate sarcasm. here's a breakdown of the cues:

1. **emotional contrast**: the text starts with a seemingly innocent question (""as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training?""), but then takes a negative tone (""not a good option""), indicating a contrast between the expected and actual emotions.

2. **special symbols**: the use of ""?"" at the end of the sentence is a subtle hint towards sarcasm.

3. **common knowledge**: the topic of gun safety is a sensitive issue, and the idea of anyone being able to purchase a firearm without background checks or training is unreasonable. this common knowledge is used to highlight the absurdity of the initial question.

4. **topic**: the topic of gun safety is a serious one, but the tone of the question is casual and almost flippant, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.

5. **keywords**: the phrase ""not a good option"" is a clear indicator of the author's true opinion, which is opposite of what the initial question suggests.

the presence of these cues, especially the emotional contrast and special symbols, strongly suggest that the text is sarcastic. the author's apology for ""failed sarcasm"" also reinforces this conclusion.",1.0,"sarcastic

        punctuation: the use of quotation marks around ""tim"" and excessive use of capitalization (e.g., ""r*e*a*d"") convey a sense of irony and annoyance. 

        surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is anger and frustration.

        this text is classified as sarcastic because of several cues. firstly, the phrase ""you know why"" is a clear indication of sarcasm. it implies that the reader is aware of the reason, but the speaker is being facetious. the use of the phrase ""i'm afraid"" is also a dead giveaway of sarcasm, as it is often used in a tongue-in-cheek manner. additionally, the tone of the text is somewhat condescending, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. there are no special symbols, cultural background, or emotional contrasts that contribute to the sarcasm in this text, but the emotional words ""afraid"" and ""typical"" have a slightly ironic tone that reinforces the sarcastic label. the punctuation, particularly the use of commas, creates a sense of hesitation or uncertainty, which can also be seen as a characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,"i will assign the label 'sarcastic' to this input text. here's my reasoning:

         topic: the topic of the input text appears to be the behavior of people in an online community, specifically their reluctance to engage in constructive discussions.

         rhetorical devices: the text uses rhetorical devices such as irony and hyperbole (""typical of the whole evolutionary community, i'm afraid"") to convey the speaker's sarcasm.

         ### explanation: 

         this text is labeled as sarcastic because it exhibits several cues of sarcasm. 

         language style: the text uses an informal tone and colloquial language, such as ""how can they?"", ""i can chose"", ""come to think of it"", and ""it would be your opinion"". this tone is often used in sarcastic texts to convey irony and mocking.

         context: the text is discussing logical laws and concepts, but the speaker is using an absurd and unrealistic scenario to question their existence. this context is ripe for sarcasm, as the speaker is poking fun at the idea that logical laws are subjective and can be dismissed at will.

         rhetorical devices: the text employs rhetorical questions (""how can they?""), exaggeration (""i can chose not do think about or believe in these laws""), and irony (""if they exist in the mind and not on their own, then i can chose not do think about or believe in these laws""). these devices are commonly used in sarcastic language to convey a tone of mocking and incredulity.

         emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the speaker's apparent frustration and incredulity with the absurdity of the scenario, creating a sense of irony and sarcasm.

         keywords: the text includes keywords that are often associated with sarcasm, such as ""stupid"", ""does not exist"", and ""come to think of it"". these keywords contribute to the overall tone of sarcasm and irony.

         overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is indeed sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 
        the text exhibits several cues that suggest sarcasm:
        1. **special symbols**: the use of quotation marks around ""hofflenosh"" implies a sense of irony or mocking.
        2. **cultural background**: the reference to laws of logic, such as demorgan's and distributivity, suggests a background in mathematics or philosophy, which may be used to mock or satirize the concept of absolute laws.
        3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of reductio ad absurdum (reducing an argument to absurdity) in the phrase ""if i think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either"" is a clear indication of sarcasm.
        4. **topic**: the topic of laws of logic and their supposed absoluteness is being mocked and ridiculed.
        5. **emotional contrasts**: the tone of the text shifts from seemingly genuine inquiry to mocking and ridiculing the concept of laws of logic, indicating a sarcastic tone.
