         ### explanation: 

         the text includes multiple cues indicating sarcasm: 
         1. the use of ""you $"" in all capital letters, which is an exaggeration and unusual emphasis, suggesting irony. 
         2. the phrase ""get paid 4 posting stuff like this!"" implies that the speaker is being facetious about the opportunity, as it sounds too good to be true. 
         3. the language style is informal and playful, with abbreviations like ""u"" and ""4"", which can be seen as mocking or tongue-in-cheek. 
         4. the use of multiple special symbols like ""@"", ""#"", ""||"", and ""http"" adds to the overall tone of the message, making it seem more like a joke than a genuine request. 
         overall, the tone and language used in the message suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the input text is labeled as sarcastic. the cues that suggest sarcasm are:

        * the use of the phrase ""more conservatives needed"" with a sense of irony and exaggeration, implying that there are already too many conservatives.
        * the tone of the message is informal and playful, which contrasts with the serious topic of politics.
        * the use of the symbol ""$"" in ""you $ can go"" is an emotional contrast, as it's an unusual way to write the word ""you"" and adds a touch of humor to the message.
        * the context of the message is an invitation to join a platform and get paid for posting, which is an unusual and possibly ironic request.

        overall, the tone and language used in the message suggest that the author is being sarcastic and ironic, rather than making a genuine request.",1.0,"the label for this text is 'sarcastic'. 

         here's why:

         - keywords: the text contains keywords like 'more conservatives needed' which may seem serious at first but the context of the sentence suggests otherwise. the phrase 'get paid 4 posting stuff like this' implies that the conservatives are needed to post certain content for a monetary gain, which is a sarcastic tone.

         - context: the context of the sentence is about posting content on a platform (#tsu) and getting paid for it. this context is often associated with spam or clickbait content, which is typically sarcastic.

         - surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be excitement or enthusiasm, but the context and keywords suggest that it's actually sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ","sarcastic

        ### cues: 

        - topic: sock joke
        - emotional words: darn (a mild expression of frustration, which could be ironic)
        - special symbols: @ (twitter handle, which could indicate an informal tone)
        - keywords: needs fixing (implying that the joke is not good, which could be sarcastic)
        - cultural background: twitter culture, where humor and irony are common.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        the label assigned to this input is 'sarcastic'. here's why:

        * emotional contrast: the tone of the sentence is casual and conversational, but the content is seemingly negative ('needs fixing'), which creates an emotional contrast.
        * keywords: the word 'darn' is often used in an ironic or sarcastic tone, which indicates sarcasm.
        * special symbols: the use of '@' symbols suggests a twitter-like conversation, which often employs sarcasm.
        * topic: the topic is a sock joke, which is a mundane and perhaps unimpressive subject, making the sarcastic tone more likely.
        * cultural background: the cultural background of this tweet is likely western, where sarcasm is a common tone in online communication.

        these cues collectively suggest that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the use of the word ""darn"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it is an overly polite and old-fashioned expression that is often used in a tongue-in-cheek manner. additionally, the phrase ""my sock joke needs fixing"" is a clear exaggeration and an absurd statement, implying that the speaker is being facetious. the use of the question mark at the end of the sentence also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it implies that the speaker is being rhetorical and doesn't actually expect a serious response. the context of the tweet, which is addressed to two specific users, also suggests that the speaker is being playful and humorous, which is consistent with a sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

         the tweet contains multiple cues indicating sarcasm. firstly, the use of ""liar"" in all capital letters suggests strong emotional contrast. the phrase ""i've never denied"" is also a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it implies the opposite of what the speaker is saying. furthermore, the mention of a specific and seemingly unrelated statistic (""532 murders in chicago in 2012"") adds to the sarcastic tone. finally, the presence of multiple twitter handles at the end of the tweet suggests that the speaker is responding to someone or something, which adds to the overall sarcastic tone of the message.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

         the presence of ""liar"" at the beginning of the sentence in all capital letters indicates strong emotions, and the use of ""@username"" suggests this is a twitter post. the context of the sentence implies that someone is being accused of lying, but the speaker's tone is sarcastic, as they are claiming they never denied something they were never accused of. this is an example of emotional contrast, where the speaker is using a strong word like ""liar"" but then downplaying it with a sarcastic comment. the use of punctuation, specifically the comma after ""liar"", also adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the label assigned is 'sarcastic' because of the following cues: 

1. **topic:** the topic seems to be a sensitive and serious issue (murders in chicago), but the tone is dismissive and ironic, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. 

2. **cultural background:** the use of the term 'liar' and the aggressive tone might be associated with a confrontational online environment, which is often present in social media platforms, especially in political discussions. 

3. **punctuation:** the excessive use of commas and the exclamation mark at the beginning ('liar,') creates a sense of drama and irony, which are common in sarcastic tone. 

4. **context:** the context is unclear, but the mention of specific users ('@rbrnetwork1', '@theoldbreed1775', etc.) suggests that this might be a response to a previous statement or accusation, which could be the target of the sarcasm. 

5. **special symbols:** the use of the '@' symbol, which is commonly used for tagging or addressing users on social media platforms, adds to the context and suggests an online discussion or argument, which often involves sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        the topic of the text is the notion that hipsters think irony is a thing of the past. 

        rhetorical devices: 
        - the text starts with a question (""who told...""), which is a rhetorical question, implying the speaker does not expect an answer.
        - the use of hashtags (#hipsters, #irony, #brooklyn) is ironic and sarcastic, as it is a common way to label topics on social media, but in this context, it is being used to mock the hipsters.

        emotional words: 
        - ""hipsters"" is a term that is often used in a derogatory manner, implying a certain level of disdain or annoyance.

        keywords: 
        - ""irony"" is a key concept in the text, as it is the topic being discussed and mocked.

        ### reasoning: 

        1. special symbols: the presence of hashtags (#) in the text, especially the ones that seem out of place like #hipsters and #brooklyn, can be indicative of sarcasm.

        2. context: the text is asking a rhetorical question, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. the question itself is also absurd, implying that the speaker is being facetious.

        3. topic: the topic of the text seems to be a criticism of hipsters, which is often a topic of satire and sarcasm.

        4. language style: the use of irony and rhetorical questions in the language suggests a sarcastic tone.

        5. cultural background: the reference to used bookstores in brooklyn, a neighborhood in new york city known for its hipster culture, adds to the sarcastic tone. the cultural context of hipster stereotypes and the speaker's criticism of them contributes to the sarcastic label.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        this tweet is classified as sarcastic. here's why:

        **context:** the context is about the hipster subculture and their supposed knowledge of irony. the author is implying that they don't actually know what irony is.

        **special symbols:** the use of hashtags (#hipsters, #irony, #brooklyn) is a common trait in sarcastic tweets, as it adds a layer of irony and humor.

        **cultural background:** the reference to hipsters, brooklyn, and used bookstores is a nod to the cultural context of the early 2010s, where hipster culture was prevalent.

        **rhetorical devices:** the use of rhetorical questions (""who told the #hipsters...?"", ""do they not carry history books...?"") is a classic indicator of sarcasm, as it implies the author already knows the answer and is being facetious.

        **emotional contrasts:** the tone of the tweet is playful and humorous, but also slightly annoyed and critical, which is a common emotional contrast found in sarcastic language.

        overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the tweet is meant to be sarcastic and humorous, rather than a genuine inquiry.",1.0,1.0

        * **keywords**: the hashtags '#pickanewsong' and '#cantstandit' imply that the speaker is tired of hearing the same song and is being facetious when expressing excitement. 
        * **topic**: the topic of the tweet is a song, which is a common subject of sarcastic remarks.
        * **cultural background**: the use of hashtags and the casual tone suggest that the speaker is from a younger generation, which is more likely to use sarcasm in online communication.

        ### reasoning: 

        the label assigned to this text is 'sarcastic'. here's why:

        * surface emotion: the surface emotion of this text appears to be neutral or slightly positive, as it talks about being a hipster and irony. however, this is a red herring, as the tone is actually sarcastic.
        * context: the context of the text suggests that the author is being facetious about being a hipster being mainstream, implying that it's not cool anymore. this context hints at sarcasm.
        * emotional words: there are no overtly emotional words in this text, but the word 'irony' has a slightly ironic tone to it, which can be a cue for sarcasm.
        * language style: the language style is casual and conversational, with a hint of playfulness, which can be a characteristic of sarcastic text.
        * special symbols: the use of hashtags '#hipster' and '#irony' adds a layer of irony to the text, reinforcing the sarcastic tone. the tone of the text is tongue-in-cheek, and the hashtags amplify this tone.

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains emotional contrast cues. the phrase ""being a hipster now is so mainstream"" is a positive statement, but the addition of ""oh, the irony"" suggests the opposite, that being a hipster is no longer unique or special. this contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. additionally, the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. **special symbols**: the use of '#hipster' and '#irony' is a common way to express irony or sarcasm on social media platforms. 

        2. **emotional words**: the word 'irony' itself implies a sense of incongruity, which is often used to convey sarcasm. 

        3. **emotional contrast**: the phrase 'being a hipster now is so mainstream' is a positive statement, but the addition of 'oh, the irony' implies that the speaker does not actually mean it, which is a negative sentiment. this contrast between positive and negative sentiments is a common characteristic of sarcasm. 

        4. **cultural background**: the concept of 'hipster' is often associated with irony and nonconformity, which adds to the sarcastic tone of the text.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 
        this text is classified as 'sarcastic' due to the presence of the keyword 'lol', which often implies sarcasm or irony. the use of hashtags #socute and #3moreweeks, which have a cheerful and optimistic tone, contrasts with the tone of the phrase 'he's going to have a sign for me at the airport', which might be an exaggeration or an unlikely scenario, adding to the sarcastic tone. the overall language style is casual and playful, which is typical of sarcastic texts. additionally, the emotional contrast between the literal meaning of the sentence and the tone conveyed by 'lol' and the hashtags suggests sarcasm.",1.0,"the assigned label is 'sarcastic'. 

         ### explanation: 

         the text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm:

         1. **emotional words:** the presence of 'lol' and '#socute' might initially suggest genuine enthusiasm, but in the context of the sentence, they seem excessive and ironic, implying sarcasm.

         2. **rhetorical devices:** the use of the phrase 'socute' with a hashtag can be seen as an example of irony, as it's an over-the-top expression of cuteness.

         3. **context:** the context of having a sign at the airport, which is a relatively unusual or over-the-top gesture, adds to the sarcastic tone.

         4. **punctuation:** the use of 'lol' at the end of the sentence can be seen as a way to convey sarcasm, as it's often used to soften the tone of a statement, but in this case, it may be used to imply the opposite of what's being said.

        3. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion expressed is excitement and enthusiasm (e.g., ""can't wait"", ""so much fun""), but the tone is actually negative.

        4. **special symbols**: the '#' symbol is often used to convey irony or sarcasm on social media.

        5. **emotional contrasts**: there is a contrast between the expected negative emotion (frustration) and the expressed positive emotion (excitement), which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

         the tweet appears to be sarcastic because of the use of the hashtag #not a school dropout, which contrasts with the description of someone who dropped out of school. the tone is informal, and the use of abbreviations and slang (e.g. ""pips"", ""tht"", ""ey"", ""spix"") contributes to the sarcastic tone. the contrast between the description of someone who dropped out of school and the hashtag that denies it is a strong indication of sarcasm. 

        ### cues: 

        * keywords: dropout, role model, sing
        * context: the context is about someone who dropped out of school and wants to sing.
        * emotional contrasts: the contrast between the description of someone who dropped out of school and the hashtag that denies it.
        * emotional words: none
        * topic: education, career, music.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reason: 

        the label is sarcastic. 

        - common knowledge: the phrase ""drop out of school"" has a negative connotation, but the text also mentions kirya as a role model, which is a positive figure. this contrast is an indication of sarcasm.

        - topic: the topic is about school dropouts and their role models. the text seems to be mocking the idea that someone who drops out of school would want to be a singer like kirya.

        - rhetorical devices: the use of hashtags, especially ""#not a school dropout"", is a clear indication of irony and sarcasm.

        - punctuation: the excessive use of ellipses (...) and the hashtag at the end of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone.

        - language style: the informal language, abbreviations (""tht"" instead of ""that"", ""ey"" instead of ""they""), and intentional misspellings (""pips"" instead of ""kids"", ""spix"" instead of ""speaks"") create a playful and mocking tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

         this text is classified as sarcastic because it contains several cues that suggest irony or mockery. 

        - special symbols: the use of '#' at the end of the sentence is a clear indication of sarcasm, as it's often used to convey irony or the opposite meaning of what's being said.

        - surface emotion: the tone of the text appears to be critical or mocking, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        - context: the text is talking about someone who dropped out of school and wants to sing, implying that they're not qualified or capable of doing so. the hashtags '#not a school dropout' is a clear contradiction to what's being said, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

        - keywords: phrases like 'tht ey wana sing too' and 'guy spix portuguese,french,english' have a condescending tone, implying that the person is trying too hard or is pretentious.

        - rhetorical devices: the use of irony and understatement in the hashtag '#not a school dropout' is a clear example of sarcasm. the writer is saying the opposite of what they mean, which is a classic trait of sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        this input text is classified as sarcastic for several reasons:

        1. **keywords:** the use of 'move over' is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it is a phrase commonly used to express irony or mocking tone.

        2. **rhetorical devices:** the comparison of keith mars to cliff huxtable, a well-known tv dad, is a hyperbole, which is a rhetorical device often used in sarcastic language.

        3. **emotional contrasts:** the tone of the text shifts from a genuine accomplishment (finishing the first season) to a mocking tone (comparing keith mars to cliff huxtable), indicating emotional contrast.

        4. **language style:** the use of hashtags (#veronicamars, #cliffhuxtable, #tv dad) and a casual tone ('move over','sheriff--er') suggests an informal, playful language style, which is often associated with sarcasm.

        5. **emotional words:** the absence of strong emotional words like 'love', 'hate', 'amazing', etc. suggests that the text is not genuinely enthusiastic or critical, but rather sarcastic.

        1. emotional contrast: the text starts with a positive sentiment (merry christmas) but the underlying tone is negative (soldiers couldn't make it home). this contrast is a common indicator of sarcasm.

        2. language style: the use of the phrase ""i love you all"" with a question mark at the end can be interpreted as insincere or mocking, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.

        3. context: the context of the message is about soldiers not being able to make it home for christmas, which is a sensitive topic. the tone of the message seems to be mocking the situation rather than genuinely expressing sympathy.

         ### reasoning: 
         the text is sarcastic because it uses the phrase ""i love you all"" which is an overly sentimental and exaggerated expression, and the use of the heart symbol (?) at the end, which is often used to express irony or sarcasm. additionally, the sentence structure and tone of the message seem to be mocking the idea of soldiers being away from home on christmas, rather than genuinely expressing gratitude or love.",1.0,"after analyzing the input text, i've identified the following cues:

        ","sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the tweet includes several cues that indicate sarcasm:

        1. **emotional word**: the question itself has a tone of skepticism and annoyance, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        2. **keyword**: the use of ""why"" in the question implies that the speaker already knows the answer and is being facetious.

        3. **language style**: the question is rhetorical, implying that the speaker doesn't expect a genuine response.

        4. **punctuation**: the use of ""?"" at the end of the sentence adds to the tone of incredulity and sarcasm.

        5. **special symbol**: the ""@"" symbol, indicating a twitter handle, may imply that the speaker is addressing someone directly, which can add to the sarcastic tone.

         the tweet seems to be asking a rhetorical question, which is a common indicator of sarcasm. the tone is also somewhat confrontational and inquiring, implying that the speaker is being facetious. the cultural background of the tweet, which appears to be a commentary on international politics, also suggests that the speaker may be using irony to make a point. furthermore, the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker does not expect a genuine answer. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the tweet is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        3. **punctuation**: the excessive use of hashtags and ellipsis (...) can be seen as a form of irony or sarcasm.

        4. **emotional words**: the words 'irony' and 'nomoney' have a negative connotation, which contrasts with the positive emotion expressed through 'thanks for...'.

        5. **emotional contrasts**: the contrast between the positive emotion ('thanks for...') and the negative words ('irony', 'nomoney') suggests that the text is sarcastic. the author is being facetious by expressing gratitude in a situation that is not ideal (having no money and working part-time).",1.0,1.0

         the text contains cues that suggest sarcasm. 

         - emotional words: ""favorite things"" can be interpreted as a positive emotion, but it's followed by an unexpected action ""make people wonder"" which can be seen as ironic. 

         - common knowledge: the action of buying bogs mud boots in a dress is unusual and may not be a common practice, which adds to the humor and potential sarcasm.

         - rhetorical devices: the phrase ""one of my favorite things"" is an exaggeration and hyperbole, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm.

         - cultural background: the cultural context of buying boots in a dress may not be common in many societies, which adds to the unexpectedness and potential sarcasm.

        ### explanation: 
        the input text contains cues that suggest it's sarcastic. 

        1. **emotional words:** there is no strong emotional word that indicates sarcasm, but the word 'favorite' is used in an unexpected context, which may suggest irony.

        2. **common knowledge:** it's common knowledge that buying mud boots in a dress is not a typical or practical combination, which adds to the humor and sarcasm.

        3. **context:** the context of the sentence implies that the speaker is being facetious about making people wonder. the use of the phrase 'one of my favorite things' is exaggerated and unlikely to be true.

        4. **punctuation:** the use of ellipsis (...) at the beginning of the sentence creates a casual and informal tone, which is often associated with sarcastic language.

        5. **rhetorical devices:** the use of irony and understatement ('completely unintentional') adds to the sarcastic tone of the sentence.

        taking these cues into account, the label assigned to the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic

         ### explanation: 

         the text exhibits several cues of sarcasm. the phrase ""there's no better way"" is a rhetorical device known as irony, implying the opposite of what it literally says. the use of multiple exclamation points and emojis (☺😊) is an emotional contrast, as it conveys excitement and positivity, but the situation described (getting wisdom teeth taken out) is typically unpleasant. the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indication of sarcasm, as it implies the opposite of what the sentence says. overall, the language style is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is typical of sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        1. emotional words: 'better', 'wisdom', 'am' do not convey a strong positive or negative sentiment, but the excessive use of exclamation marks and hashtags like '#not' suggests irony. 
        2. context: the scenario described (getting wisdom teeth taken out at 8 am) is not typically considered desirable or pleasant, which contrasts with the initial statement 'no better way to start the week'.
        3. rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole ('no better way') and irony ('#not') indicates sarcasm.
        4. punctuation: the excessive use of exclamation marks and emojis (☺😊) further reinforces the sarcastic tone.
        5. surface emotion: the surface emotion appears to be positive ('better', '😊'), but the context and other cues suggest the opposite, indicating sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 
        the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains several cues indicating sarcasm. 

        1. **punctuation:** the excessive use of exclamation marks (!!!) and hashtags (#not) suggests a tone of sarcasm. the combination of these punctuation marks is often used to convey irony or sarcasm.

        2. **emotional contrast:** the phrase ""no better way to start the week"" typically has a positive connotation, but it's followed by a scenario that's generally unpleasant (getting wisdom teeth taken out at 8 am). this contrast implies sarcasm.

        3. **keywords:** the use of the word ""not"" in the hashtag, accompanied by the emojis ☺😊, which are typically used to convey happiness or sarcasm, reinforces the idea that the statement is not meant to be taken literally.

        4. **cultural background:** the use of hashtags and emojis is common in social media platforms, where sarcasm is often employed for humor or irony.

        5. **topic:** the topic of getting wisdom teeth taken out is often associated with discomfort or pain, making it an unlikely candidate for a ""better way to start the week."" this discrepancy adds to the sarcastic tone.

        ### explanation: 

        in this input, several cues indicate that the text is sarcastic:

1. **emotional contrast**: the word ""exciting"" is often associated with positive emotions, but the context of a presentation on structurally deficient bridges is mundane and uninteresting, creating a contrast that implies sarcasm.

2. **context**: the topic of the presentation is not typically considered exciting, and the addition of ""the most exciting way to start a friday"" exaggerates the expectation, making it unlikely to be genuine.

3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of hyperbole (""the most exciting way"") is a rhetorical device often employed in sarcasm to convey irony or mocking tone.

4. **punctuation**: the presence of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates that the author intended the text to be sarcastic, making it a clear cue.

5. **common knowledge**: it is generally known that presentations on technical topics like structurally deficient bridges are not typically considered exciting, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

considering these cues, the correct label for this input is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 
        this tweet is sarcastic because of the use of the hashtag '#sarcasm' which explicitly indicates sarcasm. additionally, the phrase 'the most exciting way to start a friday' is a clear example of emotional contrast, as the topic of a presentation on structurally deficient bridges is unlikely to be exciting. the context of the tweet also suggests that the speaker is being facetious, as they are implying that a presentation on bridges is not a desirable way to start the day. the use of the hashtag '#lobbyinglife' also adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is poking fun at the monotony of their job.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        the language style of the text is informal, with the use of the hashtag #sarcasm, which explicitly indicates sarcasm. the surface emotion expressed is excitement, but it's clear that the speaker is being facetious. the context is a presentation on a dull topic, which contrasts with the enthusiastic tone. common knowledge suggests that presentations on structurally deficient bridges are not typically considered exciting. the emotional contrast between the expected boredom and the expressed excitement reinforces the sarcastic tone. overall, these cues collectively suggest that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        the presence of the special symbol '#' followed by 'not' which is a common way to indicate sarcasm on social media platforms like twitter, and the use of the word 'delightful' to describe a situation that is typically considered unpleasant, such as being attacked by a cat, are strong cues for sarcasm. the contrast between the expected negative emotion and the positive adjective 'delightful' also suggests sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        * the keyword 'delightful' is used in a way that implies the opposite, which is a common way to express sarcasm.
        * the use of 'always' is a rhetorical device to emphasize the irony.
        * the hashtag '#not' is a cultural cue that implies the opposite of what the sentence is saying.
        * the topic of waking up with a cat attacking one's hand is generally not considered delightful, which is common knowledge.
        * the overall tone of the sentence is ironic and playful, which is typical of sarcastic language.

         this tweet is sarcastic because it contains a mix of emotional contrast cues and special symbols. the use of all capital letters for ""#not"" and multiple hashtags suggests strong emotions, but the content of the tweet is actually a pedantic correction, which is a classic sign of sarcasm. the tone is also condescending, with the question ""do you know what the pledge of allegiance say's?"" implying that the recipient is ignorant. the cultural background cue is the reference to the pledge of allegiance, which is a well-known american cultural symbol, and the tweet is using it to make a point in a way that is likely to be perceived as annoying or pretentious. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the label assigned to the input text is 'sarcastic' because the text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. **context:** the text is a response to a politician (@senwarren), which implies that the author is trying to correct or mock the politician's statement.

        2. **special symbols:** the excessive use of hashtags (#) and capitalization (e.g., #not, #usa) can be seen as a way to convey a tone of annoyance or mockery.

        3. **common knowledge:** the text references the pledge of allegiance, which is a well-known phrase in american culture. the author's question (""do you know what the pledge of allegiance says?"") can be seen as condescending or sarcastic.

        4. **surface emotion:** the tone of the text appears to be critical and slightly aggressive, with a hint of annoyance. the use of rhetorical questions (""do you know..."") also adds to the sarcastic tone.

        ### reasoning: 

        the language style is formal and polite with words like 'honestly', 'goddess', and 'love', indicating genuine admiration. the cultural background of the uk does not suggest any sarcastic tone. there are no emotional contrasts, and the emotional words 'love' and 'gentle' convey a positive sentiment. the surface emotion is one of admiration and appreciation. therefore, the label is 'not sarcastic'.",0.0,"the label for the given text is 'not sarcastic'. 

         the reasons for this classification are:

         - context: the context of the tweet, including the hashtags '#love' and '#pattiknows', suggests that the speaker is a genuine fan of patti stanger.",0.0,"not sarcastic 

        ### reason: 

        the input text is a compliment to patti stanger, and it lacks any cues that would indicate sarcasm. the use of superlatives such as ""goddess"" and ""love"" convey a sense of genuine admiration. the hashtag ""#pattiknows"" also reinforces the idea that the speaker is a genuine fan of patti stanger. there is no emotional contrast or irony present in the text that would suggest sarcasm. the language style is enthusiastic and effusive, which is consistent with a genuine compliment. overall, the text is likely a sincere expression of admiration rather than a sarcastic comment.",0.0,0.0

        ### reasoning: 

         this tweet is sarcastic. the cue 'fun' is an emotional word that is used in a way that is opposite of its literal meaning, indicating sarcasm. the context of leaving in the dark, which is typically not considered enjoyable, adds to the sarcastic tone. the use of '#not' at the end of the tweet also implies that the speaker is being sarcastic. the contrast between the positive emotional word 'fun' and the negative context of leaving in the dark creates an emotional contrast that is typical of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the phrase ""leaving whilst its dark is fun"" seems to be a positive statement, but the addition of ""#not"" at the end, which is a common internet slang for ""not"", implies the opposite meaning, making the statement sarcastic. the hashtag ""#not"" serves as a cue to flip the meaning of the sentence, indicating that the speaker does not actually think leaving in the dark is fun. this is a classic example of verbal irony, a type of rhetorical device often used in sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the tweet is labeled as sarcastic. here's why:

        1. **punctuation**: the use of quotation marks around ""republican move"" and ""effectively rob the royals"" indicates irony or sarcasm. the hashtag #irony further reinforces this.

        2. **rhetorical devices**: the question ""who is being robbed?"" is a rhetorical question, implying that the real robbery is kate's excessive spending, not the royals.

        3. **emotional contrasts**: the tweet starts with a serious tone, discussing a ""republican move,"" but quickly shifts to a more playful and ironic tone, contrasting the supposed ""robbery"" with kate's lavish spending.

        4. **context**: the context of the tweet, discussing kate's spending habits, implies that the author is being facetious about the ""robbery"" of the royals.

        5. **topic**: the topic of the tweet is kate's spending habits, which is often a subject of public scrutiny and humor, making the tone more likely to be sarcastic.

        1. **emotional contrast:** the use of the phrase ""putting journalism first"" in quotes, which is typically associated with a positive sentiment, is contrasted with the negative sentiment expressed by the phrase ""cut to ads during primetime"". this contrast between the expected positive meaning and the actual negative situation implies sarcasm.

        2. **keywords:** the presence of the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly suggests that the tweet is meant to be ironic or sarcastic.

        3. **language style:** the use of quotation marks around ""putting journalism first"" is a stylistic choice that implies the speaker is being facetious.

        4. **topic:** the topic of the tweet is the questionable journalistic practices of a news channel, which is a common topic for sarcastic commentary.

        5. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion expressed in the tweet is annoyance or frustration, but the use of sarcasm implies that the actual emotion is more complex and nuanced.

        overall, the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the tweet is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

this conversation is a demonstration of a sarcasm classification classifier in action. the classifier is presented with an input text and is expected to assign a label of either 'not sarcastic' or 'sarcastic' to the text. in addition to the label, the classifier is also expected to extract various cues that support its classification decision. these cues include keywords, cultural background, common knowledge, topic, and emotional words.

in this particular example, the input text is a social media post that appears to be a defensive response to accusations of racism. the classifier correctly labels the text as 'sarcastic' and identifies the following cues to support its decision:

* keywords: the use of the hashtag ""#not"" and the word ""racist"" are indicative of sarcasm.
* cultural background: the use of hashtags is a common feature of western social media culture.
* common knowledge: the idea that concern for one's country and its people does not imply racism is a widely accepted notion.
* topic: the topic of the text is politics, which is often a breeding ground for sarcasm and irony.
* emotional words: the word ""concerned"" is an emotional word that is often used to express a sense of anxiety or worry.

        this text is sarcastic. the following cues support this label:

        1. **special symbols**: the use of exclamation marks (!!) and the hashtag (#) with ""not"" and ""thanks"" is ironic and exaggerated, implying the opposite of what is being said.

        2. **emotional contrast**: the text expresses frustration and anger with phrases like ""messing me about"" and ""not delivering"", but then uses the phrase ""i feel really great"" which is an obvious contradiction.

        ","sarcastic 

        ### cues: 
        - context: the phrase ""you feel bad for your cells"" is an unusual and exaggerated sentiment, indicating sarcasm. 
        - emotional words: ""bad"" could be considered an emotional word, but it is used in a way that is insincere. 
        - rhetorical devices: the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the message is a clear indicator of sarcasm. 
        - special symbols: the use of ""#"" hashtags, especially ""#sarcasm"", is a cue for sarcasm. 
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion is positive (appreciative, blessed), but the context and hashtags suggest that it is insincere and sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### cues: 

        * cultural background: the use of hashtags (#blessed, #appreciative, #sarcasm, #kinda) is a characteristic of social media platforms, which is a common cultural background for sarcastic language. 

        * emotional words: the words ""blessed"" and ""appreciative"" have positive emotional connotations, but the context suggests irony. 

        * emotional contrasts: the contrast between the initial statement (""you feel bad for your cells"") and the hashtags (#blessed, #appreciative) implies a sarcastic tone. 

        * special symbols: the use of ""#"" and ""kinda"" suggests an informal tone, which is often associated with sarcasm. 

        * surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be positive and appreciative, but the context and hashtags suggest a sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it employs several cues that are characteristic of sarcastic language. 

        1. **rhetorical devices:** the text uses irony and hyperbole when it says ""feel bad for your cells"" and ""they're fighting hard for you."" the speaker is being facetious by anthropomorphizing their cells and attributing human-like actions to them. 

        2. **language style:** the tone of the text is informal and casual, with a dash of playfulness, which is often associated with sarcastic language. the use of colloquial expressions like ""cause"" instead of ""because"" also adds to the casual tone. 

        3. **special symbols:** the presence of hashtags like #sarcasm and #kinda at the end of the text serves as a meta-commentary, explicitly indicating that the text is meant to be sarcastic. the use of #blessed and #appreciative, which are typically used in a genuine sense, also adds to the sarcastic tone. 

        4. **keywords:** the word ""kinda"" is often used to convey a sense of irony or understatement, which is a common feature of sarcastic language. 

        5. **context:** the context of the text, which is about being sick, is not typically associated with feelings of appreciation or gratitude. the speaker's tone, therefore, comes across as insincere and sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        * language style: the use of informal language, such as ""#shaded??"" and ""#suck"", and the excessive use of hashtags, creates a playful and casual tone that suggests sarcasm.
        * cultural background: the use of internet slang and hashtags is typical of social media culture, where sarcasm and irony are common modes of expression.
        * surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in the tweet is one of frustration and disappointment, but the tone and language used suggest that this emotion is being exaggerated for comedic effect.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### explanation: 

         the cues that led to this classification are:

         1. emotional words: the presence of strong emotional words such as ""sob!"", ""#suck"", and "":-(|"" convey a sense of frustration and disappointment.

         2. context: the context of the text is about the user's attempt to create a 3d cube, but they seem to be struggling with the task, which is evident from their use of strong emotional language.

         3. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be negative, with the user expressing frustration and disappointment.

         4. emotional contrasts: the use of hashtags like ""#shaded"" and ""#shading"" contrasts with the negative emotions expressed in the text, which suggests sarcasm.

         5. common knowledge: it is common knowledge that people often use sarcasm to express frustration or disappointment, especially in online communities. 

         considering these cues, it is likely that the text is sarcastic. the user is probably being facetious about their lack of skills in creating a 3d cube, and the strong emotional language is used to convey sarcasm rather than genuine emotions.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the tweet uses hashtags like #shaded and #shading which are common in social media to express irony and sarcasm. the use of emotional words like ""sob!"" and ""i suck"" are exaggerated and hyperbolic, indicating sarcasm. the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of social media platforms. the surface emotion expressed is one of frustration and disappointment, but the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, indicating sarcasm. the cultural background of the tweet appears to be from a western social media platform, where such language and tone are commonly used to express sarcasm. overall, the tweet is likely to be sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        the text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm. 

        * the topic of getting wisdom teeth out is often a painful and unpleasant experience, but the tone of the text is casual and nonchalant. 
        * the language style is informal, with the use of colloquial expressions like ""this time next week"" and the hashtags ""#chipmunk"" which is unrelated to the topic and seems to be ironic. 
        * the punctuation, specifically the use of emojis like 😖 and 🙊, convey a sense of mock enthusiasm or irony. 
        * the context of the text implies that the speaker is not actually excited about getting their wisdom teeth out, but is being facetious.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        this tweet is sarcastic because the use of 😖 and 🙊 emojis convey a sense of frustration and annoyance, which is opposite to the expected emotional response of someone looking forward to an event. the use of #chipmunk is also an exaggeration, implying that the speaker will resemble a chipmunk after the surgery, which is an absurd and humorous comparison. the tone of the tweet is playful and ironic, indicating sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ","sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

         the use of ""@reisawal"" suggests a casual, informal tone, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the phrase ""i swear"" is a rhetorical device used to emphasize the speaker's point, but in this context, it's likely being used ironically. the phrase ""we must be twins"" is also an exaggeration, implying a strong connection between the speaker and the person being addressed, which is an unlikely scenario. the overall language style is playful and tongue-in-cheek, indicating sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 
        the phrase ""i swear we must be twins"" is often used to convey the opposite meaning, implying that the speaker does not actually think they are twins, but rather that they share a commonality or similarity. the use of the phrase ""i swear"" is also an exaggeration, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. therefore, the label assigned is 'sarcastic'.

        context: the context is a social media platform, where the speaker is addressing someone with the handle @reisawal.

        common knowledge: the common knowledge here is that it is highly unlikely that two people are biological twins without knowing it, making the statement humorous and ironic.

        topic: the topic is the similarity between the speaker and the person they are addressing.

        emotional words: there are no strong emotional words in this statement, but the tone is playful and lighthearted.

        cultural background: the cultural background is a western-style social media platform, where this type of language is common and understood. the phrase ""i swear we must be twins"" is a common idiomatic expression in american english.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 
        the use of the phrase ""i swear"" is an exaggeration, and the idea that two people must be twins just because they share some similarities is an obvious hyperbole, which are common cues of sarcasm. the use of ""@"" symbol also implies an informal tone, which is often associated with sarcasm on social media.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        this text is sarcastic because of the presence of certain cues. 

        1. **punctuation**: the text is filled with a variety of emojis, including festive ones like 🎄, 🎅, and ❄, as well as emojis representing emergency services like 🚑, 🚒, and 🚓. the excessive use of emojis can be seen as an indicator of sarcasm.

        2. **keywords**: the phrase ""raise a glass of merry"" is an unusual way to express gratitude, and the use of ""merry"" instead of ""cheers"" or ""thanks"" may indicate sarcasm.

         the language style of the input text is informal, which is often associated with sarcasm. the topic is related to politics, which can be a breeding ground for sarcasm. the use of excessive hashtags (#) is also a cue for sarcasm. the cultural background of the text is american, and the quote is attributed to obama, but the tone of the quote itself seems ironic, implying that the author is being facetious. the phrase 'is not a gift' is an emotional cue that suggests the opposite, which is a common technique used in sarcastic language. therefore, based on these cues, the input text is classified as 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reason:

        4. **contextual knowledge**: the mention of ""scherzy"" (a nickname for actress idina menzel) and ""grizabella"" (a character from the musical cats) suggests that the speaker is familiar with the cultural context and is using it to make a humorous, ironic comment.

        overall, the language and tone used in the tweet suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

         the label assigned to this text is 'sarcastic'. here's why:

        - punctuation: the text starts with '@' which is a common way to address someone on twitter, and the use of comma after 'tell' creates a sense of hesitation or mocking tone. 

        - topic: the topic is a response to someone (david white) and seems to be related to a conversation about scherzy playing grizabella, but the tone is dismissive and mocking.

        - rhetorical devices: the phrase ""do pray tell"" is a rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm, as it's an old-fashioned way of speaking and is often used in an ironic tone.

        - surface emotion: the surface emotion of this text seems to be curiosity or inquiry, but it's actually the opposite.

        - emotional words: there are no strong emotional words in this text, but the tone is sarcastic and mocking.

        overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

         the label assigned to this text is sarcastic. 

         surface emotion: polite/inquisitive

         topic: the conversation seems to be about a musical, possibly cats, and the casting of a role.

         emotional words: 'nevermind' could be considered as a slightly annoyed tone, 'pray tell' is a polite but also slightly condescending phrase.

         common knowledge: the reference to scherzy (presumably sherzinger) and grizabella suggests that the author is familiar with the musical cats.

         cultural background: the use of '@' to address someone and the informal tone suggests a social media platform, possibly twitter. the reference to the musical cats and the casting of a role implies that the author is familiar with western pop culture.",1.0,1.0

        ### reasoning: 

        * cultural background: the cultural background of the text is academic, as it mentions a thesis.

        the combination of these cues, particularly the emotional contrast and the use of the phrase ""a year ago"", suggest that the text is sarcastic. the speaker is not genuinely disappointed, but rather frustrated and annoyed that someone else took the company a year ago, and is expressing this frustration through sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

         the input text contains several cues that suggest it's sarcastic:

        1. **special symbols**: the use of #not and #good with capital letters and hashtags suggests irony or sarcasm. the excessive use of punctuation marks like.. and (; also implies a tone of sarcasm.

        2. **surface emotion**: the text appears to express outrage or annoyance, but the tone is exaggerated, indicating sarcasm.

        3. **keywords**: phrases like ""really good"" and ""expect a call"" are used in an ironic way, implying the opposite of what they literally mean.

        4. **cultural background**: the use of hashtags and @mentions suggests a social media context, where sarcasm is more common.

        5. **common knowledge**: it's unlikely that someone would genuinely accuse someone of stealing from girls and expect a call, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

        overall, the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        the label assigned to this input text is 'sarcastic'. 

        the cues extracted are:

        1. common knowledge: the text talks about having a reputation for stealing from girls, which is a negative attribute, but the tone of the text suggests irony and sarcasm.

        2. language style: the language used is casual, with the use of hashtags (#not, #good, #reputation) and colloquial expressions ('expect a call'). this informal tone is often associated with sarcastic language.

        3. surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is anger or frustration, but the tone and language used suggest that this emotion is being used to convey sarcasm.

        4. topic: the topic of the text is the reputation of someone for stealing from girls, which is a negative topic. however, the tone and language used suggest that the author is being sarcastic about this reputation.

        5. punctuation: the use of punctuation marks such as '#' and ',' creates a sense of irony and sarcasm. the use of '..' and '(;' at the end of the sentence also suggests a sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the text is classified as sarcastic because it uses irony and negative sentiment to express a contradictory meaning. the surface emotion is negative, with words like ""stealing"" and ""#not #good"", which indicates a strong disapproval. the use of hashtags ""#not #good"" and capitalization of ""stealing from girls"" emphasizes the irony and sarcasm. the punctuation, including the ellipsis and the winking face "";)"" at the end, also suggests a playful and tongue-in-cheek tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the context of the text, addressing someone with a reputation for stealing, implies that the speaker is being facetious and does not actually think the person has a good reputation. the common knowledge that stealing is wrong and has negative connotations adds to the sarcastic tone. overall, the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        * surface emotion: the tone of the tweet appears playful and lighthearted, but the use of ""may or may not"" implies a sense of irony or hesitation.
        * context: the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the tweet is meant to be sarcastic.
        * rhetorical devices: the use of understatement (""may or may not"") and the tongue-in-cheek tone suggest irony and sarcasm.

        ### reasoning:

         the text contains the following cues that suggest sarcasm:

         1. rhetorical devices: the use of ""next..."" implies a sense of frustration and annoyance, which is a common tone in sarcastic language.

         2. surface emotion: the text expresses a sense of determination and frustration, which is often accompanied by sarcasm.

         3. common knowledge: the mention of contacting multiple authorities (bbb, fcc, and states attorney general) implies that the speaker has already taken significant steps to resolve the issue, which may be an exaggeration or an expression of frustration, typical of sarcastic tone.

         4. emotional contrasts: the use of ""#not #stopping"" suggests a strong determination, which contrasts with the tone of frustration and annoyance implied by the rest of the text, creating an emotional contrast typical of sarcasm.

         5. punctuation: the use of multiple hashtags and ellipsis (...) adds to the tone of frustration and annoyance, which is common in sarcastic language.

        - rhetorical devices: the use of ""next..."" implies a sense of sarcasm, as if the author is implying that they have done everything possible and is being facetious about what's next.
        - special symbols: the use of hashtags like ""#not"" and ""#wfaa"" can be seen as a way to add emphasis or irony to the statement, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be determination and frustration, but the tone is slightly tongue-in-cheek, which suggests sarcasm.
        - topic: the topic of the text is a complaint about a company (att) and the author's efforts to resolve the issue, which is a common topic for sarcastic commentary.

         - language style: the use of a casual tone, hashtags, and an emoji creates a playful and ironic tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

         - context: the phrase 'reunited with my pump' is an unusual and unexpected statement, which suggests that the speaker is being facetious. the use of the word 'pump' without any context also adds to the humor and irony.

         - cultural background: the use of hashtags and emojis is a common feature of social media communication, particularly among younger generations. this cultural context suggests that the speaker is using sarcasm to be humorous and relatable.

         - common knowledge: it is common knowledge that people do not usually get excited about reuniting with a pump, which adds to the absurdity and sarcasm of the statement.",1.0,1.0

        this text is sarcastic because of the presence of the hashtag #irony, which explicitly indicates irony. additionally, the phrase ""it's my last year before 18"" implies that the speaker is not a child anymore, making the idea of asking their dad for santa's gifts absurd and sarcastic. the use of the phrase ""i really don't know what to ask for"" also has a tone of mock innocence, which further supports the sarcastic tone. the language style is casual and conversational, which is typical of social media platforms where sarcasm is often used. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the label is sarcastic because of the presence of the hashtag #irony at the end of the text, which is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the text itself is a statement that may seem genuine at first, but the addition of the hashtag implies that the speaker is being facetious. the use of irony is a common rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm, and in this case, it suggests that the speaker is being tongue-in-cheek about their father still getting them gifts at the age of 18. the tone of the text is playful and lighthearted, which is also consistent with sarcastic language.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        the language style used in the text is ironic, which is a common trait of sarcastic tone. the context implies that the speaker is being facetious when they say it ""didn't suck at all"" when, in reality, it likely did. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is a clear indicator of the intended tone. the use of ""notworthit"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone. overall, the combination of language style, context, and explicit keywords strongly suggest that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the presence of the hashtags '#sarcasm' and '#notworthit' explicitly indicate sarcasm. furthermore, the phrase ""it didnt suck at all"" is a clear example of emotional contrast, where the speaker expresses a negative sentiment (it sucked) but uses a positive phrase to convey the opposite meaning. the use of the phrase ""remember that one time"" also implies irony, adding to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the input text has several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. **punctuation**: the use of... (ellipsis) at the end of the sentence implies a trailing off tone, which is often used in sarcastic language. 

        2. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""it didnt suck at all"" is an example of irony, as the speaker is saying the opposite of what they mean. 

        3. **emotional words**: although not explicitly stated, the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" and ""#notworthit"" convey a sense of frustration or annoyance. 

        4. **common knowledge**: the situation described (working two jobs while sick) is generally considered undesirable, so the speaker's claim that ""it didnt suck at all"" is unlikely to be genuine.

        5. **surface emotion**: the tone of the text appears to be negative, despite the literal words being positive, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language.

        considering these cues, the input text is correctly labeled as 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 
        the label for this text is 'sarcastic' because of the use of the phrase ""really excited"", which is often used sarcastically to express the opposite sentiment. additionally, the context and language style suggest that the speaker is being facetious, implying that they are not actually looking forward to the next semester. the use of the phrase ""next semester"" also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it implies that the speaker is already dreading the upcoming semester. the punctuation and special symbols (!) do not explicitly indicate sarcasm, but the overall language style and context contribute to the sarcastic interpretation.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the cue that indicates sarcasm here is the use of the emotional word ""excited"", which is often used to express enthusiasm or eagerness. however, the context of the sentence, ""next semester"", which is often associated with academic stress and hard work, contradicts the positive emotion expressed. this incongruity suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic, implying that they are not actually looking forward to the next semester.",1.0,"sarcastic

        - language style: the sentence structure is simple and casual, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        - punctuation: there is no punctuation that stands out, but the lack of enthusiasm in the sentence implies sarcasm.
        - rhetorical devices: there is no obvious use of rhetorical devices, but the tone is ironic, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.

3. **cultural background:** the reference to alanis morissette's song ""ironic"" is a cultural nod that many people will recognize, and the irony of the situation will not be lost on them.

4. **emotional words:** the use of the word ""suck"" has a negative connotation, implying a strong emotional response, which is often characteristic of sarcastic language.

5. **language style:** the tone of the tweet is informal, with a touch of humor and playfulness, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of the phrase ""suck more"" is also a colloquialism that adds to the sarcastic tone.

        ### reasoning: 

        this input text is classified as sarcastic because of the following cues: 

        1. emotional contrast: the sentence starts with ""i am so glad"", which expresses happiness, but the following context ""to have to the mother not show up"" reveals frustration and disappointment. 

        2. punctuation: the use of the exclamation mark (!) at the end of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone. 

        3. language style: the use of irony in the sentence, where the speaker says the opposite of what they mean, is a characteristic of sarcastic language. 

        4. emotional words: the word ""glad"" is an emotional word that is used to express a positive sentiment, but in this context, it is used in a sarcastic way. 

        5. topic: the topic of the sentence is a frustrating experience (not showing up for an office visit), which is often associated with sarcastic responses.

        the hashtag ""#not"" at the end of the sentence is also an indication of sarcasm. it implies that the speaker is being facetious and that the opposite of what they said is true.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        in this tweet, we can identify several cues that suggest sarcasm:

        1. cultural background: the use of hashtags, specifically #not, is a common internet slang used to convey irony or sarcasm.

        2. topic: the topic of the tweet is an office visit, which is typically a mundane and unexciting event. the tone of the tweet, however, is exaggerated and enthusiastic, indicating sarcasm.

        3. emotional contrasts: the tweet expresses gladness, which is an unusual emotion to associate with waking up early for an office visit. this contrast between the expected emotion (e.g., frustration) and the expressed emotion (gladness) suggests sarcasm.

        4. rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (""so glad"") and irony (""to have to the mother not show up"") are rhetorical devices often employed in sarcastic language.

        5. context: the overall tone of the tweet, including the use of the hashtag #not, implies that the speaker is being facetious and does not genuinely feel glad about the situation.

        therefore, based on these cues, the correct label for this tweet is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the presence of emotional words like 'glad' and 'not' convey a sense of irony, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the language style is casual and conversational, with a tone that is opposite of what the words literally mean. the use of the hashtag '#not' is also an indicator of sarcasm, as it implies the opposite of what is being said. furthermore, the situation described is frustrating, which adds to the sarcastic tone. the topic of the text is a relatable, everyday experience, but the tone is clearly sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        1. **keywords:** the text contains the phrase 'u do really need to', which is a phrase often used in a sarcastic tone. the use of 'u' instead of 'you' also adds to the informal tone, which is commonly used in sarcastic messages.
        
        2. **language style:** the text uses a casual, informal language style, which is often associated with sarcastic messages. the use of abbreviations like 'u' and 'lol' adds to this casual tone.
        
        3. **emotional contrasts:** the text starts with a phrase that sounds like advice, but ends with 'lol', which is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the contrast between the serious-sounding phrase and the casual 'lol' suggests that the message is meant to be humorous or ironic.
        
        4. **special symbols:** the text contains the '@' symbol, which is commonly used to address someone on social media. the use of 'lol' at the end of the message is also a special symbol that indicates sarcasm or irony.

         the tweet contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. the language style is informal and conversational, with a tone of incredulity. the surface emotion is one of skepticism and frustration. the use of hashtags like #not and #gonnahappen is ironic and contradictory to the literal meaning of the sentence, implying that the speaker does not believe that the event will not happen. the punctuation, specifically the use of the exclamation mark, adds to the sense of incredulity and sarcasm. additionally, the cultural background of the tweet, being a response to a political event, suggests that the speaker is being facetious. the use of rhetorical devices such as irony and contradiction also contribute to the overall sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning:

         the tweet contains several cues that suggest sarcasm. 

         1. emotional contrast: the tweet starts with a seemingly serious question, but the hashtags #not #gonna #happen at the end convey a tone of disbelief and skepticism, which is a common pattern in sarcastic language. 

         2. rhetorical device: the question ""so if they undo the affordable care act, and i should expect my insurance to decline 33%?"" is a rhetorical question, implying that the expected outcome is absurd. 

         3. emotional word: the use of the word ""decline"" has a negative connotation, which is contrasted with the tone of the hashtags, adding to the sarcastic tone. 

         4. punctuation: the use of the ""#"" symbol before each word in the hashtags creates a sense of irony and emphasis, which is typical of sarcastic language. 

         5. special symbol: the use of the ""@"" symbol to address someone, which is common in twitter, does not necessarily indicate sarcasm, but it does add to the informal tone of the tweet, which is consistent with the sarcastic tone.

        2. **language style**: the use of irony in the phrase ""today's gonna be a good one..."" is a typical trait of sarcastic language. the tone is opposite of what the writer is actually experiencing, implying sarcasm.

        3. **special symbols**: the use of ""#not"" at the end of the message is a clear indication of sarcasm. the writer is explicitly stating that the opposite of what they said is true.

        4. **topic**: the topic of the message is the writer's emotional state, which is a common topic for sarcastic comments.

        ### explanation: 

        the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' due to several cues.

        - emotional words: the presence of emotional words like 'crying','stress', and 'anxiety' convey a strong negative emotion.

        - cultural background: the use of hashtags like '#not' is a common way to express sarcasm in internet culture.

        - emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the negative emotions mentioned at the beginning with the phrase 'today's gonna be a good one', which is a clear example of sarcasm.

        - language style: the use of irony and understatement ('today's gonna be a good one') is a characteristic of sarcastic language style.

        ### explanation: 

         the label is 'sarcastic' because the text contains a few cues that suggest the author is being sarcastic. 

         firstly, the use of the phrase ""today's gonna be a good one"" is a rhetorical device, specifically irony, as the author has just mentioned they started crying due to lack of sleep, stress, and test anxiety, which implies that the day is not going well. 

         secondly, the context of the text, where the author mentions crying due to negative emotions, contrasts with the positive phrase ""today's gonna be a good one"", which is another cue for sarcasm. 

         thirdly, the language style is informal, with the use of hashtags and colloquial expressions, which is common in social media and online communication, where sarcasm is often used. 

         lastly, the common knowledge that people don't usually cry due to positive emotions and the cultural background of using irony and sarcasm in online communication also support the label 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation:

        the input text is sarcastic because it contains a hashtag '#sarcasm', which explicitly indicates sarcasm. additionally, the phrase ""great start to the week!"" is likely to be ironic, as it implies the opposite sentiment (a bad start to the week). the context of the tweet, where the author mentions scribbling angry/pretty things when lacking inspiration, also suggests a tone of frustration or disappointment, which is reinforced by the sarcastic remark.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the text contains several cues indicating sarcasm:

        1. **emotional words**: ""angry"" and ""great"" have opposite emotional connotations, suggesting irony.

        2. **special symbols**: the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates sarcasm.

        3. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""great start to the week!"" is an example of irony, as it contrasts with the negative sentiment expressed earlier.

        4. **surface emotion**: the tone of the text appears to be negative, but the use of ""great"" and the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" suggest that the author is being facetious.

        the text includes a hashtag #not which is an indication of sarcasm. the use of the phrase 'nuff' which is a casual and informal way of saying 'enough' and the excessive use of hashtags and urls also suggest a sarcastic tone. the language style is informal and playful, which is consistent with sarcastic language. overall, the context of the tweet and the use of rhetorical devices such as irony and hyperbole suggest that the text is sarcastic. the surface emotion of the text is annoyance or frustration, which is also consistent with sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        this tweet is classified as sarcastic because of several cues: 

1. **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""nuff"" (enough) is an informal and casual way of expressing sarcasm. it's often used to imply the opposite of what is being said.

2. **emotional words**: the presence of hashtags like ""#couldn039t"" and ""#not"" implies a tone of irony and frustration, which are common emotional indicators of sarcasm.

3. **punctuation**: the excessive use of hashtags (#) and the rt (retweet) symbol can be seen as a way to amplify the sarcastic tone.

4. **language style**: the language used is informal and conversational, with a touch of playfulness, which is typical of sarcastic tweets.

5. **cultural background**: the reference to bob ross, a well-known tv personality, in the context of tattoos, is an unexpected and humorous connection, implying sarcasm.

taking these cues into account, the tweet is classified as sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the language style is casual and uses internet slang (#, rt, http://t.co/). the punctuation is informal with excessive use of hashtags. the cultural background is likely of a young adult familiar with internet culture. the context is unclear, but the tone seems to be mocking or ironic. the surface emotion is one of annoyance or frustration. these cues suggest that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 
        the use of all caps in ""happy birthday becca"" and ""all"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it's an exaggeration of enthusiasm. additionally, the tone of the sentence ""i just looked through all of my pictures which you know is a ton"" is also sarcastic, implying that the speaker didn't actually look through all their pictures. the tone is playful and mocking, which is typical of sarcastic language.",1.0,"the label for this input is 'sarcastic'. here's why:

        * **special symbols:** the use of all caps for ""happy"" and the excessive use of punctuation (e.g. the period after ""becca"") can be seen as overly enthusiastic or even ironic.
        * **topic:** the topic is a birthday wish, which is a common and innocuous topic.
        * **rhetorical devices:** the use of hyperbole (""all of my pictures"") and irony (the over-the-top enthusiasm in the message) suggest that the message is sarcastic.

        the input text appears to be a genuine and enthusiastic birthday message. the use of all capital letters in ""happy birthday becca"" suggests excitement and sincerity. the language style is casual and friendly, which is typical of a celebratory tone. there are no special symbols or cues that would indicate sarcasm. the topic is a birthday greeting, which is a positive and celebratory occasion. overall, the context and language used in the input text suggest that it is a genuine and heartfelt message, rather than a sarcastic one.",0.0,1.0

        this text is sarcastic because of the following cues:

        - emotional words: 'look good feel good' seems to be a positive phrase, but the rest of the text contradicts it.
        - emotional contrasts: the contrast between 'look good feel good' and '#cantopeneyes' implies that the speaker is actually feeling tired and miserable, not good.
        - punctuation: the excessive use of exclamation mark and hashtags adds to the sarcastic tone.
        - cultural background: the use of hashtags like '#teamnosleep' implies that the speaker is part of a community that values staying up late, but the speaker is being ironic about it.

        ","sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it uses a sarcastic tone to express the speaker's dissatisfaction with their current situation. the cues that indicate sarcasm are:

        1. **emotional contrasts**: the text starts with a negative emotion (""that sad moment"") but quickly shifts to a more playful tone (""i wanna move back in""), which is an ironic and unexpected response to feeling sad.

        2. **common knowledge**: the speaker is likely an adult, and it's common knowledge that adults don't live with their parents anymore. the speaker's desire to ""move back in"" is an exaggeration and an unrealistic solution to their problem, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

        3. **punctuation**: the use of ""i wanna"" instead of ""i want to"" gives the text a more casual and playful tone, which contributes to the sarcastic tone.

        4. **cultural background**: the reference to ""presents under the tree"" is a cultural reference to christmas, which is a time typically associated with joy and celebration. the speaker's sadness and desire to move back in with their parents is a humorous contrast to this cultural expectation.

        5. **topic**: the topic of the text is the speaker's dissatisfaction with their current situation, but the tone is lighthearted and playful, which indicates sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

         the sentence ""i wanna move back in"" contains the keyword ""wanna"" which is an informal way of saying ""want to"", implying a casual tone. the punctuation used is a period, which doesn't convey any strong emotions. the emotional contrast in the sentence is between the sadness mentioned in the first part and the casual tone of the second part. the topic of the sentence is about presents and moving back in. the emotional words used are ""sad"" and ""wanna"" which convey a sense of longing and casualness respectively. the sentence as a whole has a sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is being facetious about wanting to move back in.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the surface emotion of the text is anger/frustration, but the tone is actually sarcastic. the phrase ""what the hell"" is an emotional word that indicates strong feelings, but the rest of the sentence is ironic and critical of shahid afridi's performance. the use of ""left alone more bouncers than played"" is a sarcastic remark, implying that afridi has failed to perform well. the hashtag ""#pakvnz"" suggests that the text is related to a cricket match between pakistan and new zealand, but it does not affect the overall sarcastic tone.

        rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (""left alone more bouncers than played"") is a clear indication of sarcasm. the author is exaggerating afridi's poor performance to emphasize their point.

        language style: the tone is informal, with the use of colloquial language (""what the hell"") and hashtags (#pakvnz), which suggests a casual, conversational tone often associated with sarcastic language.

        punctuation: the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence (""what the hell has happened to shahid afridi in last couple of days?"") adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the author is not genuinely asking a question but rather making a statement.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 
        the input text has several cues pointing towards sarcasm:
        
        * surface emotion: the phrase ""what the hell"" has a strong negative surface emotion, but the content of the sentence does not seem to warrant such strong language, indicating sarcasm.
        * emotional words: words like ""hell"" have strong emotional connotations, which are often used in sarcastic tone.
        * common knowledge: the topic is about cricket, and shahid afridi is a well-known cricketer. the sentence is poking fun at his performance, implying that he has not been doing well.
        * punctuation: the use of ""#"" and the casual tone of the sentence, including the phrase ""what the hell"", suggests a sarcastic tone.
        * topic: the topic of cricket and the criticism of a well-known player also points towards sarcasm.

1. **special symbols**: the use of exclamation marks and xx (a casual way of saying goodbye) may indicate a tone that is more playful or ironic than genuine.

2. **language style**: the phrase ""out till the death"" is an exaggeration and an unlikely scenario, which may suggest sarcasm.

3. **context**: the context of the conversation is not provided, but the tone of the message seems informal and casual, which could suggest a joking or sarcastic tone.

4. **keywords**: the word ""amazing"" is often used sarcastically to express the opposite sentiment.

5. **cultural background**: the use of casual language and abbreviations (e.g., ""u"" instead of ""you"") may be more common in certain cultural contexts, such as online social media or text messaging, where sarcasm is often used.

(a phrase typically used to express enthusiasm or support for the university of alabama) also seems out of place in a birthday message and may be meant to be ironic or sarcastic. overall, the tone of the tweet is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which suggests that it's meant to be humorous and sarcastic rather than a genuine expression of happiness.",1.0,"sarcastic

         - the hashtags '#imgettinold' and '#not' suggest a tone of self-deprecation, which is a common trait of sarcasm.
         - the hashtag '#ionlygetbetter' is a contradictory statement that adds to the sarcastic tone.
         - the phrase 'roll tide!' appears to be unrelated to the rest of the message and may be an example of non-sequitur, which is another rhetorical device often used in sarcasm.
         - the tone of the message is casual and informal, which is consistent with the tone of many sarcastic remarks.
         - the context of the message is a birthday celebration, but the tone is not genuinely celebratory, which suggests sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        4. **rhetorical devices**: the tweet uses irony by stating the opposite of what is commonly believed, which is a classic characteristic of sarcasm.

         the tweet contains several cues that suggest sarcasm. 

         1. **surface emotion:** the use of the hashtag #funny and the phrase ""turn on"" may initially suggest a positive or playful tone. however, the word ""disgusting"" and the topic of the tweet (hotels) suggest that the tone is actually negative. this contrast between the surface-level positivity and the underlying negativity is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

         2. **punctuation:** the use of multiple colons and pipes (||) creates a sense of drama and emphasis, which can be indicative of sarcasm.

         3. **topic:** the topic of the tweet, hotels, is a mundane and everyday topic, which is often the subject of sarcastic comments.

         4. **cultural background:** the use of hashtags and the informal tone of the tweet suggest that it is from a western cultural context, where sarcasm is a common form of humor.

         5. **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""#not all men"" is a clear example of irony and sarcasm, as it is a phrase often used in a humorous or mocking way to downplay or dismiss criticisms.

        ### explanation: 

        this tweet is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the presence of several cues. 

        - surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed in this tweet is negative (feeling ill, hurting to breathe), but the tone is ironic and exaggerated. 
        - language style: the language used is informal, with a sarcastic tone conveyed through the use of hyperbole ('hurts to breathe'). 
        - rhetorical devices: the use of irony and hyperbole are rhetorical devices that suggest sarcasm. 
        - special symbols: the hashtag '#not' is a special symbol that implies the opposite of what the sentence is saying, which is a common way to express sarcasm. 
        - cultural background: the use of hashtags and informal language is common in social media platforms, particularly twitter, where sarcasm is often used to express irony or frustration. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the tweet is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the cues that suggest this text is sarcastic include: 

        1. emotional words: 'hurts' indicates pain and discomfort, but the tone of the sentence is opposite to what you would expect, suggesting sarcasm.
        2. cultural background: the use of '#not' at the end, which is a common internet slang, implies sarcasm.
        3. keywords: the phrase 'did me the world of good' is an idiomatic expression that typically means something has had a very positive effect. however, in this context, it's used to convey the opposite meaning.
        4. punctuation: the use of the period after 'good' creates a sense of finality, which contrasts with the expected tone of the sentence, adding to the sarcastic tone.
        5. emotional contrasts: the contrast between the negative emotion expressed in the first sentence ('it actually hurts to breathe') and the positive sentiment expressed in the second sentence ('did me the world of good') creates a sense of irony, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        * punctuation: the text uses multiple hashtags (#everythingisfine, #not, #sonot) which are often used to convey irony or sarcasm.
        * language style: the text uses the phrase ""everything is fine"" which is a clear exaggeration and indicates the opposite meaning, i.e., everything is not fine.
        * context: the context of the text implies that the speaker is surprised or annoyed to find out that two famous actors were in marrakech just before they are going, which is an unusual coincidence.
        * emotional words: the use of ""not"" in all capital letters indicates strong emotions, likely frustration or annoyance.

        ### reasoning: 

         the presence of the hashtags #not and #sonot clearly indicate that the speaker is being sarcastic. the use of the phrase ""everythingisfine"" also suggests a tone of irony. the context of the situation, with two famous people being in marrakech before the speaker, implies that the speaker is being facetious about the coincidence. the use of the phrase ""just one week before i'm going there"" adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker thinks it's a big deal that they will be in the same place as the celebrities, but not really. overall, the combination of these cues points towards a sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        3. **language style:** the text appears to be written in a playful, tongue-in-cheek style, with an exaggerated tone. the use of contradictory statements (""#money|#not"") and the juxtaposition of opposing ideas (""smiles"" vs. ""scowls"") may suggest sarcasm.

        4. **common knowledge:** the mention of ""god"" with a dollar sign ($) and heart symbols (💔) could be seen as ironic or sarcastic, as it's an unusual combination.

        5. **punctuation:** the excessive use of punctuation marks, such as pipes (|) and quotation marks (""'""), adds to the overall playful and sarcastic tone of the text.

        ### reasoning:
        the text has multiple cues indicating sarcasm:

2. **context**: the phrase ""gotta love"" is a common expression used to convey irony or sarcasm, especially when followed by a negative experience (""being lied to"").

3. **surface emotion**: the text explicitly states a negative emotion (""being lied to""), which contrasts with the initial phrase ""gotta love"", suggesting sarcasm.

4. **topic**: the topic of being lied to is a sensitive and frustrating experience, making the use of irony and sarcasm more likely.

5. **emotional contrasts**: the contrast between the initial phrase (""gotta love"") and the negative experience (""being lied to"") creates an emotional contrast that suggests sarcasm.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the tweet is sarcastic because it employs several cues that indicate sarcasm. firstly, it uses a rhetorical device of irony, where the speaker says the opposite of what they mean. the phrase ""ladies wouldn't use that language"" is a polite and respectful phrase, but it is used to imply that the person being addressed is not a lady, which is a negative and condescending comment. the phrase ""but i guess you are not one"" is a clear example of irony, as the speaker is implying that the person is not a lady, which is the opposite of what they initially said. 

        secondly, the tweet uses emotional contrast, where the speaker starts with a polite and respectful phrase, but ends with a condescending and negative comment. this contrast between the positive and negative emotions indicates sarcasm.

        thirdly, the tweet contains keywords that are often used in sarcastic language, such as ""but"" and ""i guess"". these keywords are often used to indicate irony or sarcasm.

        fourthly, the tweet contains emotional words such as ""ladies"" which is a polite and respectful term, but is used in a condescending way, which indicates sarcasm.

        finally, the tweet assumes common knowledge that ladies are supposed to be polite and respectful, but the speaker is implying that the person being addressed is not, which is a sarcastic comment.

        therefore, based on these cues, the tweet is labeled as sarcastic.",1.0,"the assigned label for the given input text is 'sarcastic'. 

         the cues that lead to this classification are:

         - rhetorical devices: the phrase 'but i guess you are not one' is an example of irony, implying the opposite of what is being said. this is a common rhetorical device used in sarcastic language.

         - surface emotion: the phrase 'ladies wouldn't use that language' appears to be a statement of disapproval, but the tone is actually mocking and condescending.

         - emotional contrasts: the contrast between the seemingly polite phrase 'ladies wouldn't use that language' and the implied insult that follows creates a sense of emotional contrast, which is a characteristic of sarcastic language.

         - special symbols: the '@' symbol is used to address someone, but in this context, it may also be used to imply a sense of familiarity or mocking tone.

         - punctuation: the use of a period at the end of the sentence adds a sense of finality and emphasis to the statement, which can be seen as sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' due to the following cues:

        1. **topic**: the topic is a response to someone's language, which often involves tone and attitude.

        2. **punctuation**: the use of 'but' at the beginning of the second sentence indicates a contrast, which is a common feature of sarcastic statements.

        3. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion is seemingly polite and condescending, which is often a sign of sarcasm.

        4. **keywords**: the keyword 'but' and the phrase 'ladies wouldn't use that language' imply a tone of mockery.

        5. **common knowledge**: it is common knowledge that people often use sarcasm when responding to someone's language or behavior, especially when it involves criticism or judgment.

        ### reasoning:

        topic: the topic of the tweet seems to be a personal attack or insult.

        cultural background: the use of 'lol' (laugh out loud) is a common abbreviation in internet slang, which is often used in informal online communication, especially among younger people.

        language style: the language style is informal and conversational, with the use of the abbreviation 'lol' and the phrase 'i hate you', which is a common phrase used in a joking manner.

        rhetorical devices: the tweet uses irony, as the speaker says they 'hate' someone, but the use of 'lol' suggests that they are joking.

        keywords: 'hate', 'lol'. the word 'hate' is a strong word, but the presence of 'lol' suggests that the speaker does not actually mean it.

        rhetorical devices: none
        topic: none

        language style: the language used is informal and conversational, which is common in online communication. the tone is casual, but the use of 'i hate you' is an exaggeration, implying sarcasm.

        common knowledge: in everyday conversations, people rarely express hate towards someone they are interacting with, especially with a 'lol' at the end. this phrase is more likely to be used in a joking or sarcastic manner.

        surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is anger or hatred, but the use of 'lol' suggests that the speaker does not genuinely feel this way, making it a sarcastic statement.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        the tweet expresses frustration and annoyance at being hyper at 1 am when the speaker knows they should be sleeping. the use of the phrase ""oh whale"" is a sarcastic expression, implying the opposite of what is being said (i.e., ""oh great"" or ""oh wonderful""). the hashtags and emojis (🐋🐳) add to the sarcastic tone, suggesting the speaker is being facetious and not genuinely excited. the contrast between the expected behavior (sleeping) and the actual behavior (being hyper) also contributes to the sarcastic tone. overall, the tweet is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains cues that are typical of sarcastic language. the phrase ""hyper at 1am"" indicates a state of high energy, but the addition of ""when i really should be getting rest"" implies that the speaker is actually tired and frustrated, which is the opposite of what they claim. this emotional contrast between the surface emotion (excitement) and the underlying emotion (fatigue) is a common cue of sarcasm. the use of hashtags (#ohwhale) and emojis (🐋🐳) also adds a playful and ironic tone to the text, which is another characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,"the assigned label for this text is 'sarcastic'.

        ### rationale: 
        the cues that suggest the text is sarcastic are:

        * surface emotion: the text expresses hyperactivity and excitement, but it's at 1 am when the speaker should be sleeping, which is an unusual and contradictory situation.
        * common knowledge: it's common knowledge that people should get rest at night, especially at 1 am.
        * topic: the topic is about being hyper when one should be sleeping.
        * cultural background: the use of hashtags and emojis (e.g. #ohwhale 🐋🐳) is a cultural phenomenon commonly used in social media platforms, particularly among younger generations.
        * punctuation: the use of hashtags and emojis adds a playful tone to the text, which is often associated with sarcasm.

        these cues collectively suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic and ironic about being hyper at 1 am when they should be sleeping.",1.0,1.0

        * rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (""seven games and we've got progressively worse!"") and irony (""can't wait"") are rhetorical devices commonly used in sarcastic language.

         the tweet appears to be sarcastic because it uses the phrase ""not a fun time"" which is a clear indication of the opposite sentiment. the use of the hashtag ""#fun time"" is also ironic, implying that the writer is being facetious. furthermore, the tone of the tweet is casual and conversational, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic language. additionally, the use of the phrase ""any more"" implies that the writer is expressing a sense of disappointment or frustration, which is a common sentiment in sarcastic language. the hashtags ""#johnny"" and ""#football"" are likely used to add context to the tweet, but they do not contribute to the sarcastic tone. overall, the tweet's language and tone suggest that it is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation:

        the tweet is sarcastic because it includes special symbols such as hashtags (#) which are used to convey irony and emphasize the contrast between the literal meaning of the words and the intended meaning. the phrase ""not a fun time"" has an emotional contrast with the initial phrase ""fun time"", implying that the speaker is being sarcastic about the event. the topic of the tweet is about a sports team (cleveland browns) which is often associated with negative emotions, adding to the sarcastic tone. the punctuation used, such as the colon (:), separates the two contrasting phrases, further emphasizing the sarcasm. the surface emotion of the tweet appears to be negative, but the tone is actually sarcastic. therefore, the correct label for this tweet is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation:

        the label for the input text is 'sarcastic'. 

        cultural background: the text does not contain any specific cultural background cues. however, the topic and keywords suggest that the author is from the united states or has an interest in american football.

        topic: the topic of the text is american football, specifically the cleveland browns team.

        keywords: keywords that indicate sarcasm include 'not a fun time', which is an understatement and ironic considering the context of a football game. the hashtag '#football' also implies that the author is being facetious.

        rhetorical devices: the use of irony and understatement are rhetorical devices that contribute to the sarcastic tone of the text.

        language style: the language style is informal, with the use of hashtags and abbreviations ('#johnny', 'http://t.co/vm4e3dkexf'). the tone is casual and conversational, which is consistent with sarcasm. the use of phrases like 'not a fun time' also creates a sense of sarcasm and irony.",1.0,1.0

        - topic: the topic is college athletics, specifically the southeastern conference (sec).

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

        ### reason: 

        the tweet contains multiple cues indicating sarcasm:

1. **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""best christmas eve news"" is an obvious exaggeration, implying the opposite - that the news is not good at all.

2. **context:** the context of the tweet, specifically the mention of a half-sister, is an unexpected and potentially unwelcome surprise, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

3. **cultural background:** the use of hashtags like #sarcasm and #thanksdad suggests that the author is familiar with internet culture and is using irony to express their feelings.

4. **language style:** the tone of the tweet is informal and conversational, which is consistent with sarcastic language.

5. **punctuation:** the use of emojis like 😂 and 👍 is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as they are often used to convey irony or mockery.

considering these cues, it is clear that the tweet is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        1. keywords: 'best' and '#sarcasm' are strong indicators of sarcasm. the use of 'best' is ironic, as finding out about a half-sister on christmas eve might not be the best news for everyone.

        2. language style: the use of '#sarcasm' explicitly indicates sarcasm. the tone of the text is casual and conversational, which is consistent with sarcastic language.

        3. context: the context is christmas eve, which is typically a time for celebration and joy. the news of having a half-sister might not be what someone wants to hear on this day, making the 'best' part ironic and sarcastic.

        4. emotional contrasts: the use of 'best' and the emojis '😂' and '👍' convey a sense of excitement and positivity, but the context and the hashtag '#sarcasm' suggest the opposite emotions, creating an emotional contrast.

        5. emotional words: the word 'thanksdad' has a tone of annoyance and frustration, which is a common emotional tone associated with sarcasm.",1.0,"the label for this input text is 'sarcastic'. 

         here's why:

         - **common knowledge:** there is no common knowledge that getting a half-sister on christmas eve is a good thing, which hints at sarcasm.

         - **surface emotion:** the surface emotion is positive due to the use of 😂 and 👍 emojis, which contrasts with the expected negative emotion of getting a half-sister, indicating sarcasm.

         - **keywords:** the presence of the hashtag '#sarcasm' is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

         - **topic:** the topic is a personal, unexpected, and potentially negative event, which is often associated with sarcasm.

         - **punctuation:** the use of emojis like 😂 and 👍 adds a tone of irony and sarcasm to the text.

         4. **keywords:** the hashtag ""#not"" might be interpreted as a hint towards the sarcastic tone.

         5. **common knowledge:** it's common for siblings to resemble each other, making the statement ""we don't look alike"" unusual, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

        the given text contains several cues indicating sarcasm. firstly, the language style is informal and conversational, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic tone. the use of hyperbole (""exactly what i want to be doing"") is a rhetorical device that emphasizes the opposite of what the speaker means. the emotional contrast between the expected positive sentiment of ""what i want"" and the unpleasant activity of ""throwing up"" also suggests sarcasm. additionally, the use of emojis (😷😷😷) intensifies the emotional tone and adds a layer of irony. finally, the hashtag ""#not"" is a special symbol that explicitly indicates the opposite of what the text literally says, which is a common way to convey sarcasm. all these cues collectively point towards the label 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        ","i would label this text as 'sarcastic'. 

         here's why: 

         - **language style**: the use of the phrase '#goodluck' in an ironic tone implies that the task is impossible or very difficult, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.
         - **emotional contrast**: the tone of the tweet seems to be one of frustration or annoyance, which contrasts with the seemingly casual and lighthearted tone of the hashtags.
         - **rhetorical devices**: the use of the hashtag '#goodluck' can be seen as a form of irony, as the speaker is implying that the task is impossible, rather than genuinely wishing the person good luck.
         - **topic**: the topic of the tweet is a mundane task (remembering which book), which adds to the sarcastic tone.
         - **context**: the tweet is a response to someone, which implies that the speaker is being facetious and playful in their response, rather than genuinely offering advice or support.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 
        surface emotion: the surface emotion of the tweet is neutral. 

        cultural background: the cultural background of the tweet is western, specifically english-speaking. 

        emotional words: there are no emotional words in the tweet. 

        context: the context of the tweet is unclear without knowing what the previous tweet or conversation was about. 

        topic: the topic of the tweet is related to remembering which book, possibly a task that the author is dreading. 

        the use of '#goodluck' at the end of the tweet implies that the author is being sarcastic, as they are implying that they will need good luck to accomplish the task, which is an exaggeration. therefore, the label of the tweet is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 
        the cues i extracted from the input text to assign a correct label are:

        1. keywords: the word 'goodluck' is often used in a sarcastic tone when someone is being facetious or unhelpful.

        2. context: the context of the sentence implies that the speaker is being sarcastic by saying 'goodluck' to someone who is trying to remember something, implying that it's an impossible task.

        3. emotional words: the word 'goodluck' has a positive connotation, but in this context, it's being used in a way that is opposite of its original meaning, implying sarcasm.

        4. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the sentence is neutral or slightly positive due to the word 'goodluck', but the underlying emotion is sarcastic.

        5. emotional contrasts: the contrast between the surface emotion (positive) and the underlying emotion (sarcastic) is a cue for sarcasm.

        therefore, based on these cues, i assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text.",1.0,1.0

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains several cues that suggest sarcasm.

        3. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase'so glad' is an example of irony, as the writer is clearly not glad to be at work at 7:30am.

        this tweet is classified as sarcastic because it contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. **special symbols**: the tweet starts with '@', which is a common way to address someone on twitter. however, in this context, it's used to respond to someone (deray) in a somewhat confrontational manner, setting a sarcastic tone.

2. **surface emotion**: the phrase ""definitely not"" appears to be sarcastic, implying the opposite of what it literally says.

3. **topic**: the topic of racism and its systematic presence in american institutions is a serious issue. the use of irony and sarcasm in this context is a way to express frustration and annoyance.

4. **punctuation**: the use of an ellipsis (...) after ""definitely not"" creates a sense of hesitation or uncertainty, which is ironic given the strong statement that follows.

5. **rhetorical devices**: the use of irony and understatement (""definitely not..."") are rhetorical devices that suggest sarcasm.

         2. **language style**: the phrase 'definitely not' is often used in a sarcastic tone to express the opposite, and the use of 'also' at the end of the sentence can be seen as a sarcastic addition.

        ### reasoning: 

        the input text contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. emotional words: the word ""definitely"" is often used to express strong emotions, which can be a sign of sarcasm.

        2. special symbols: the use of ellipsis (...) can be interpreted as a sign of sarcasm, as it implies a tone of irony or mocking.

        3. punctuation: the use of ""...not"" followed by a statement that is the opposite of what is expected (""racism is systematic and entrenched in every american institution"") creates a sense of irony and sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the text is labeled as sarcastic because it contains a few cues that indicate sarcasm. firstly, the use of the phrase ""walk into a bar"" is a classic setup for a joke, which already hints at a lighthearted and playful tone. the phrase ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" is a common phrase used to deflect blame, and the fact that both mike smith and brian hoyer say it in unison is an exaggeration that adds to the comedic effect. the use of hashtags #coyotes and #browns also suggests that the joke is related to sports, and the humor is likely ironic or sarcastic. overall, the text uses language style and emotional contrasts to convey a sarcastic tone.

        note: emotional words used in the text are ""fault"" which has a slightly negative connotation, but the overall tone is playful and humorous. there are no obvious rhetorical devices used in the text, but the use of a joke setup and punchline can be considered a form of rhetorical device. keywords that indicate sarcasm are ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" and the use of hashtags.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        - surface emotion: the text does not explicitly express a strong emotion, but the situation is absurd, implying irony. 
        - punctuation: the use of the ""#"" symbol and the quotation marks around the phrase ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" suggests a sense of playfulness and irony. 
        - rhetorical devices: the joke relies on a play on the common phrase ""a man walks into a bar"" and the unexpected punchline, which is a form of irony. 
        - topic: the topic is a joke about two people, mike smith and brian hoyer, who are likely sports figures, making excuses for their mistakes. 
        - language style: the language is casual and conversational, with a touch of humor, which is typical of sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

         the given text is sarcastic because it uses a play on the common phrase ""a man walks into a bar"" which is usually the start of a joke. the punchline here is not a joke but rather a phrase that seems out of place, implying that mike smith and brian hoyer are both making excuses, which is a common trope in sports (especially in the nfl, as hinted by the #coyotes and #browns hashtags). the humor comes from the unexpected twist on the familiar setup and the relatable situation of people making excuses. this use of wordplay, irony, and cultural knowledge makes the text sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

         the text is labeled as sarcastic because it contains the phrase ""tough crowd"" which is often used to express irony or sarcasm. the tone of the sentence is also informal and casual, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of the phrase ""tremendous tonight"" is also an exaggeration, which is another cue for sarcasm. additionally, the text includes the @ symbol, which is often used in social media platforms, and the language style is informal, which are also indicative of sarcastic tone. the cultural background of the text appears to be western, possibly american, based on the language and the reference to a person named josh smith, which is a common name in the us. the surface emotion of the text is negative, as it implies that the crowd was tough, but the overall tone is sarcastic rather than genuinely negative. the topic of the text is sports, as it mentions josh smith, who is likely a sports figure. there are no special symbols in the text other than the @ symbol.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### reasoning: 

        the context of the tweet implies that josh smith did not do well tonight, but the user is saying the opposite, which is a classic sign of sarcasm. the surface emotion of the text appears to be positive, but it's actually negative. the punctuation (the period) doesn't add much to the sarcasm, but the keyword ""tough crowd"" is often used to express irony or sarcasm. the cultural background of twitter, where sarcasm is commonly used, also supports the classification of this text as sarcastic.",1.0,"the label for the given text is 'sarcastic'.

         here's the analysis of the text based on the cues:

         **keywords:** 'tough crowd' is a phrase often used in a sarcastic tone, implying the opposite - that the crowd is easy to impress.

         **topic:** the topic is a performance by josh smith, which is not inherently sarcastic.

         **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the text is positive, with the word 'tremendous' used to describe josh smith's performance.

         **rhetorical devices:** the text uses irony, which is a rhetorical device often employed in sarcastic language. the speaker says the crowd is tough, but the tone implies the opposite.

         **language style:** the language style is informal, with a tone that is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is often characteristic of sarcastic language.

         considering these cues, the text is likely to be sarcastic, implying that the crowd was not tough at all, and josh smith's performance was not as impressive as the speaker is claiming.",1.0,1.0

        this text is classified as sarcastic due to the presence of several cues:

        1. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase 'isn't that fun' is used in an ironic way, implying the opposite meaning of what the words literally say.

        2. **emotional contrasts**: the text expresses a negative emotion (someone took the lucky hat) but uses a positive phrase ('yay') to convey the opposite sentiment.

        3. **punctuation**: the use of an ellipsis (...) after 'fun' suggests a tone of frustration or annoyance, which contrasts with the initial positive phrase.

        4. **topic**: the topic of the text is a personal loss (someone took the lucky hat), which is often a source of frustration or annoyance.

        5. **language style**: the use of hashtags (#sarcasm, #ihopeigetitback) explicitly indicates that the text is meant to be sarcastic. the informal tone and colloquial language ('yay') also suggest a casual, tongue-in-cheek style that is often associated with sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### explanation:

         - the use of the ellipsis (...) and the tone of the sentence also suggest a sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

         ### explanation: 

         the presence of special symbols '#sarcasm' is a strong indicator of sarcasm. additionally, the use of emotional words like 'fun' in a context where it's clear the speaker is unhappy about their hat being taken, implies sarcasm. the tone of the sentence, especially the use of 'yay' and the trailing off with '...' also contribute to the sarcastic tone. the context of the situation, i.e., someone taking someone else's property, is also a common scenario where people might use sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 
        the label 'sarcastic' is assigned to the given input text because it contains cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase 'not the most, but not bad' is a classic example of understatement, which is a rhetorical device often used to convey sarcasm. the speaker is downplaying their achievement to appear humble, but the tone is ironic.

        2. **tone**: the tone of the sentence is casual and playful, which is another indicator of sarcasm. the use of the hashtag symbol (#) and the casual language ('not bad') contribute to this tone.

        3. **context**: the context of the sentence is a bragging statement, but the speaker is trying to appear modest by downplaying their achievement. this contrast between the literal meaning and the intended tone is a common feature of sarcastic language.

        4. **keywords**: the keyword 'not bad' is a phrase often used sarcastically to express the opposite sentiment. it implies that the speaker's achievement is actually impressive, but they're being humble about it.

        ### explanation: 

        this text is labeled as sarcastic because it contains several cues that indicate sarcasm. 

        1. **emotional contrasts**: the text starts with a statement of accomplishment (visiting 19 states, 2 provinces, and 11 countries), which would typically be associated with pride or excitement. however, it's followed by a downplaying comment (""not the most, but not bad""), which contrasts with the initial statement and implies sarcasm.

        2. **punctuation**: the use of parentheses around the downplaying comment further emphasizes its sarcastic tone.

        3. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion of the text appears to be casual or humble, but the underlying tone is sarcastic.

        4. **emotional words**: although there are no overtly emotional words in the text, the phrase ""not the most, but not bad"" has a sarcastic tone.

        5. **topic**: the topic of traveling and visiting places is not inherently sarcastic, but the way it's presented in the text suggests sarcasm.

        Just a @ScienceDaily article re: a robot arm you can control with your mind. Meh. Nothing huge. #sarcasm #science http://t.co/AK4bAorhBc

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

         this input text is labeled as sarcastic. here's why:

         1. emotional words: the word ""meh"" is used, which is an emotional word indicating a sense of indifference or boredom, which is often used in a sarcastic tone.

         2. punctuation: the use of a period after ""nothing huge"" can be interpreted as a pause, which can add to the sarcastic tone.

         3. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be nonchalant, but the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" clearly indicates that the author intended to be sarcastic.

         4. rhetorical devices: the text uses understatement, as the author describes a seemingly impressive technological achievement as ""nothing huge"".

         5. context: the context of the article being shared, which is about a robot arm controlled by the mind, is impressive, but the author downplays it, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

         therefore, based on these cues, the text is classified as sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### explanation: 

         the presence of '#sarcasm' in the tweet is a clear indicator of sarcasm. additionally, the word 'meh' and the tone of the sentence 'nothing huge' convey a sense of irony and understatement, which are typical characteristics of sarcastic language. the use of '@' to mention sciencedaily and the hashtag '#science' also suggest a casual and informal tone, which is often associated with sarcastic language. overall, the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the tweet is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

         * topic: science and technology

         * emotional contrasts: the contrast between the excitement and novelty of the article's topic (controlling a robot arm with your mind) and the speaker's dismissive tone (""meh"", ""nothing huge"") suggests sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        i have assigned the label 'sarcastic' to the given text. here's why:

        - **context:** the context of the text seems to be a sports game, possibly football, and the author is expressing their disbelief at a penalty call made by the referee.
        - **punctuation:** the use of '..' (two dots) at the end of the first sentence is an indication of irony or sarcasm. the hashtags '#hadone' and '#stoke' also suggest a casual and playful tone.
        - **topic:** the topic of the text is a sports game, which is often an emotional and opinionated topic. the author's use of strong language like'stonewall penalty' implies a strong opinion.
        - **language style:** the language used is informal and conversational, with a touch of humor. the use of rhetorical questions like 'what are these refs on?' is also a common trait of sarcastic language.
        - **common knowledge:** it's common knowledge that referees in sports games can make mistakes, and the author is using sarcasm to express their frustration and disbelief at the referee's decision.

        putting all these cues together, it's clear that the author is being sarcastic in their tone, hence the label 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

         ### reasoning: 

        the input text is classified as sarcastic because of the following cues:

        4. cultural background: the use of hashtags and the language style is reminiscent of social media platforms, which often employ sarcasm and irony in online interactions.

         ### explanation: 

        the text is sarcastic due to several cues. firstly, the surface emotion expressed is positive, with words like 'beauty', 'beautiful', and 'love', but the context is actually negative, implying the speaker is being ironic. the use of hashtags like '#lovethwayyoulie' is also a clear indication of sarcasm, as it's unlikely someone would genuinely appreciate being lied to. the use of 'not' at the end in all capital letters adds to the sarcastic tone, implying the opposite of what's being said. additionally, the phrase 'the sucky thing' already sets a negative tone, contrasting with the seemingly positive sentiment that follows. the cultural background of the phrase '#beautifulliar' being a song title also adds to the irony, as the song is about a toxic relationship, not something to be admired. overall, the combination of emotional contrasts, ironic hashtags, and punctuation all point to a sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains several cues indicating sarcasm. 

        1. **cultural background**: the text is from twitter, a platform known for its informal and humorous tone, which increases the likelihood of sarcasm.

        2. **language style**: the language used is overly flattering and exaggerated (""you blew my mind"", ""you're brilliant""), which is a common trait of sarcastic texts.

        3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of hyperbole (""blew my mind"") is a rhetorical device often employed in sarcastic language to convey irony.

        4. **punctuation**: the presence of an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence adds to the exaggerated tone, further suggesting sarcasm.

        5. **emotional words**: the words ""brilliant"" and ""blew my mind"" have strong positive connotations, which, in the context of an over-the-top compliment, imply sarcasm rather than genuine admiration.

        ### reasoning: 

        the input text contains emotional contrasts, as the words ""blew my mind"" and ""brilliant"" convey a strong positive sentiment, but the tone is likely sarcastic because the praise is overly exaggerated. this type of language is often used to express the opposite of what is literally meant, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the use of hashtags like #ahsfreakshow also suggests a casual, informal tone, which can be indicative of sarcasm. the context of the tweet, which appears to be a response to someone's performance in a tv show, also supports the interpretation of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        * cultural background: the mention of ""arsenal"" and ""#afc"" suggests a context of english football, where finishing fourth is not a desirable outcome. the irony lies in the fact that the team is expected to do better.
        * punctuation: the use of a period at the end of the sentence adds a sense of finality and certainty, which contrasts with the irony and sarcasm in the statement.

         overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the text is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### explanation: 

         the text is sarcastic because of the following cues:

         1. **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""what a lovely"" is a clear example of irony, as the speaker is being facetious about the weather. the word ""lovely"" is used in a way that is opposite of its literal meaning, implying that the weather is not lovely at all.

         2. **punctuation:** the use of the hashtag ""#doomandgloom"" is a clear indication of sarcasm, as it's an exaggerated and melodramatic expression that contrasts with the literal meaning of the phrase ""what a lovely perma-fall"".

         3. **surface emotion:** the tone of the text appears to be negative, with the speaker expressing frustration about the weather, but the use of the word ""lovely"" and the hashtags ""#not #doomandgloom"" suggests that the speaker is being facetious and sarcastic.

         4. **common knowledge:** it's common knowledge that people generally prefer sunny or snowy weather over perpetual fall weather, so the speaker's statement is an obvious exaggeration.

         5. **emotional contrasts:** the contrast between the literal meaning of ""what a lovely perma-fall"" and the speaker's actual frustration with the weather creates a sense of irony and sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        the label assigned to this input is 'sarcastic'.

        - emotional contrast: the contrast between the positive description of the road ('very well cleaned country road') and the negative event ('get sucked into ditch') creates an emotional contrast. 

        - rhetorical device: the use of irony (as explicitly stated in the hashtag) is a rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm. 

        - context: the context of the tweet is an unexpected event, which adds to the sarcastic tone. 

        - topic: the topic of the tweet is an everyday situation, but the unexpected twist adds to the sarcasm. 

        - language style: the use of a casual tone and the inclusion of a hashtag (#irony) suggests a playful and tongue-in-cheek language style, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning:

        ### explanation: 

        the label for the given input is 'sarcastic'. 

        the cues used to classify this text as sarcastic are: 

        1. **emotional contrast**: the text expresses a contradictory sentiment. the phrase ""necrophelic"" (attracted to dead things) has a negative connotation, but the hashtag ""#justajoke"" and ""#notintodeadthings"" indicate that the speaker is not serious about their claim.

        2. **language style**: the use of hashtags ""#justajoke"" and ""#notintodeadthings"" is a common way to convey sarcasm on social media platforms. it's a way of saying ""i'm not really serious about this, i'm just joking.""

        3. **common knowledge**: the context of the tweet, mentioning ""#latinfinal"", suggests that the speaker is a student who has just finished a latin final exam. the joke about being ""necrophelic"" is likely a humorous exaggeration of their relief or exhaustion after the exam. the common knowledge that students often joke about being ""dead"" or ""dying"" after a difficult exam adds to the sarcastic tone.

        the context of the input text is a person expressing their ""favorite thing"" but the description of the activity is clearly unpleasant (waking up early, driving in the snow). the emotional contrast between the expected positive sentiment associated with a ""favorite thing"" and the actual negative experience described indicates sarcasm. the use of strong language (""bitch ass"") and hashtags like ""#not"" also suggest sarcasm. the cultural background and language style are informal and conversational, which is consistent with social media posts where sarcasm is common. the special symbol ""#"" is used to indicate a hashtag, which is a common feature of twitter posts where sarcasm is prevalent. overall, the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reason: 

        the text contains several cues that indicate it is sarcastic. firstly, the use of the phrase ""my favorite thing"" is a clear example of emotional contrast, as waking up early and driving in the snow is unlikely to be someone's genuine favorite activity. additionally, the use of the word ""bitch"" to describe the store panera is an example of a rhetorical device, specifically hyperbole, which is often used in sarcastic language. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#paneraproteam"" also suggest that the speaker is being facetious and ironic. furthermore, the tone of the tweet is informal and conversational, which is consistent with the tone often used in sarcastic language. finally, the context of the tweet, which appears to be a complaint about having to go to panera early in the morning, also supports the conclusion that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

         the tweet is sarcastic because of the use of the hashtag #unimpressed, which is an emotional contrast to the unpleasant and exaggerated situation described in the tweet. the use of hyperbole (""filled my head with snot"") is also a rhetorical device that adds to the sarcastic tone. the punctuation mark (&) is used to add a casual and playful tone to the tweet, which is typical of sarcastic language. overall, the tweet is an obvious exaggeration and the use of the hashtag #unimpressed makes it clear that the author is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning:

        2. emotional contrast: the use of ""unimpressed"" contradicts the description of the uncomfortable and unpleasant experience described in the sentence.

        4. cultural background: the use of hashtags (#unimpressed) is a common practice in social media and is often used to convey irony or sarcasm.

        ### explanation:

         the presence of emotional words such as 'unimpressed' indicates a strong negative emotion, which is a cue for sarcasm. the use of hyperbole ('filled my head with snot & used a cheese grater on the back of my throat') is also a common feature of sarcastic language, as it is an exaggeration of the speaker's physical discomfort. the hashtags '#unimpressed' further reinforce the sarcastic tone. the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of social media platforms where sarcasm is often used. the surface emotion expressed is annoyance and frustration, but the emotional contrast between the literal meaning of the sentence and the implied meaning ('i'm not impressed') suggests sarcasm. therefore, the correct label for this text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        3. common knowledge: the use of '#not' in the hashtag list also implies that the speaker is being facetious.
        4. surface emotion: the initial statement 'now i hate my brother even more' is an exaggeration, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. the tone of the sentence is also informal and playful, which is consistent with sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        this tweet is labeled as sarcastic because of the following cues:

1. **punctuation:** the use of all capital letters for ""radical islam"" and the exclamation mark in the hashtag ""#peshawarattack"" convey a strong emotional tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.

2. **emotional words:** words like ""satan's army"" have a strong negative connotation and are often used in a sarcastic tone to express disgust or outrage.

3. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion of the tweet appears to be one of anger and disgust, but the use of hyperbole (""cannot be human"") and the dramatic language (""satan's army"") suggest that the tone is actually sarcastic.

4. **language style:** the language used is dramatic and exaggerated, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

5. **keywords:** the keywords ""radical islam"" and ""satan's army"" are used in a way that is clearly hyperbolic and intended to be ironic, which is a hallmark of sarcastic language.

        ### cues:
        * emotional contrast: the use of strong words like ""satan's army"" and ""cannot be human"" indicates a strong emotional tone, but it's not ironic or contradictory, hence not sarcastic.
        * common knowledge: the context of the peshawar attack is a real event, and the sentiment expressed is a genuine outrage and condemnation.
        * cultural background: the mention of islam and satan's army suggests a cultural background that is likely religious and conservative, but it doesn't imply sarcasm.
        * topic: the topic is a serious issue like terrorism and religious extremism, which is not typically associated with sarcasm.
        * surface emotion: the surface emotion is one of anger, outrage, and condemnation, which is consistent with the topic and not sarcastic.",0.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation:

        the label assigned to this input text is 'sarcastic'. here's why:

        1. **common knowledge:** the mention of peshawarattack in the hashtag is a reference to a real-life terrorist attack, which is a serious topic. however, the tone of the text is not somber or empathetic, suggesting sarcasm.

        2. **punctuation:** the excessive use of capitalization (e.g., ""radical islam"") and the use of an equals sign (=) to equate ""radical islam"" with ""satan's army"" are attention-grabbing and sensational, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic text.

        3. **keywords:** phrases like ""cannot be human"" and ""satan's army"" have a hyperbolic tone, which is typical of sarcastic language.

        4. **rhetorical devices:** the use of hyperbole (""cannot be human"") and metaphor (""satan's army"") adds to the sarcastic tone.

        5. **emotional words:** the text contains strong emotional words like ""satan,"" which is often used to evoke a sense of evil or malevolence. the tone, however, is more sensational than genuinely outraged, suggesting sarcasm.

        - rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole ('welll helllo fever') and irony ('feel real good') are common rhetorical devices used in sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation:

        ### Label: 

        ","after analyzing the input text, i assigned the label: 'sarcastic'. here's the explanation:

        **topic:** the topic is about age and behavior, with a hint of humor.

        **emotional contrasts:** the text contrasts the expectation of being ""old enough to know better"" (implying maturity and responsibility) with the unexpected behavior of ""doing it again"" (implying a lack of maturity and responsibility). this contrast creates a sense of irony and sarcasm.

        **language style:** the use of ""lol"" and the ellipsis (...) creates a casual and playful tone, which is typical of sarcastic language.

        **common knowledge:** the phrase ""old enough to know better"" is a common expression that implies wisdom and maturity. the text subverts this expectation by adding ""young enough to do it again,"" which is an unexpected twist.

        **rhetorical devices:** the text employs irony and understatement to convey sarcasm. the phrase ""old enough to know better"" is used ironically, as the speaker is implying the opposite - that they are not mature enough to behave responsibly. the understatement ""young enough to do it again"" adds to the sarcastic tone.

        based on these cues, the text is labeled as 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the text exhibits emotional contrasts by using ""lol"" which indicates amusement, and the phrase ""old enough to know better"" which implies a sense of maturity and responsibility. however, the second part of the sentence ""young enough to do it again"" implies a willingness to engage in a behavior that might not be responsible, hence the contrast. the keyword ""lol"" also hints at a playful tone, and the cultural background of social media platforms suggests that the tone is informal and conversational. the punctuation, specifically the use of "".."" and ""lol"" also adds to the playful and casual tone. overall, these cues suggest that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is labeled as sarcastic because it contains the following cues: 
        1. emotional words: 'lol', indicating amusement or mockery. 
        2. keywords: 'old enough to know better', which implies that the person should be mature enough to make wise decisions, but the following phrase 'young enough to do it again' contrasts with this idea, implying a sense of irony and sarcasm. 
        3. emotional contrasts: the contrast between the two phrases creates an emotional contrast, where the first part sounds serious and responsible, but the second part is playful and carefree. 
        4. rhetorical devices: the use of ellipsis (...) at the end of the sentence adds a touch of casualness and informality, which can be interpreted as sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        - punctuation: the excessive use of exclamation marks and hashtags adds to the sarcastic tone.

        - special symbols: the use of ""#sarcasm"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

        - context: the hashtags ""#donttrustnobody"" and ""#iwokeuplikethis"" imply that the speaker is not genuinely inspired or excited about monday morning, but rather the opposite.

         - the phrase ""it's true ho"" and ""don't trust nobody"" are contradictory to the initial phrase ""monday morning inspiration"", implying irony and sarcasm.

         - the phrase ""iwokeuplikethis"" is a common phrase used to express a sense of being unimpressed or unenthusiastic, which is a sarcastic tone.

        ### explanation: 

        this text is labeled as sarcastic. the cues that led to this classification are:
        1. rhetorical devices: the text starts with a negative statement 'my mom is the most annoying person i know', but later reveals that it's actually a joke by saying's/o to my mom' and '#istillloveyou', which implies that the initial statement was sarcastic.
        2. keywords: the presence of '#idc' (short for 'i don't care') and '#istillloveyou' suggests that the tone of the text is playful and sarcastic.
        3. language style: the use of informal language, abbreviations, and hashtags is typical of a casual, tongue-in-cheek tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.
        4. special symbols: the presence of '#', '@' symbols and abbreviations like's/o' (short for'shoutout') contribute to the playful and sarcastic tone of the text.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the input text exhibits several cues that indicate sarcasm. firstly, the presence of emotional words like ""annoying"" with a negative connotation suggests a strong sentiment. however, the tone shifts with the usage of the phrase ""s/o to my mom"" which is a casual and informal way of expressing gratitude, contradicting the initial negative sentiment. this inconsistency is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

        furthermore, the use of hashtags ""#idc"" (short for ""i don't care"") and ""#istillloveyou"" implies a sense of irony and contradiction, as the speaker is expressing both indifference and affection towards their mom. this mix of emotions and the casual tone of the text are typical characteristics of sarcasm.

        the cultural background of the text also plays a role, as the use of hashtags, informal language, and internet slang (""creep my account"") suggest a younger, more internet-savvy audience, which is more likely to use sarcasm in online communication.

        finally, the punctuation and special symbols used, such as ""#"" and ""/"", add to the casual and playful tone of the text, which is consistent with the tone of sarcastic language. overall, the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the use of hashtags ""#idc#istillloveyou"" is a cue for sarcasm, as it is a contradictory statement to the initial phrase ""my mom is the most annoying person i know"". the use of ""#idc"" (short for ""i don't care"") implies the opposite, that the speaker actually does care about their mom's feelings. the phrase ""s/o to my mom"" is also a sarcastic way of saying ""shoutout"" or giving a compliment, which is ironic given the initial negative statement. the context and tone of the post, including the use of informal language and internet slang, also suggest sarcasm. overall, the emotional contrast between the initial negative statement and the subsequent affectionate hashtags is a strong indicator of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

         the surface emotion in this text is frustration and discomfort, but the tone is sarcastic. the use of the phrase ""that's just what i needed"" is a rhetorical device, specifically irony, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. the context of waking up with a swollen foot implies that the situation is not desirable, and the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#ouch"" further reinforce the sarcastic tone. the contrast between the literal meaning of the sentence and the speaker's intended meaning also suggests sarcasm. finally, common knowledge tells us that waking up with a swollen foot is not a pleasant experience, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        ","i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. 

         here's why:

         * cultural background: the mention of ""vitamin netty pot combo blast"" is a colloquialism commonly used in western cultures, particularly in the uk. this gives a hint about the tone of the text.

         * rhetorical devices: the use of irony (""thankfully not full cold"") and exaggeration (""full vitamin netty pot combo blast"") are strong indicators of sarcasm.

         * topic: the topic of the text appears to be a humorous take on a common cold or a minor illness, which is often used as a subject for sarcasm.

         * punctuation: the use of "".."" and the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence suggests a playful, tongue-in-cheek tone, which is consistent with sarcasm.

         * context: the context of the tweet, including the username ""@chantalireland"" and the informal language, suggests a casual, conversational tone that is often associated with sarcasm. overall, the cues suggest that the text is intended to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine expression of gratitude.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation:

        the text includes several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. **special symbols**: the use of '@' symbol, which is a common way to address someone on social media, implies a tone of irony or sarcasm.
2. **keywords**: the phrase ""thankfully not full cold"" is followed by a contradictory statement ""just one side down"", which suggests that the speaker is being facetious.
3. **common knowledge**: the mention of ""vitamin netty pot combo blast"" is an obvious exaggeration, as neti pots are not typically associated with vitamins or combo blasts. this hyperbole implies sarcasm.
4. **context**: the context of the tweet, which appears to be a humorous complaint about a minor cold, suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.
5. **punctuation**: the use of periods and ellipses creates a tone of dry wit and irony, which is consistent with sarcasm.

overall, the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the tweet uses rhetorical devices like irony and sarcasm when saying ""thankfully not full cold"" and ""vitamin netty pot combo blast"" to express frustration and annoyance at having a cold. the use of words like ""thankfully"" and ""combo blast"" is exaggerated and implies the opposite of what the words literally mean. the language style is informal and conversational, with the use of colloquialisms like ""netty pot"". the tweet also uses common knowledge that having a cold is not desirable, and the speaker is being facetious when saying they're getting a ""vitamin"" from the netty pot. the punctuation, including the use of "".."" and the exclamation mark, adds to the sarcastic tone. the surface emotion expressed is frustration and annoyance, but the tone is playful and humorous, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        2. **random information**: the phrase ""just a random information"" at the end of the text implies that the author is being facetious about providing unnecessary information.

        2. **punctuation**: the use of multiple exclamation marks and parentheses creates a tone of mock enthusiasm and excitement, which is a typical trait of sarcastic language. 

        3. **emotional words**: although there are no overtly emotional words in the text, the tone conveyed by the punctuation and capitalization implies a sense of annoyance or frustration, which is often present in sarcastic language. 

        4. **common knowledge**: the mention of a specific date and time ('december 10, 2014 at 02:15pm') is an unusual and unnecessary detail, which may be intended to sound ridiculous or unimportant, adding to the sarcastic tone. 

        5. **topic**: the topic itself is mundane and lacks significance, which may be the point of the sarcastic tone, i.e., to highlight the triviality of the information being shared.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        this tweet is sarcastic because of the following cues:

        1. topic: the topic is jessica's tears at a fan signing event, which might be a sentimental or emotional topic, but the tone of the tweet is mocking or ironic.

        2. punctuation: the use of the winky face ;_; is a common way to express sarcasm or irony in online communication. it indicates that the speaker is being facetious or tongue-in-cheek.

        3. special symbols: the winky face ;_; is a special symbol that adds a layer of irony or sarcasm to the tweet.

        4. common knowledge: it's common knowledge that fan signing events are often emotional and sentimental, but the tone of the tweet is mocking or ironic, implying that the speaker doesn't actually think jessica's tears are moving or emotional.

        5. keywords: the phrase ""it makes me weak"" is a common phrase used to express admiration or sympathy, but in this context, it's likely being used sarcastically to imply that the speaker is actually annoyed or bored by jessica's tears.

        overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the tweet is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the tweet contains emotional contrasts (weakness vs. crying due to joy) and surface emotion (sarcasm is implied by the excessive use of semicolons and the phrase ""it makes me weak""). the context of the tweet is a fan's reaction to jessica's emotional display at a fan signing event, which is an unusual situation for a fan to be ""weak"" about. the topic is jessica's fan signing event, and the common knowledge is that fans usually react positively to their idols' emotional displays, but the tweet's tone is overly dramatic and ironic, suggesting sarcasm. therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        4. **language style**: the use of a casual, conversational tone, with phrases like ""or something"", creates a sense of informality, which is often associated with sarcasm.

        5. **rhetorical devices**: the use of irony (stated explicitly with the hashtag) and hyperbole (""or something"") are both rhetorical devices that are commonly used in sarcastic language.
