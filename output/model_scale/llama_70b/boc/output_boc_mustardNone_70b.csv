        the language style is formal and polite, but the content is quite the opposite. the sentence starts with ""well, i'm sorry, too"" which is a polite phrase, but then it says ""there's just no room for you in my wallet"" which is a clear rejection. this contrast between the polite language and the harsh content is a common cue for sarcasm. additionally, the use of the phrase ""i'm sorry, too"" can be seen as insincere, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"the label is 'sarcastic'.

        the cultural background cue: the dialogue is from the popular tv show ""the big bang theory"".

        the rhetorical device cue: the phrase ""there's just no room for you in my wallet"" is an obvious exaggeration and irony, indicating sarcasm.

        the response is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it uses context, common knowledge and emotional contrast cues. the context is the conversation about howard's concerns about being a synthetic human and still being jewish, and the topic is the jewish tradition of not working on saturdays. the common knowledge is that androids do not have to follow jewish traditions, but the speaker is using that knowledge to make a sarcastic comment. the emotional contrast is between the serious conversation about howard's concerns and the absurdity of powering down an android on saturdays. the punctuation, in this case, is not a significant cue, but the tone of the response is clearly sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        - rhetorical device: the use of ""not to mention"" implies that the speaker is being facetious and that the point is not actually important or relevant.

        - surface emotion: the surface emotion is frustration, but the tone is ironic.

        - emotional contrast: the contrast between the serious situation of an allergic reaction and the ridiculous exaggeration of the tongue swelling to the size of a brisket indicates sarcasm. 
        - language style: the use of hyperbole and irony in the sentence structure indicates a sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning:
        in this response, howard uses a hyperbole (""the size of a brisket"") to express his frustration and annoyance, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. the use of the rhetorical question (""now?!"") also implies sarcasm, as howard is being facetious and not genuinely asking for clarification. the language style is also informal and playful, which is often characteristic of sarcastic tone. finally, the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence adds to the emotional intensity and emphasizes the sarcastic tone.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 
        the use of the phrase ""lucky for her"" and the description of the fashion models as ""pruny and bug-eyed"" are clear indications of sarcasm. the use of the word ""lucky"" in this context is a rhetorical device used to convey the opposite meaning, implying that it is not lucky for giselle at all. the description of the fashion models is also an exaggeration and a hyperbole, which is another rhetorical device often used in sarcasm. additionally, the use of the word ""sadly"" at the beginning of the sentence is ironic, as the speaker is not actually sad about giselle's sensitivity to chlorine. the tone of the sentence is playful and mocking, which is typical of sarcastic language.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the keywords that suggest sarcasm are ""lucky for her"" and ""pruny and bug-eyed"". the phrase ""lucky for her"" is an emotional contrast, implying the opposite of what is being said. the phrase ""pruny and bug-eyed"" is a humorous and exaggerated way to describe someone, indicating sarcasm. the context of the conversation, where raj mentions giselle's underwater photo shoot as an embarrassment, also supports the sarcastic tone. the use of the word ""sadly"" at the beginning of the sentence is also ironic, adding to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'. here's why: 
         - the surface emotion expressed in the text is a mixture of sympathy (sadly) and amusement (pruny and bug-eyed), which is often a sign of sarcasm. 
         - the cultural background is american, which is known for its sarcastic humor. 
         - the punctuation used is a period, which doesn't indicate any strong emotions, but the tone is informal and conversational, typical of sarcastic language. 
         - the emotional words used are 'sadly' and 'lucky', which are used in an ironic way to convey the opposite meaning.

2. **emotional contrasts:** the emotional tone of the response contrasts with the situation, as the person is saying that the larynx is terribly inflamed, which is a serious issue, but the tone is not serious at all.

3. **rhetorical devices:** the use of hyperbole (""i've never seen anything like it"") is a rhetorical device that is often used in sarcasm to emphasize a point in a mocking or ironic way.

4. **topic:** the topic of the response is a medical issue, but it is being discussed in a way that is not serious or concerned, which is unusual and indicates sarcasm.

5. **punctuation:** there is no specific punctuation in the response that indicates sarcasm, but the tone and language used imply sarcasm.

        the cue that indicates sarcasm is the language style and tone of the response. the speaker is feigning ignorance and innocence, asking why they don't get a shot, which is an obvious and unnecessary question given the context of the conversation. the tone is playful and mocking, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. additionally, the use of the phrase ""excuse me"" at the beginning of the sentence is a common way to begin a sarcastic remark.",1.0,"sarcastic

the given dialogue is from the tv show ""the big bang theory"". the input text ""leonard: excuse me, but what about me? why don't i get a shot?"" can be classified as sarcastic. 

here's why:

* surface emotion: the tone of the sentence seems annoyed or frustrated, which can be a cue for sarcasm.
* punctuation: the use of ""excuse me"" at the beginning of the sentence can be seen as a polite phrase, but the tone and context suggest otherwise.
* common knowledge: the conversation is about raj and howard's chances with women, and leonard feels left out, which is a common theme in the show.
* keywords: the phrase ""why don't i get a shot?"" is a common phrase used in situations where someone feels overlooked or excluded, and in this context, it's used in a sarcastic tone.
* cultural background: the dialogue is from a popular tv show known for its witty banter and sarcasm, which adds to the likelihood of the sentence being sarcastic.

therefore, the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"the label for the input text is 'sarcastic'. the cues that suggest this label are the language style, which is more like a rhetorical question, and the context, where the conversation is about the guys' ability to talk to women, and leonard is seemingly excluded from the conversation. the tone of the sentence also seems a bit frustrated or annoyed, which is consistent with sarcasm. there are no special symbols or punctuation that stand out, but the topic and rhetorical devices contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        ","i would assign the label 'sarcastic'. here's my reasoning:

        * language style: the sentence is phrased in a way that is overly dramatic and exaggerated, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.
        * common knowledge: it's unlikely that someone would seriously consider leonard emotionally unstable and unfit to drive, which suggests that the speaker is being facetious.
        * cultural background: this conversation appears to be taking place in a casual, social setting, which is a common context for sarcastic remarks.
        * surface emotion: the speaker's tone appears to be playful and tongue-in-cheek, rather than genuinely concerned.
        * rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (""emotionally unstable"", ""heavy machinery"") and irony (implying that leonard is unfit to drive) are both common rhetorical devices used in sarcastic language.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the input text is sarcastic because the language style is formal and polite, but the content is actually mocking and criticizing leonard's emotional instability. the cultural background is likely to be from a western tv show, and the topic is about driving and operating heavy machinery. the emotional contrast is between the polite language and the mocking content, which suggests sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 
        the surface emotion of the text is neutral, but it contains irony and sarcasm. the special symbol ""but"" is used to contrast the expected meaning. the topic is a casual conversation between friends. the context is that the speaker was asked to drive someone to a hotel. the cultural background is american. the speaker's intention is to make a humorous comment about leonard's emotional instability, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. therefore, the label should be 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        the cues that support this classification are:

- language style: the tone of the sentence is casual and conversational, but also slightly defensive, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.
- context: the context of the conversation is a bit awkward, with penny trying to apologize for sheldon's behavior, and penny's sentence is a response to the person's accusation of being uninvited. this context suggests that penny might be using sarcasm to deflect the criticism.
- emotional words: the word ""no"" is used twice, which can indicate a sense of frustration or annoyance, which are common emotions associated with sarcasm.
- cultural background: the cultural background of the conversation is a casual, informal gathering, which is typical of many american sitcoms.
- keywords: the keywords ""oh, no, no"" at the beginning of the sentence can be seen as a sarcastic tone, implying that penny is being facetious.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the input text contains the keyword 'no' which is often used to convey a sense of negation or correction, and the tone of the sentence seems to be correcting the previous statement, which is a common trait of sarcastic language. additionally, the context of the conversation suggests that penny is trying to smooth over a misunderstanding, which may be accompanied by a hint of sarcasm. the surface emotion of the text appears to be one of mild annoyance or frustration, which is also consistent with sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        the language style used in the input text is informal and conversational. the context of the conversation is important, as it suggests that sheldon is being arrogant and leonard is responding to his attitude. the use of the phrase ""i'm so glad you asked it like that"" is a clear indication of sarcasm, as leonard is being facetious and does not actually mean what he is saying. the keyword ""so"" is also a common indicator of sarcasm, as it is often used to emphasize a point that is not actually meant to be taken seriously. additionally, the emotional tone of the input text is one of annoyance and frustration, which is also consistent with sarcasm. overall, the combination of language style, context, keywords, and emotional tone all point to the input text being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reason: 
        the cue for sarcasm in this response is the contrast between the surface emotion of gladness and the underlying emotion of annoyance. the context also helps to identify the sarcasm, as leonard's response is a reaction to sheldon's previous condescending tone. the topic of the conversation is the chancellor's award, and the keywords ""so glad"" and ""asked it like that"" are used in an ironic way to convey sarcasm. the surface emotion of the response is positive, but the tone is actually negative, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the text is sarcastic because it includes a special symbol (!), an emotional word (glad), and uses a tone that is opposite of its literal meaning. the word ""glad"" is often associated with positive emotions, but in this context, it's used to express annoyance. the tone is also informal and playful, which is characteristic of sarcastic language. additionally, the context of the conversation suggests that leonard is being facetious, as he's responding to sheldon's previous sarcastic comment.",1.0,1.0

        ### Label: 

        ","i think the correct label is 'sarcastic'. the cue i use is the emotional contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning of the sentence. the literal meaning is a genuine question, while the intended meaning is mocking and ridiculing sheldon's previous statement. this contrast indicates sarcasm.",1.0,"the cultural background is american, the emotional contrast is annoyance and confusion, the topic is the activity of walking, the surface emotion is questioning, and the special symbol is the question mark. therefore, the correct label is sarcastic.",1.0,"the input text is: ""howard: so what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?""

after analyzing the input text, i extracted the following cues:

* surface emotion: annoyance, frustration
* context: the conversation is about sheldon going for a walk, and howard is questioning his intention.
* keywords: ""walk up and down the stairs"" implies a sense of monotony and uselessness.
* topic: the topic is sheldon's walking activity.
* emotional contrast: the tone is informal and slightly aggressive, which contrasts with the initial polite tone of the conversation.

based on these cues, i assign the label: sarcastic.

the reason for this label is that howard's response is dripping with sarcasm, implying that sheldon's decision to walk up and down the stairs is ridiculous and pointless. the tone is playful, but with an underlying annoyance, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

2. rhetorical devices: the phrase ""that's very thoughtful"" is an example of irony, which is a rhetorical device often used in sarcasm. 
3. topic: the topic of sanitizing the bathroom seat is an unusual and exaggerated act of consideration, making the speaker's response more likely to be sarcastic. 
4. special symbols: there are no special symbols in this input. 
5. common knowledge: it is common knowledge that people usually don't sanitize bathroom seats for guests, so the speaker's response is likely to be sarcastic given the absurdity of the situation.",1.0,"the correct answer is 'sarcastic'. the context of the conversation implies that the person is being sarcastic when they say ""that's very thoughtful"" because sheldon's actions were not thoughtful at all, but rather eccentric and annoying. the use of the word ""thoughtful"" in this context is ironic, and the tone is one of annoyance and frustration, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,1.0

        ","sarcastic 

         reason: the use of the slang term ""bitchin'"" in a quote attributed to albert einstein is an anachronism and creates a cultural and emotional contrast between the formal language of a scientific paper and the informal, modern slang, which is a cue for sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

the context of the conversation is that sheldon is talking to his friends about a laser. the input text is sheldon's statement, which is a fictional and humorous quote attributed to albert einstein. the use of the word ""bitchin'"" is a colloquialism that is out of place in a serious scientific context, and its use is likely intended to be ironic or humorous. additionally, the idea that einstein's ""fondest hope"" was for the laser to be ""bitchin'"" is an absurdity, which further suggests sarcasm. therefore, the correct label for the input text is ""sarcastic"".",1.0,"sarcastic


        the given text is sarcastic because of the following cues:

1. **special symbols**: the use of italics in ""zur quantentheorie der"" and ""strahlung"" suggests a formal or academic tone, which contrasts with the informal word ""bitchin'"" used later.

2. **topic**: the topic of the text is a serious scientific concept (the establishment of the laser's theoretical foundation), but the tone is playful and informal.

3. **emotional words**: the word ""fondest"" implies a sense of nostalgia or warmth, which is unexpected in a scientific context.

4. **surface emotion**: the text appears to be serious and informative at first, but the use of ""bitchin'"" at the end reveals a more playful or sarcastic tone.

5. **punctuation**: there is no notable punctuation in this text that would indicate sarcasm, but the lack of punctuation marks like exclamation points or question marks adds to the sense of irony and understatement.",1.0,1.0

        the use of ""to make a long story short"" is a common phrase used to imply that what follows is not that important or is not worth telling, which is a sarcastic tone. the phrase ""unusually firm cervix"" is an unusual and awkward topic to discuss, and the way it is presented is with a casual tone, implying sarcasm. also, the use of ""anyway"" at the beginning of the sentence adds to the casual and sarcastic tone. the surface emotion of the sentence is casual, but the underlying emotion is annoyance or frustration, which is often a characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"the label is 'sarcastic'. 

        ### reason: 

        the reason is that the sentence starts with '...so anyway, to make a long story short', which is a common phrase used to downplay the importance of what is about to be said. then it follows with 'turns out i have an unusually firm cervix', which is a unexpected and unusual phrase that is not usually considered a significant or impressive trait. the contrast between the casual phrase and the unusual phrase creates an emotional contrast, implying that the speaker is being sarcastic. the language style is also casual and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic tone. the surface emotion is neutral, but the underlying emotion is likely annoyance or frustration. the cultural background of this dialogue is from the tv show 'the big bang theory', which is known for its witty and sarcastic humor. the emotional words used are 'unusually firm', which has a slightly negative connotation. all these cues suggest that the sentence is sarcastic.",1.0,"the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'. the cue is the language style, specifically the use of the phrase 'to make a long story short', which is often used in a sarcastic tone to convey annoyance or frustration. additionally, the phrase 'unusually firm cervix' is an unexpected and unusual statement, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

         - there is an emotional contrast between the literal meaning of the sentence (positive) and the intended meaning (negative).
         - the surface emotion expressed is positive, but the underlying emotion is negative and sarcastic.

 BERNADETTE: Well, what makes me the weakest member?
 AMY: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.


        ### Input:
        PENNY: Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the sentence ""of course if i buy them, i'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple"" is a clear example of sarcasm. it is an exaggeration and the use of ""of course"" in this context is ironic. it is also a ridiculous and unlikely scenario, which further indicates sarcasm. the rest of the dialogue is a conversation about being concerned about who hangs out with who, but penny's tone shifts to sarcasm when she makes the comment about renting out her womb. the use of ""of course"" and the absurdity of the statement make it clear that she is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

the given conversation is from the tv show 'the big bang theory', and the context is a discussion among friends. the cultural background is american, and the tone is informal. 

in the input text, penny is responding to amy's previous statement, which is not provided. however, based on penny's tone and language, it can be inferred that amy was being possessive or concerned about leonard's new girlfriend. 

the rhetorical devices used in the input text are irony and understatement. penny says she's not concerned, but her following statements imply the opposite. she also uses irony when she says ""of course"" in the last sentence, implying that renting her womb out to a gay couple is an absurd consequence of buying the shoes. 

the punctuation used is exclamation marks and a period, which indicates a casual and playful tone. 

the emotional contrast in the input text is between penny's nonchalant tone at the beginning and her sarcastic tone at the end. the contrast between her words and her actual emotions is what makes the text sarcastic. 

therefore, the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the response contains keywords like 'of course' which is often used to indicate sarcasm. additionally, the statement about renting her womb out to a gay couple is an obvious exaggeration and an unlikely scenario, indicating that the speaker is being facetious. the context of the conversation also suggests that penny is being sarcastic in response to amy's earlier comments about bernadette being the weakest member of the group. the tone of the sentence is also casual and playful, which is consistent with sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

        the language style of the response is formal and informative, but it's a repetition of what was just said, which makes it seem unnecessary and thus sarcastic. the cultural background is a tv show conversation, where witty and humorous responses are common, and this response fits that tone. the emotional contrast is that the situation is serious (a heart attack), but the response is dry and matter-of-fact, which adds to the sarcasm. there are no special symbols used, but the tone and language style are enough to convey sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 
        in this response, there are several cues indicating sarcasm. 

        1. rhetorical device: the phrase ""i'd like to respond to that sarcastically"" is an ironic statement, implying the opposite of what it says, which is that sheldon is actually going to respond sarcastically.

        2. surface emotion: the surface emotion is positive (relish), which contrasts with the expected negative emotion towards massages, indicating sarcasm.

        3. emotional words: the word ""relish"" has a strong positive connotation, which contrasts with the expected negative emotion, indicating sarcasm.

        4. common knowledge: it is common knowledge that people generally do not enjoy massages, especially from strangers, which makes sheldon's response ironic and sarcastic.

        5. context: the context of the conversation is about sheldon's stiff neck, and amy's suggestion of massage, which makes sheldon's response a sarcastic rejection of the idea.",1.0,1.0

         ### reasoning: 
         this text is classified as sarcastic because of the emotional contrast between the literal meaning of the sentence and the intended meaning, which is the opposite. the language style is informal and playful, with a hint of irony. the surface emotion expressed is annoyance, but the underlying emotion is humor. the keyword ""copping a feel"" is a colloquialism that implies an unwanted touch, and the situation is exaggerated for comedic effect. common knowledge suggests that it is not common for someone to touch another person's wrist in this context, adding to the sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the given text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the presence of emotional words like 'copping a feel' which implies annoyance and frustration. additionally, the use of a rhetorical device, specifically irony, as leonard is telling penny to put the corsage on amy's wrist, but leonard is saying it goes on his wrist, indicating the opposite of what is intended. this irony is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the punctuation also plays a role in conveying the sarcastic tone, with the use of a period at the end of the sentence, which adds a sense of finality and emphasizes the sarcastic remark.",1.0,1.0

        the language style used by sheldon is formal and polite, which contrasts with the ridiculousness of the situation and the content of the sentence, implying sarcasm. the phrase ""this'll just take a moment"" is also a common phrase used in a sarcastic tone. additionally, the mention of a ""five and a quarter inch floppy"" is an outdated technology, which adds to the sarcastic tone. overall, the combination of the language style, the situation, and the content of the sentence suggest that the tone is sarcastic.",1.0,"i would assign this text a label of 'sarcastic'. the cues i used to make this classification are:
         1. emotional words: the phrase 'you just got off the list' has a sarcastic tone, implying that it's not a great achievement to get off sheldon's list of mortal enemies. 
         2. language style: the sentence 'this'll just take a moment. it's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.' has a dry, matter-of-fact tone, which contrasts with the absurdity of the situation, adding to the sarcasm.
         3. context: the conversation is already established as humorous and playful, and this line fits in with that tone.
         4. emotional contrasts: the line 'you just got off the list' is delivered in a casual, almost bored tone, which contrasts with the idea of having a mortal enemy, which is typically a serious and dramatic concept.
         5. punctuation: there is no specific punctuation cue in this example, but the sentence structure and tone contribute to the overall sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

the given dialogue is sarcastic because of the following cues:

1. **emotional contrast**: sheldon's tone is opposite of what one would expect in a situation where someone is being removed from a list of enemies. instead of being relieved or grateful, he is being nonchalant and even offering to put penny back on the list.

2. **topic**: the topic of having a list of mortal enemies is already an absurd and humorous concept, which sets the tone for sarcasm.

3. **language style**: sheldon's use of formal and technical language (""five and a quarter inch floppy"") in a casual conversation adds to the sarcastic tone.

4. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion expressed is politeness and helpfulness, which contrasts with the underlying emotion of annoyance or playfulness.

5. **emotional words**: the phrase ""just take a moment"" is a polite and considerate phrase, but in this context, it's used in a sarcastic way to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.

considering these cues, the label for the input text is indeed 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

         the cue here is the topic and emotional contrast. the topic is the discussion about howard's situation and his mother, and the emotional contrast is the shift from a serious tone to a sarcastic one when sheldon speaks. the emotional contrast is evident in the tone of the sentence which is ironic and mocking, implying that howard is being hypocritical. the keywords in this case are ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself"" which has a clear ironic tone and is a common way to express sarcasm. there is no special symbol or common knowledge required to understand the sarcasm in this case. the label is therefore sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the cultural background of the conversation is that of a group of friends, probably americans, discussing a situation where one of their friends, howard, had a girl kicked out of bed. the language style is casual and humorous, with a lot of irony and sarcasm. the surface emotion is one of amusement and teasing, but there are emotional contrasts of betrayal and anger beneath the surface. the topic is the situation with howard and the girl. the response from sheldon, ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself,"" has a clear tone of sarcasm, implying that howard is being hypocritical.",1.0,1.0

        2. surface emotion: the surface emotion is positive (encouraged), but the context and tone suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic.
        
        3. emotional contrasts: the contrast between the positive surface emotion and the implied negative sentiment creates a sense of irony.
        
        4. language style: the use of formal language (""frankly, mom"") and the phrase ""willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge"" is exaggerated and overly dramatic, suggesting sarcasm.

         - cultural background: the reference to the medieval concept of a flat earth is a cultural reference that is commonly used to imply a lack of sophistication or ignorance.

        the given response is sarcastic as it uses the phrase ""nothing quite like"" to imply that something is not as impressive as it seems, and ""mildly startled"" to downplay the extent of the surprise. the tone is tongue-in-cheek and the language is playful, which are characteristic of sarcastic speech.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the language style of the input is formal, with a touch of irony, which is a common trait of sarcastic speech. the phrase ""slightly widened eyes of mildly startled"" is an exaggeration, implying that the reaction was not that significant. the use of the word ""mildly"" specifically downplays the intensity of the reaction, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. the tone is also somewhat condescending, which is another indicator of sarcasm. overall, the language style, emotional words, and tone all suggest that the input is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the label is sarcastic because the speaker, sheldon, is using irony and sarcasm when he says ""oh, of course he is"" and then proceeds to say something ridiculous about amy to imply that she is not interesting. the common knowledge cue is that it is unlikely for a 14-year-old to sever the webbing between her own toes, making the statement absurd. the surface emotion is one of mockery, and the context is a conversation about stuart's interest in amy. the topic is amy's supposed interestingness, and the emotional contrast is between the initial agreement and the subsequent ridiculous statement.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation:
        the topic of the conversation is about a guy who did some weird things to leonard. the surface emotion is playful and humorous. the cultural background is an american sitcom. the context is that sheldon is making a joke about the guy wanting to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there, which is an absurd and ridiculous idea. the rhetorical device used is hyperbole, exaggeration for comedic effect. the overall tone is playful and sarcastic. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"the label is 'sarcastic'.

        ### explanation: 

        this text is classified as 'sarcastic' because it contains a rhetorical device (irony) in the phrase 'maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.' the speaker, sheldon, is using irony to express his skepticism about the guy's intentions, implying that the guy is not genuinely interested in seeing leonard during the holidays, but rather has some other, more ridiculous reason. this irony is a clear indication of sarcasm. additionally, the use of the phrase 'the other testicle' is an emotional word that adds to the sarcastic tone. the cultural background of the tv show and the characters' personalities also provide context for understanding the sarcastic tone. sheldon's dry wit and tendency to make absurd comments are well-established characteristics, which further support the classification of this text as 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        this response is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it contains the following cues: 
        1. keywords: 'lodge the other testicle' - this phrase has a strong negative connotation and is used to mock the previous conversation.
        2. emotional words: the phrase is emotionally charged and has a strong tone of ridicule.
        3. rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (exaggeration) in 'lodge the other testicle' is a clear indication of sarcasm. 
        4. context: the conversation is already established as a humorous and playful conversation, and sheldon's response fits into that tone. 
        5. punctuation: the use of a period at the end of the sentence, rather than an exclamation mark, suggests a more deadpan tone, which is often characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        the response is 'sarcastic' because sheldon is being ironic and implying that amy wants a man with a pocket watch, not the pocket watch itself. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is opposite of the intended meaning. the use of the phrase'maybe she wants' and the context of the conversation also suggest that sheldon is being facetious.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,"the correct label for the given input is 'sarcastic'.

         here's the explanation:

         * surface emotion: the surface emotion of the input is neutral, but the tone is playful and ironic.
         * punctuation: there is no special punctuation used, but the tone of the sentence implies a smirk or a raised eyebrow.
         * common knowledge: it is common knowledge that a pocket watch is not a necessary or desirable quality in a romantic partner.
         * emotional words: there are no intense emotional words, but the word'maybe' implies a hint of sarcasm.
         * topic: the topic is a continuation of the previous conversation about finding a gift for amy, and sheldon's response is an exaggerated and humorous take on penny's previous statement.

        ### reasoning: 

        this response is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the following cues:

        1. **rhetorical device**: the response is a rhetorical question, implying that the speaker is not genuinely inquiring about penny's experience with sex but rather being facetious.

        2. **language style**: the tone of the response is informal and playful, which is often associated with sarcastic language.

        3. **surface emotion**: the response appears to be light-hearted and humorous, but beneath the surface, it may convey annoyance or frustration, which are common emotions underlying sarcastic remarks.

        4. **keywords**: the use of 'pretty great' could be seen as an understatement or an exaggeration, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.

        5. **punctuation**: no specific punctuation cues are present in this response, but the tone and language style are sufficient to indicate sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the input text is sarcastic because of the use of irony and the tone of the speaker. the phrase ""have you ever tried it?"" is particularly sarcastic, implying that penny should already know that she is having sex with leonard. the language style is also playful and teasing, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.",1.0,"to assign a correct label, i'll extract the following cues from the input text:

**keywords:** ""pretty great"" and ""have you ever tried it"" (may indicate sarcasm)

**topic:** sex and relationships (a common topic for sarcastic comments)

**punctuation:** no specific punctuation marks that stand out, but the question mark at the end of the sentence may suggest a tone of mockery.

**emotional words:** ""pretty great"" (positive sentiment, but may be used sarcastically)

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be playful or joking, but the tone may be sarcastic due to the context of the conversation.

considering these cues, i would label the input text as **sarcastic**. the response seems to be a sarcastic remark, implying that penny's question was ridiculous, and leonard is being facetious by asking if she's tried sex before. the tone is playful, but the underlying intent is to poke fun at penny's question.",1.0,1.0

        this is a sarcastic response because it contains an emotional contrast. the phrase'screw her' is aggressive and negative, but it is followed by a sentence that implies the opposite, that bernadette is lucky to hang out with them. this contrast between the two sentences implies that amy is being insincere and sarcastic. the context of the conversation also suggests that amy is being facetious, as she has been teasing penny about the painting and her 'good heart' earlier in the conversation.",1.0,"the label of this input text is 'sarcastic'. the cues are as follows:

         3. keywords: the keyword'screw' can be seen as a strong language which is often used in sarcastic tone.
         4. emotional contrasts: the contrast between the surface emotion (anger/frustration) and the actual emotion (sarcasm) is a cue for sarcasm.
         5. rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole ('we let her hang out with us') is a rhetorical device that indicates sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

         the keywords in this input are ""gift bags"", ""wine"", and ""went online"" which are usually associated with a fun night but in this context, they seem to be used in a sarcastic tone. the context of the previous conversation where howard promised a low-key night with no hanky-panky or strippers suggests that he might be downplaying the actual events of the night. the language style is casual and conversational, but the use of ""yeah"" and ""uh"" implies a hesitation or uncertainty, which can be a sign of sarcasm. the topic of the conversation is howard's night out with the boys, and the tone of the response seems to be ironic. overall, the input is labeled as sarcastic.",1.0,"the label is 'sarcastic'. 

         the cues that lead to this conclusion are:
         - surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is a mix of politeness and casualness, which is often a facade in sarcastic speech. 
         - context: the context of the conversation is howard being questioned about his night with the guys, and bernadette's response is skeptical, implying that howard might be hiding something. 
         - language style: the language style is casual and conversational, but the tone is slightly off, with an excessive use of filler words like 'uh', which can indicate insincerity. 
         - keywords: the use of the phrase'made gift bags' is an unusual activity, and the mention of going online might imply that the night was not as exciting as howard is making it out to be.
         - punctuation: there is no specific punctuation that stands out in this response, but the sentence structure is a bit awkward, which can contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,1.0

the cues that led me to this conclusion are:

- context: the conversation is about froot loops, which is a silly and unexpected topic. howard's response is a sudden shift in tone and topic, indicating sarcasm.
- emotional contrasts: howard's response is a stark contrast to the previous conversation, which was lighthearted and playful. his response is serious and somber, which is an emotional contrast that suggests sarcasm.
- emotional words: the phrase ""let my life flash before my eyes"" is an exaggeration and a hyperbole, which is a common feature of sarcastic language.
- topic: the topic of the conversation suddenly shifts from froot loops to howard's supposed despair, which is an unexpected and absurd topic shift.
- language style: howard's response is formal and serious, which is a departure from the playful and casual tone of the previous conversation. this shift in language style suggests sarcasm.",1.0,"i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. here's why:
         - punctuation: the use of a period after 'not exactly' creates a sense of finality and irony, which is a common trait of sarcastic tone.
         - emotional contrasts: the contrast between the initial reluctance to chat and the exaggerated phrase 'let my life flash before my eyes' suggests a sarcastic tone.
         - surface emotion: the surface emotion of reluctance and frustration is amplified by the use of hyperbole, implying sarcasm.
         - language style: the use of a dry, matter-of-fact tone ('not exactly') followed by an absurd and melodramatic statement ('let my life flash before my eyes') is characteristic of sarcastic language.

         here's why:

         - the keyword 'boom-boom' is used in a context where it's not relevant, which is a cue for sarcasm.
         - the topic of the conversation is the nobel prize, and the speaker is making a joke about something unrelated to the topic, which is a cue for sarcasm.
         - the use of the phrase'making boom-boom in the potty' is a rhetorical device, as it's an exaggeration and a childish way to refer to using the bathroom, which is a cue for sarcasm.
         - the tone of the sentence is playful and mocking, which is a cue for sarcasm.
         - the common knowledge is that the nobel prize is a prestigious award given for outstanding contributions in a particular field, and the speaker is making a joke about it being given for something silly, which is a cue for sarcasm.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,1.0

**language style:** the language style is casual and conversational, with a hint of humor and irony.

**punctuation:** the use of ""yeah, well"" at the beginning of the sentence creates a sense of hesitation or reluctance, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

based on these cues, i would label the input text as **sarcastic**. the phrase ""under my dentist"" is an obvious exaggeration and is likely meant to be humorous, but also conveys a sense of frustration or annoyance. the tone is playful and lighthearted, but with a hint of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the label is 'sarcastic' because the mention of 'ben and jerry', which is an ice cream brand, is an obvious exaggeration and a humorous way to imply that ice cream was a way to cheer his mom up, rather than a genuine statement. this language style is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reason: 

        the cue for sarcasm in this response is the mention of ben and jerry, which is a brand of ice cream. this is an example of special symbols or brand names being used to convey sarcasm. the phrase ""me and ben and jerry"" implies that the speaker is being facetious about being able to cheer their mother up, as it's unlikely that a brand of ice cream would be able to do so. the tone is playful and ironic, indicating sarcasm.",1.0,"the label for the given input is 'sarcastic'. 

         the cues that lead to this classification are: 
         1. rhetorical devices: the use of irony in the sentence ""yeah, i was the only person who could cheer her up."" is a clear indication of sarcasm. 
         2. language style: the casual tone and the use of colloquial language (""yeah"") contribute to the sarcastic tone. 
         3. cultural background: the reference to ben and jerry, a popular ice cream brand, is a common cultural reference that is often used in a humorous or ironic way. 
         4. punctuation: the use of a period after ""up"" and the comma after ""yeah"" creates a pause, which adds to the sarcastic tone. 
         5. surface emotion: the sentence appears to be expressing a positive sentiment, but the underlying tone is actually negative and sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        rhetorical devices: raj's response is sarcastic because he is using irony and understatement. he is being facetious when he says that the 'guy at the liquor store' is a professional who can provide help. the comment about the liquor tasting great in coffee is also an exaggeration and a non-sequitur, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

         so, the correct label is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### reasoning: 

         the response is sarcastic because it includes the following cues:

         * emotional words: ""really"" and ""forward"" are used in a way that is opposite of their literal meaning, implying the opposite of enthusiasm.
         * common knowledge: it's common knowledge that being alone on valentine's day can be unpleasant, and the speaker's response is implying that being in the current situation is not desirable.
         * punctuation: the tone of the sentence is conveyed through the use of irony, which is often indicated by a tone that is opposite of the literal meaning.
         * surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is one of excitement and enthusiasm, but it's clear that the speaker is being facetious.
         * rhetorical devices: the use of irony and understatement are rhetorical devices that indicate sarcasm.

         overall, the speaker's response is the opposite of what they truly mean, making it a sarcastic comment.",1.0,"the correct answer is: sarcastic. 

        ### explanation: 

        the cue that suggests sarcasm in this response is the speaker's use of irony and rhetorical devices. the speaker says they're ""really looking forward to it"" and that ""there's no place [they] would rather be than here"", which is a clear exaggeration and the opposite of what they truly mean. this irony and exaggeration are characteristic of sarcastic language. additionally, the context of the conversation, which is about being lonely on valentine's day, also suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

         the cues for this label are: 

         * surface emotion: the speaker expresses gratitude, but the tone is opposite, which is annoyance. 
         * special symbols: the use of quotation marks around the phrase ""20-minute lecture"" is a hint that the speaker is being facetious.

         * cultural background: the context is informal and conversational, where sarcasm is more common.

        the explanation for the label is: the input text contains emotional contrasts (gratitude and annoyance), rhetorical devices (exaggeration - ""20-minute lecture""), and keywords (sarcasm indicators like ""thank you"" and irony in the phrase ""why monster trucks are better than regular trucks""). the tone is informal and playful, but the language used is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the label is sarcastic because the use of the word ""liar"" is a rhetorical device used to emphasize the speaker's (raj) disapproval of howard's dishonesty. the phrase ""you big liar"" is a clear exaggeration, which is another rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm. additionally, the context of the conversation, where howard is trying to hide something from raj, adds to the sarcastic tone of raj's response.",1.0,"sarcastic

        3. common knowledge: it is unlikely that penny would genuinely suggest tearing off sheldon's clothes and engaging in intimate activities in a public setting, which is an absurd scenario.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","the correct label is: sarcastic 

        reason: the cue here is the context and the topic. the conversation is about comic-con and the disappointment of not being able to attend. the speaker's statement about wasting time on hulk costumes is a clear exaggeration, implying that they didn't really waste time and are being sarcastic about it. the tone is playful and mocking, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to the input text. 

         the cues that support this classification are:

         * the keyword ""wasted"" has a negative connotation, indicating frustration and disappointment.
         * the phrase ""all that time"" is an exaggeration, implying that the time spent on the costumes was not worth it.
         * the use of ""i can't believe"" is a rhetorical device, implying that the speaker is being facetious and does not actually believe that the time was wasted.
         * the context of the conversation, where penny has just expressed sadness about something, and sheldon's response is a sarcastic comment about the costumes, further supports the classification.

         these cues collectively suggest that the tone of the input text is sarcastic.",1.0,"the correct label for this input is 'sarcastic'. the cues that indicate sarcasm are:
        1. surface emotion: the tone of the sentence is one of disappointment and frustration, which is the opposite of what one would expect from someone who has wasted time on a costume.
        2. cultural background: the reference to the hulk costumes and the context of attending a comic-con (wondercon) implies a geeky or nerdy cultural background, where costumes are a big deal.
        3. language style: the use of the phrase ""i can't believe"" is a common idiomatic expression used to convey sarcasm.
        4. special symbols: none in this case.
        5. rhetorical devices: the sentence uses irony and understatement to convey the opposite meaning of what is being said. the speaker is actually disappointed and frustrated that they wasted time on the costumes, but is saying the opposite.",1.0,1.0

         - surface emotion: the surface emotion of the sentence seems to be neutral or slightly annoyed. 
         - language style: the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic tone. 
         - emotional words: the word ""what"" can be seen as a slight emotional cue, as it implies a tone of incredulity.

- common knowledge: the conversation is about a murder mystery dinner party, where people are pretending to be dead or suspects. this context is not a common, everyday scenario, which suggests that the person's question might be rhetorical and sarcastic.
- topic: the topic is a murder mystery dinner party, which is a playful and fictional setting. the person's question seems out of place in this context, implying sarcasm.
- cultural background: the conversation is informal and playful, which is consistent with a casual dinner party setting. however, the person's question seems to be a departure from the lighthearted tone, suggesting sarcasm.
- surface emotion: the surface emotion of the question is annoyance or frustration, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.
- punctuation: there is no punctuation in the input text, but if it were written with a question mark, it would likely be a rhetorical question, which is often a sign of sarcasm.

        2. topic: the topic of the sentence is sheldon's struggle to find a new area of focus, but the tone and language used suggest that sheldon is being facetious.

        3. language style: the use of overly formal language (""in your professional opinion"") and the phrase ""most promising"" are indicators of sarcasm.

        the topic of the conversation is about sheldon's behavior. the punctuation used in the sentence is a period, which doesn't indicate any strong emotions. the surface emotion of the sentence is neutral. the keywords that suggest sarcasm are ""exciting opportunities"" which is an obvious exaggeration and irony. the common knowledge is that home care for the old and fat is not an exciting opportunity, which further reinforces the sarcasm. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"the label for the given input is 'sarcastic'.

        explanation: 
        the context provides a background for the conversation where sheldon is being rude and making outrageous statements. the input text by howard seems to be a response to sheldon's statement about leaving the university. the cues extracted from the input are:
        1. rhetorical devices: howard's statement is a form of irony, as he is suggesting a ridiculous job opportunity to sheldon, implying that he is not qualified for anything better.
        2. context: the conversation is already set in a tone of sarcasm and ridicule, which influences the interpretation of howard's statement.
        3. keywords: the words ""exciting opportunities"" are used in a sarcastic tone, implying that the job is not exciting at all.
        4. emotional words: the word ""fat"" is used to emphasize the ridiculousness of the job opportunity.
        5. common knowledge: it is common knowledge that working in home care for the old and fat is not a prestigious or desirable job, which adds to the sarcastic tone of the statement.

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

         explanation: 
         the response is sarcastic because of the emotional contrast between the words and the tone. the words are romantic and optimistic, but the tone is clearly annoyed and frustrated. additionally, the phrase ""do you hear yourself, woman?!"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, as it is an exaggerated and condescending way to address someone. the cultural background and common knowledge of romantic relationships also play a role in recognizing the sarcasm, as the proposal and settling down are typically seen as positive and desirable, but in this context, they are being used in a mocking way. the keywords ""engaged"", ""house"", ""family"", and ""sunset years"" also contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning:
        the text exhibits sarcasm through the use of hyperbole and irony. the speaker, sheldon, is being facetious when he suggests getting engaged, starting a family, and enjoying their sunset years together, implying that these are absurd and impossible outcomes given the context of the conversation. the use of rhetorical questions (""do you hear yourself, woman?!"") also adds to the sarcastic tone. overall, the emotional contrast between the speaker's words and their intended meaning, as well as the exaggeration and irony, indicate that the text is sarcastic.",1.0,"label: sarcastic 

        the given dialogue is sarcastic because of the following cues:

1. **keywords**: words like 'oh, sure' and 'why don't we' are often used in a sarcastic tone to convey the opposite of what they literally mean.

2. **topic**: the topic is a proposal of engagement and family, which is an exaggerated and unlikely scenario given the context of the conversation.

3. **surface emotion**: the tone of the dialogue is aggressive and annoyed, which is a common surface emotion associated with sarcasm.

4. **punctuation**: the use of exclamation marks and question marks adds to the emotional intensity and rhetorical nature of the dialogue, which is typical of sarcastic speech.

5. **cultural background**: in western cultures, proposals of engagement and family are typically associated with romantic and emotional conversations, making the sarcastic tone more apparent.",1.0,1.0

        the use of emotional contrast and rhetorical device are the primary cues in this statement. the phrase ""that's how much"" is a rhetorical device that implies a strong emotional connection. however, the context and the previous conversation imply that howard was lying about going to the comic book store with his father, making his statement ironic and sarcastic. the emotional contrast between the expected sincerity and the actual insincerity is what makes this statement sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

the input text contains sarcasm as it implies that the man who could bed both penny and emily is not worthy, despite raj's initial compliment. the cues that indicate sarcasm are:

1. common knowledge: the conversation is about penny and raj's past, and penny's current engagement to leonard.
2. special symbols: none
3. surface emotion: the text appears to be a compliment, but the tone is actually negative.
4. keywords: ""kind of says something about the man"" is a phrase that implies a negative judgment.
5. punctuation: the use of ""--"" and ""-"" indicates a tone of sarcasm.

therefore, the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'. here's why:

         - context: the conversation is about penny's past relationships and her current engagement with leonard. raj's statement is an unexpected twist, which indicates sarcasm.

         - emotional words: the word 'gorgeous' is used in an ironic way to convey a sense of annoyance or frustration rather than genuine admiration.

         - common knowledge: the phrase'says something about the man who could bed you both' is a backhanded compliment, implying that raj is criticizing penny's taste in men rather than genuinely praising her.

         - punctuation: the use of '--' (em dash) in the sentence creates a sense of separation between the two clauses, emphasizing the contrast between the surface-level compliment and the underlying criticism.

         - special symbols: there are no special symbols in this input text.

        2. rhetorical device: the use of irony and understatement in the sentence implies sarcasm. 

        3. common knowledge: the context of the conversation suggests that penny and raj have a complicated past, and raj's comment is likely meant to be hurtful rather than genuinely complimentary.

         explanation: the sentence is sarcastic because it uses emotional contrasts and context. penny's statement seems positive on the surface (""maybe it's a good thing""), but the phrase ""what not to do"" implies a negative evaluation, which is a contrast to the initial positive tone. the context of the conversation, where leonard shares his past experience of being emasculated by his mother, suggests that penny is being sarcastic about their current situation. the use of ""maybe"" also softens the tone, implying that penny is being facetious.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 
        the sentence 'maybe it's a good thing we came here' has a positive tone, but it is followed by 'it's like a lesson in what not to do', which has a negative tone. this contrast between the two clauses suggests that penny is being sarcastic. the word 'lesson' also implies a sense of irony, as the situation is not a positive or desirable one.",1.0,1.0

        ### reasoning: 

        the response from penny is a clear example of sarcasm. the context of the conversation is about the shame in one-celled organisms, and penny's response is an absurd and humorous example of what a one-celled organism might be embarrassed about, implying that it's ridiculous to consider shame in such organisms. the use of ""same as all of us"" and the ridiculous scenario of getting out of a car without underwear adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 

        in this response, the cue for sarcasm is the topic shift. the conversation was initially about a scientific topic (one-celled organisms), and penny's response is unrelated and humorous, implying that the initial topic is not important. the use of ""same as all of us"" is also a rhetorical device, downplaying the importance of the initial topic and implying that it's not a big deal. additionally, the topic of getting out of a car without underwear is an unexpected and humorous twist, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic responses.",1.0,"the label for this input is 'sarcastic'. 

here's why: 
1. emotional words:'same' and 'all of us' imply a sense of shared experience, but 'getting out of a car without underwear' is an unexpected and embarrassing situation, which contradicts the initial tone of shared normalcy.
2. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the sentence is casual and conversational, but the content is absurd and uncomfortable, creating a sense of irony.
3. rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (exaggeration) in'same as all of us' and the unexpected twist in the second part of the sentence create a sense of surprise and irony, which are characteristic of sarcasm.
4. language style: the use of a conversational tone and a relatable phrase ('same as all of us') creates a sense of familiarity, which is then subverted by the absurdity of the second part of the sentence.
5. cultural background: the reference to getting out of a car without underwear is a culturally specific and relatable scenario, which adds to the humor and irony of the sentence.",1.0,1.0

         reason: the speaker, sheldon, is using the phrase ""it's good to have a few in the bank"" which is a common idiomatic expression used to convey the idea of saving something for future use. however, in this context, it's being used in a sarcastic tone to imply that penny is not responding quickly enough, and sheldon is being facetious about needing to ""save up"" her responses for future conversations. the use of this phrase in a situation where it doesn't literally apply, and the tone of the sentence, suggest that sheldon is being sarcastic. additionally, the context of the conversation, where penny is slow to respond, and sheldon's repeated attempts to get her attention, also support the interpretation that sheldon's comment is sarcastic.",1.0,"the correct label is: sarcastic

         the reason is that the sentence is spoken by sheldon, who is known for his sarcastic tone in the tv show. the sentence itself is also phrased in a way that implies annoyance and frustration, with the use of the phrase ""next time"" and the idea of having a few ""in the bank"", which is an unusual phrase that implies he's trying to prepare for some future annoyance. the tone of the sentence is also somewhat passive-aggressive, which is another indicator of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        common knowledge: in a romantic relationship, it is generally expected that both partners contribute to household chores and responsibilities.

        emotional contrasts: bernadette's statement is phrased as a positive sentiment, but the context and tone suggest that she is actually expressing frustration or annoyance that howard does not do his share of the household work. the contrast between the surface emotion and the implied emotion is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 
        the context is about raj's parents getting divorced, and the conversation seems to be serious. however, sheldon makes an off-topic comment about hiring a lawyer. penny's response, ""good job, sheldon,"" is sarcastic because she's being facetious and ironic. the surface emotion is positive (praising sheldon), but the emotional contrast is that the situation is actually negative (raj's parents getting divorced), and penny is mocking sheldon's off-topic comment. this sarcasm is also dependent on common knowledge that making an off-topic comment in a serious conversation is not a ""good job.""",1.0,"sarcastic

         ### reason: 
         the topic is about raj's parents and their divorce, but sheldon suddenly changes the subject to she-hulk. penny's comment ""you know what? that was almost on topic"" implies that sheldon's previous comment was not relevant to the conversation. the context is that sheldon's comment was not on topic and penny's comment is an ironic appreciation for sheldon's attempt to be relevant. the rhetorical device used is irony, and the common knowledge is that sheldon often goes off topic in conversations. the emotional contrast is between the seriousness of raj's situation and the non-sequitur comment made by sheldon. overall, the label 'sarcastic' is assigned because penny's comment is an ironic appreciation of sheldon's off-topic comment.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### explanation: 
        the label for this input is 'sarcastic' because of the presence of the phrase ""good job, sheldon"" which is an obvious exaggeration and irony, implying the opposite of what is being said. the context also plays a role here, as sheldon's previous statement was off-topic, which makes penny's response a sarcastic remark.",1.0,1.0

        the context and language style are formal and intellectual, with a discussion on the importance of idea and execution. however, sheldon's response is a perfect example of sarcasm. the surface emotion is mocking, with the use of irony and hyperbole. the keywords are ""good for you"", ""lovely little notion"", and ""you just got burned"", which convey a sense of condescension and ridicule. the emotional words are ""burned"", which implies a sense of embarrassment or shame. overall, the tone is clearly sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 
        in this dialogue, sheldon's response is sarcastic because it includes emotional contrast (good for you, leonard -> you just got burned), a rhetorical device (exaggerated example - inventing the telephone), and a keyword (burned, implying that leonard was roasted). the contrast between the initial positive tone and the sudden shift to mocking leonard's idea, along with the use of a humorous and absurd example, clearly indicate sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

         3. common knowledge: the biblical story of the israelites wandering in the desert for 40 years is common knowledge.

         5. rhetorical devices: hyperbole (exaggeration) is used when howard says ""walk it off"" implying that the food was so much that it would take 40 years to burn off the calories. this is an obvious exaggeration and is meant to be humorous.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the given response is sarcastic because it uses a rhetorical device of irony. the speaker is implying that the 40 years of wandering in the desert was because of eating too much, which is an absurd explanation. the use of'my people' also adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that howard is jewish and making a humorous connection to the biblical story. the sentence structure and word choice also contribute to the sarcastic tone, with the phrase 'walk it off' being a common idiomatic expression used in a humorous way.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the given response is classified as sarcastic because it uses emotional contrast, which is a common cue for sarcasm. the phrase ""it's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years"" seems serious and historical, but the following phrase ""took that long to walk it off"" is humorous and ironic, implying that the reason for wandering the desert was to lose weight, which is an unexpected and ridiculous reason. this contrast between the serious setup and the humorous punchline indicates sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

here's the reasoning behind the label:

2. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion of the sentence appears to be one of warning or concern, but...

3. **punctuation**: the use of ""buckle up"" is a colloquialism that often implies excitement or anticipation, which contrasts with the supposed ""cranky night"" ahead. the semicolon also adds a hint of irony.

4. **language style**: sheldon's response is characteristic of his dry, witty, and slightly condescending tone.

5. **emotional words**: ""cranky"" is a word that has a somewhat playful connotation, which doesn't quite match the supposed seriousness of the warning. this mismatch adds to the sarcastic tone.

        ### explanation: 
        the keyword ""just"" can be an indicator of sarcasm, implying that the action is ridiculously easy or obvious. the phrase ""pop it like a zit"" is also an unusual and unexpected way to describe drinking a cocktail, which can be seen as an exaggeration and a characteristic of sarcasm. the tone of the response is playful and lighthearted, but the language used is absurd and mocking, which are common features of sarcastic language. overall, the language style and tone of the response suggest that howard is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reason: 

        the cue used to identify sarcasm in this input is the language style and emotional contrasts. the phrase ""pop it like a zit"" is an unusual and unpleasant way to describe drinking a cocktail, and the tone is informal and playful. the use of a comparison to a bodily function (popping a zit) adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the action of drinking the cocktail is not as sophisticated as it seems. the emotional contrast between the expected elegance of a molecular cocktail and the crude comparison to a zit also suggests sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the response contains cues that indicate sarcasm. 
        1. language style: the language used is casual, informal, and playful, which is often associated with sarcasm. the phrase ""pop it like a zit"" is an unexpected and humorous way to describe drinking a cocktail, which adds to the sarcastic tone.
        2. emotional words: the use of the word ""zit"" has a negative connotation, implying that the action of drinking the cocktail is unpleasant or annoying, which is a sarcastic sentiment.
        3. surface emotion: the tone of the response appears to be playful and lighthearted, but the underlying emotion is one of annoyance or frustration, which is characteristic of sarcasm.
        4. common knowledge: it is common knowledge that you don't typically ""pop"" a zit, and the comparison is absurd, which adds to the sarcastic tone.
        5. punctuation: there is no specific punctuation that indicates sarcasm in this response, but the tone and language used convey a sarcastic attitude.",1.0,1.0

         4. context: the conversation's context, where penny is asking a genuine question and leonard responds with an absurd answer, suggests that he's being sarcastic.

        the cues that lead to this classification are:

        5. **rhetorical devices**: the use of repetition (""oh oh oh"") and irony (describing the woman as a ""business woman"" before revealing she's naked) are rhetorical devices that suggest sarcasm.

the given response contains sarcasm because it is a rhetorical question. chandler is implying that it is highly unlikely that the person in question will be able to crack the code, and is using the question to express his skepticism and doubt. the tone of the response is also somewhat mocking and incredulous, which further suggests that it is meant to be sarcastic.",1.0,"after analyzing the given text, i identified the following cues:
         1. rhetorical devices: there is a hint of irony in the question, as chandler is probably not expecting the person to crack the code, but rather expressing skepticism.
         2. topic: the topic is about someone's ability to crack a code, which is a fairly serious topic, but chandler's tone is casual and dismissive.
         3. emotional contrasts: there is a contrast between the seriousness of the topic and chandler's nonchalant attitude, which creates a sense of irony.
         4. language style: the language used is informal and conversational, with a touch of sarcasm.
         5. surface emotion: the surface emotion is skepticism, but beneath that, there is a sense of amusement and playfulness.

         based on these cues, i assign the label: sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

1. cultural background: the dialogue is from a popular american sitcom, friends, and sarcasm is a common language device used in the show.

2. topic: the topic is trying to open something with a coat hangar, and chandler's response is an obstruction to the task at hand, which is a common setup for sarcasm.

3. surface emotion: chandler's tone is calm and casual, but his words convey a sense of annoyance and frustration, which is a typical surface emotion for sarcastic remarks.

4. context: the context is a conversation between friends, and chandler's response is a reaction to joey's request, which provides a setup for a witty and sarcastic comment.

5. rhetorical devices: chandler's response uses irony and understatement (""oh i do. oh no, wait a minute..."") to convey the opposite of what he literally means, which is a classic characteristic of sarcasm.

        3. **emotional contrasts**: the tone of chandler's response is dry and unenthusiastic, which contrasts with the expected tone of excitement or willingness to help.
        4. **special symbols**: none in this case.
        5. **language style**: chandler's response has a tongue-in-cheek tone, which is typical of sarcastic language. the use of ""oh no, wait a minute"" also implies a sense of fake realization, adding to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

         the sentence is sarcastic because it uses irony and emotional contrast. the phrase ""that crying indian"" is a reference to the famous anti-littering commercial from the 1970s, which is a nostalgic and serious topic. however, chandler uses it in a casual and flippant way, implying that he doesn't care about littering and is being facetious about the consequences. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. additionally, the use of the word ""save us"" is an exaggeration and adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the reasoning behind the labeling is the usage of emotional contrast and rhetorical devices. the emotional contrast is observed between the expected behavior (using the trash can) and the actual behavior (littering). the rhetorical device used is irony, as chandler is making a humorous comment about the famous ""crying indian"" anti-pollution advertisement, implying that the only reason to litter is to summon the indian to clean up the mess, which is an absurd scenario. these cues suggest that chandler's statement is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ","this conversation is sarcastic. the label is 'sarcastic'.

here's why:
1. emotional words: 'dufus' is a derogatory term which implies mockery and sarcasm.
2. punctuation: the exclamation mark '!' after 'huh' indicates strong emotions, which in this case is likely annoyance or frustration.
3. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the sentence appears to be confusion, but the tone is actually sarcastic.
4. rhetorical devices: the use of 'dufus' is a form of irony and mockery, which is a common device used in sarcasm.
5. emotional contrasts: the contrast between the surface emotion of confusion and the underlying tone of sarcasm also indicates that the sentence is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         reason: 
         the language style used by monica is informal and playful, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the topic of the conversation is also lighthearted and humorous. the keywords ""dufus"" and ""speled"" are intentionally misspelled to convey a sense of mockery. the context of the conversation, where monica is responding to joey's previous statement about ""pleh"" being ""help"" spelled backwards, suggests that monica is being facetious. the use of ""huh!"" at the beginning of the sentence adds a tone of surprise and incredulity, which is also typical of sarcastic language. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that monica's statement is sarcastic.",1.0,"i would label this input as 'sarcastic'. the surface emotion of the input is confusion or questioning, but the use of the word ""dufus"" which is a playful and informal term for a foolish person, suggests a sense of mocking or teasing, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the emotional contrast between the surface emotion of confusion and the underlying tone of mockery also supports the sarcastic label. additionally, the use of a rhetorical question (""whats dufus speled backwards?"") and the playful spelling of ""speled"" instead of ""spelled"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone. the punctuation, specifically the use of an exclamation mark, also adds to the playful and sarcastic tone. the keyword ""dufus"" is a strong indicator of sarcasm in this context.",1.0,1.0

        the cues i extracted are:

1. emotional contrast: the tone of the response seems to be dismissive, but the context of the conversation is about rachel's concern for chandler's smoking habit, which is a serious topic. the contrast between the casual tone and the serious topic suggests sarcasm.

2. language style: the use of ""nope"" instead of a more formal ""no"" or ""i don't think so"" creates a casual tone that might be interpreted as sarcastic.

3. topic: the topic of the conversation is about quitting smoking, which is a serious issue. chandler's response downplays the effectiveness of the patch, which could be seen as sarcastic.

4. punctuation: there is no special punctuation in this response that would indicate sarcasm.

5. rhetorical devices: chandler's response could be interpreted as irony or understatement, which are both rhetorical devices often used to convey sarcasm.

the extracted cues suggest that the response is sarcastic, so the label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"the label is: sarcastic. 

         the explanation for the label is: 
         - the language style used is informal, with a negative tone (nope) which indicates a dismissive attitude, which is a common trait of sarcasm.
         - there is a contrast between the expectation (rachel bringing something to help chandler quit smoking) and the reality (chandler rejecting the patch), which creates an emotional contrast, another cue for sarcasm.

        ### explanation: 

        the sentence contains a clear example of sarcasm. ""ha ha"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm and irony. the phrase ""you the worst best man ever"" is an exaggeration and an obvious overstatement, which is another indicator of sarcasm. the use of ""oh just give a minute to wake up for this"" is also a sign of annoyance and frustration, which contrasts with the surface level of amusement and playfulness expressed through ""ha ha"". this contrast between the surface level emotion and the underlying emotion is a key feature of sarcasm.",1.0,sarcastic,1.0,"sarcastic

the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because it exhibits several cues indicative of sarcasm:

1. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""you the worst best man ever!"" is an example of irony, as chandler is being facetious about joey's abilities as a best man.

2. **language style**: the tone of the response is informal and playful, with a hint of mockery, which is typical of sarcastic language.

3. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion expressed is amusement, indicated by the ""ha ha!"", but this is contrasted with the underlying annoyance and frustration with joey's incompetence.

4. **special symbols**: the use of ellipses (...) may indicate a pause or a trailing off, which can contribute to the sarcastic tone.

5. **emotional contrasts**: the contrast between the initial annoyance (""oh just give a minute to wake up for this"") and the subsequent amusement (""ha ha!"") creates an emotional contrast that is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

        the reason behind this label is that chandler is making a sarcastic comment about joey's hernia. joey previously mentioned that he will start with laser eye surgery, not that it will fix his hernia. chandler is implying that laser eye surgery is not relevant to fixing a hernia, which is a ridiculous statement, hence the sarcasm. this is an example of emotional contrast, where chandler is saying the opposite of what he means to be funny.",1.0,"'sarcastic' 

        ### reasoning: 

        this text is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the language style, which is ironic and humorous. the topic is about joey's hernia, which is a serious issue, but the speaker is making a joke about it by saying that laser eye surgery will fix it, which is not related to the actual problem. the emotional contrast between the serious topic and the humorous tone also indicates sarcasm.",1.0,"i will assign a label of 'sarcastic'. 

         the topic is joey's health issue.

rhetorical devices: the use of understatement ('some might find it amusing') and irony ('i myself find it regular') are clear indications of sarcasm.

         in this dialogue, chandler's response seems out of place and unrelated to the conversation, which suggests sarcasm. his use of overly formal language, such as ""you see king george is giving us the land, so"" also indicates that he's being facetious. the context of the conversation, where rachel asks ""settle what?"" and chandler responds with a random historical fact, further supports the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"i would label this text as 'sarcastic'. the language style is informal and playful, with chandler using a somewhat ridiculous and unexpected topic (the jamestown colony of virginia) to respond to rachel's question, indicating a sarcastic tone. there is also an emotional contrast between the expected response to rachel's question and chandler's non-sequitur reply. the surface emotion is one of dry humor, and the use of the phrase ""you see king george is giving us the land, so"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

         explanation: 
         the cue for sarcasm lies in the language style of the sentence, which is an exclamation of surprise and shock, but the situation described is not alarming or surprising at all. this is an example of irony, a rhetorical device often used in sarcasm. chandler's tone is clearly sarcastic as he is making a comparison between a parachute and a knapsack, which are two completely different objects with different purposes. this is a clear indication of sarcasm.",1.0,"the label for the input text is 'sarcastic'. the cues that lead to this label are:
         1. emotional words: 'dear god' is an emotional phrase that is often used to express frustration, annoyance, or sarcasm.
         2. language style: the sentence structure and tone of the sentence are informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic remarks.
         3. special symbols: the use of 'god' with a capital 'g' adds emphasis and drama to the sentence, which is often a characteristic of sarcastic language.
         4. topic: the topic of the sentence is unexpected and absurd, which is a common trait of sarcastic comments.
         5. punctuation: the use of a comma after 'dear god' creates a pause and adds to the dramatic effect, which is typical of sarcastic language.

         therefore, based on these cues, the input text is labeled as 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input. the language style is informal and conversational, with a touch of irony and hyperbole ('dear god'). the context is not provided, but the sentence appears to be a humorous comment on the parachute. the punctuation is an exclamation mark, which adds to the sense of irony. the cultural background is american, and the surface emotion is annoyance or frustration. overall, the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is typical of sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

        the given response is classified as sarcastic because of the following cues: 
1. punctuation: the use of ""oh yeah ok"" with a comma indicates a sense of annoyance or frustration, which is a common trait of sarcastic tone.
2. surface emotion: the tone of the response appears to be playful, but the context and the words used suggest annoyance and frustration, which is a typical characteristic of sarcasm.
3. emotional words: the use of ""yeah"" and ""ok"" with a tone of annoyance and frustration implies that the speaker is being facetious.

5. special symbols: none used in this response.",1.0,"the correct answer is: sarcastic

        the reason is that chandler's response is a hyperbole (exaggeration) - seventeen zillion dollars is an impossible amount, indicating that he is being facetious. the context of the conversation and the surface emotion of chandler's response (a tone of annoyance or frustration) also support this interpretation.",1.0,the correct label is: sarcastic.,1.0,1.0

* topic: the topic is a person (julie), and the conversation is about missing her, but chandler's response takes it in a ridiculous direction.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is amusement and playfulness, which can be a sign of sarcasm.
* cultural background: the reference to ""spanish midgets wrestling"" is a culturally specific and somewhat taboo topic, which adds to the absurdity and irony of the statement, making it more likely to be sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        the label is sarcastic because the response is dripping with sarcasm. the use of ""well"" at the beginning, the phrase ""slow me down at first"", and the phrase ""get back on track"" are all indicators of sarcasm. the language style is also informal and casual, which is typical of sarcastic responses. additionally, the use of the phrase ""extra weight"" is a clear exaggeration and is meant to be humorous, which is another indicator of sarcasm. overall, the tone of the response is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,"the correct label for the input is 'sarcastic'. the cues that lead to this conclusion are:
         * emotional contrast: the phrase ""it will probably slow me down at first"" sounds like a negative statement, but it is immediately followed by ""but once i am used to the extra weight, i ll get back on track"", which implies that the initial effect is not a problem. this contrast between the initial negative tone and the subsequent positive tone is a common trait of sarcasm.
         * context: the conversation is about chandler wearing a bracelet, which is an unusual or unmanly thing to do, and chandler's response is a tongue-in-cheek comment about the potential impact on his sex life. this context suggests that chandler is being sarcastic.
         * surface emotion: the surface emotion of the statement is a mix of irony and humor, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. the use of the phrase ""i ll get back on track"" implies a sense of mock seriousness, which is also a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

         the input text is a response to joey's statement, and chandler's response is a clear example of sarcasm. the cue is in the language style, specifically the use of ""i think"" which is often used to express irony or sarcasm. additionally, the phrase ""probably why"" is also a giveaway, as it implies that chandler doesn't actually believe what he's saying. the topic of the conversation is also a clue, as it's about smoking in a cell, which is an unusual and humorous context. the emotional contrast is also present, as chandler's response is a clever and witty comeback, which is a characteristic of sarcastic tone. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the input text is indeed sarcastic.",1.0,"the correct label for the input text is: sarcastic

         the cues that led to this classification are: 
         1. topic: the topic is related to smoking in a cell, which is a ridiculous situation.

         3. punctuation: no specific punctuation is used, but the tone of the sentence implies sarcasm.
         4. rhetorical devices: chandler's statement is an example of irony and understatement.
         5. surface emotion: the surface emotion is a dry, witty tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"the correct answer is 'sarcastic'. this response is a sarcastic remark because it implies that the reason damone smokes in his cell alone is not because of the same reason as joey, which is to smoke freely, but probably because he is not welcome to smoke with others due to his unpleasant behavior. the tone is playful and mocking. the cultural background of the tv show ""friends"" and the character chandler's personality also suggest that this is a sarcastic remark.",1.0,1.0

1. emotional contrast: the text expresses irony and mocking, which is the opposite of the expected positive or neutral tone.

2. context: the previous conversation is about joey becoming an actor/model, and chandler's response is a witty and humorous remark that downplays joey's new profession.

3. punctuation: the use of ""so funny"" with a sarcastic tone is often accompanied by irony or mocking, which is reinforced by the rest of the sentence.

4. language style: chandler's response is a clever play on words, using the phrase ""man slash woman"" to mock joey's new profession.

5. surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is humor or amusement, but the underlying tone is sarcastic and mocking.

considering these cues, the correct label for the input text is ""sarcastic"".",1.0,"the correct label is: sarcastic.

         explanation: 
         the cue here is the language style, specifically the tone. chandler's response is dripping with sarcasm, as he is making fun of joey's attempt to sound cool. the phrase ""that's so funny"" is often used to express irony or sarcasm, and the way chandler says ""joey tribbiani man slash woman"" is a clear mocking of joey's original statement. the use of the word ""slash"" is also a cue, as it's a playful and mocking way to repeat joey's phrase back to him. overall, the tone and language used in this response are clearly sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         ### explanation: 

         this response is sarcastic because it uses irony. chandler says ""that's so funny"" but what follows is not funny at all. instead, it's a mocking comment that joey looks more like a woman. the use of the phrase ""that's so funny"" is a rhetorical device that implies the opposite of what it says. it's a way of saying something is ridiculous or stupid, rather than actually being funny. the context of the conversation also suggests sarcasm, as chandler is responding to joey's announcement of being a model, which is likely to be met with skepticism.",1.0,1.0

        ","the correct label for the given input is: sarcastic.

the reason for this classification is that the sentence uses an unexpected comparison (a monkey with a ross on its ass) which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. the use of the name ""ross"" in this context is likely a humorous reference to a friend or acquaintance, adding to the sarcastic tone. the sentence also has an informal, playful language style, which is consistent with sarcastic language. overall, the sentence's absurdity and playfulness suggest that it is intended to be sarcastic rather than literal.",1.0,"i will assign the label: 'sarcastic'

        CHANDLER: Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved and not they're all recommending Trident?

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 
        the label is sarcastic because the context of the conversation is a reference to a tv show known for its sarcasm, which implies chandler's tone is likely to be sarcastic as well. the sentence itself contains a sarcastic tone through the use of the phrase ""not they're all"" which is an exaggeration, and the punctuation of a question mark at the end of the sentence further emphasizes the sarcasm. additionally, the use of the phrase ""the fifth dentist"" is a clear exaggeration and a common trope in advertising, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        this is an example of sarcasm because the speaker, chandler, is making a humorous comment that is the opposite of what he really means. the phrase ""the fifth dentist caved"" is a playful way of saying that all dentists now recommend trident, which is an exaggeration and not meant to be taken literally. the use of the word ""caved"" also implies that the dentists were somehow forced into making this recommendation, which is unlikely. the tone of the sentence is lighthearted and playful, which is typical of sarcasm. additionally, the use of the phrase ""not they're all"" is a rhetorical device that adds to the sarcastic tone.

        the keywords that indicate sarcasm in this sentence are ""caved"" and ""not they're all"", which are used in a way that is opposite of their literal meaning. the surface emotion is one of amusement and playfulness, but the underlying emotion is likely annoyance or frustration. the context of the conversation, which involves a discussion of a tv show, also suggests that the tone is lighthearted and humorous. the cultural background of the show, which is an american sitcom, also influences the way that sarcasm is used and understood. overall, the combination of these cues suggests that the sentence is an example of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

         (explanation: the text uses rhetorical devices like irony and sarcasm. the surface emotion is annoyance. the cultural background is the knowledge of the trident commercial where four out of five dentists recommended trident.)",1.0,1.0

        ",sarcastic,1.0,"the correct label is 'sarcastic'. 

        the context cue: the conversation is about ross's past experiences, and joey's comment is not related to the topic. it seems like joey is mocking someone's action, which is a common trait of sarcastic behavior.

        the punctuation cue: there is no specific punctuation that indicates sarcasm, but the tone of the sentence is informal and playful, which might suggest sarcasm.

        the surface emotion cue: the surface emotion of the sentence is playful and teasing, which could be an indicator of sarcasm.

        the topic cue: the topic is a continuation of a conversation, and joey's comment seems out of place, which could indicate sarcasm.

        the cultural background cue: in western cultures, sarcasm is a common way to express humor or annoyance. the tone of the sentence is consistent with this cultural background.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

         the input sentence is labeled as sarcastic because of the use of the emotional word ""good"" in a way that is not genuinely positive, but rather condescending. the topic of the sentence is about giving unsolicited advice in a ridiculous manner. the punctuation used is a period, which is a neutral punctuation mark. the language style is informal and playful, which is typical of sarcasm. finally, the cultural background of the context is that of a group of friends joking around, which is a common setting for sarcastic remarks.",1.0,1.0

        the label is sarcastic because of the presence of emotional contrast. ross's response is a mix of surprise (oh my god) and curiosity (what happened?). however, the tone is not genuinely concerned but rather playful and mocking. this contrast between the surface emotion and the intended meaning indicates sarcasm. the use of ""wh-"" at the beginning of ""what"" also suggests a hint of mockery.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reason: 

        the reason for this classification is the use of rhetorical devices. specifically, the use of an exaggerated phrase ""oh my god"" and a drawn-out ""wh-what"" suggest that ross is not genuinely surprised or concerned, but rather being facetious. the context also suggests that ross might not be taking the break-up seriously. overall, ross's response is dripping with sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ","sarcastic

        the given dialogue is a conversation between monica and phoebe from the popular tv show friends. in this context, monica's response ""what?!?!"" is a sarcastic expression, implying that phoebe's excuse for not turning the cushion over (having a big spaghetti stain on the other side) is ridiculous or unbelievable. 

        the cultural background cue is the reference to the popular tv show friends, which provides context to the conversation. the emotional word ""what?!?!"" conveys a sense of surprise or disbelief, but the tone is sarcastic rather than genuine. there is an emotional contrast between monica's incredulous tone and phoebe's nonchalant excuse. the common knowledge cue is the understanding that people usually try to clean or hide stains, rather than leaving them visible. the surface emotion of monica's response is annoyance or frustration, but the underlying tone is sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the label is sarcastic because monica's response ""what?!?!"" is an exclamation with multiple question marks and an exclamation mark which indicates strong emotions, surprise, and possibly annoyance. monica is being sarcastic towards phoebe's explanation about the spaghetti stain.",1.0,"i would label this text as 'sarcastic'. 

         the cues that suggest this label are: 

         1. rhetorical devices: the use of 'what?!?!' implies a sense of incredulity and shock, which is an exaggeration and a classic sarcastic tone.
         2. emotional contrasts: monica's initial calm tone in the previous dialogue contrasts with her sudden outrage and surprise in this sentence, indicating sarcasm.
         3. punctuation: the use of multiple exclamation marks (!!!) emphasizes the sarcastic tone and monica's mock surprise.
         4. surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is shock and disbelief, but the context and tone suggest that monica is being sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        ","i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. 

         the cues that led me to this conclusion are:

         - language style: the use of over-the-top enthusiasm and exclamation marks suggests insincerity.
         - surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is one of extreme gratitude, which is contrasted with the previous conversation where rachel is not thrilled about living with ross.
         - rhetorical devices: the repetition of ""ross"" at the beginning of the sentence can be seen as a form of irony or sarcasm.
         - keywords: the phrase ""you have no idea"" is often used to express sarcasm or annoyance.
         - emotional contrasts: the contrast between rachel's previous reluctance to live with ross and her current over-the-top gratitude suggests that she is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

         reason: 
         there are a few cues that indicate rachel's statement is sarcastic. firstly, her tone is overly enthusiastic, which contrasts with her previous reluctance to move in with ross. secondly, she repeats ross's name, which can be seen as a form of mocking or playfulness. finally, the phrase ""you have no idea what this means to me"" is a common phrase used in a sarcastic tone to express the opposite sentiment, i.e., that ross has a very good idea what it means to rachel.",1.0,"the given input is labeled as ""sarcastic"". the cues that lead to this classification are:

* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is one of excitement and gratitude, but it's over-the-top and exaggerated, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.
* language style: the use of repetitive and insistent tone (""ross-ross"") is a stylistic cue that suggests sarcasm.
* rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (""you have no idea what this means to me!"") is a rhetorical device that can be employed to convey sarcasm.
* topic: the topic of the conversation is ross's offer to let rachel live with him, which is being responded to in a way that's overly dramatic and insincere.
* keywords: the use of words like ""no idea"" and ""means to me"" in an exaggerated way are keywords that can indicate sarcasm.

overall, the tone and language used in the input suggest that rachel is being facetious and insincere in her response, which is characteristic of sarcastic language.",1.0,1.0

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

         the given dialogue is sarcastic as it contains an emotional contrast between the tone of the previous conversation (concerned) and joey's current tone (nonchalant). the topic is a stain, which is a trivial matter, and joey's response seems dismissive, implying sarcasm. the use of ""yeah!"" at the beginning of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone, as it can be seen as an over-the-top agreement. the language style is casual, with an exclamation mark, which further reinforces the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        the punctuation, an exclamation mark (!), is used to convey a sense of enthusiasm, which is ironic given the context of the situation, implying sarcasm. the word ""yeah"" also has a casual and dismissive tone, which contributes to the sarcastic tone. the phrase ""look!"" is also a rhetorical device, used to draw attention to something in a way that is overly dramatic, adding to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"sarcastic 

the response is labeled as sarcastic because of the context. joey's previous sentence ""hey! it's fine! you're at joey's!"" implies that he is trying to downplay the situation, and rachel's response ""really?"" is skeptical. therefore, when joey says ""yeah! look!"", it's likely that he's being sarcastic, implying that there's nothing to look at or that the situation is not as fine as he previously claimed. the use of the word ""yeah"" with an exclamation mark also adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

         here's my reasoning: 
         the topic of the conversation is monica's birthday party. 
         emotional contrast is present as joey's tone is opposite of what one would expect in this situation. 
         emotional word'surprised' is used, which implies that joey is being facetious. 
         keywords 'act' and 'better' imply that joey is being insincere. 
         from common knowledge, we know that people usually want to be genuinely surprised on their birthdays, but joey's comment implies the opposite. 
         therefore, based on these cues, the label 'sarcastic' is assigned to the input text.",1.0,"i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text.

         2. common knowledge: it is generally not necessary to remove one's shirt to understand a situation, which implies that the speaker is being facetious.

         3. rhetorical devices: the phrase 'let's see what we're dealing with here' is an example of a rhetorical device, as it is used to convey the speaker's skepticism and sarcasm.

         5. special symbols: there are no special symbols in this input.",1.0,"the correct label for the input text is 'not sarcastic'. here's why:

         rhetorical devices: there are no obvious rhetorical devices such as irony, understatement, or hyperbole that would suggest sarcasm.

         punctuation: the punctuation is straightforward and does not include excessive use of exclamation points, ellipses, or question marks that might indicate sarcasm.

         cultural background: the context of the conversation is unclear, but it appears to be a medical or examination scenario, which suggests a more serious and less sarcastic tone.

the emotional contrast cue is not prominent in this input, as there is no obvious contradiction between what is said and what is meant.

the surface emotion cue suggests that the speaker is neutral or slightly curious, as they are asking questions about the situation.

the language style cue suggests that the speaker is direct and to-the-point, using imperative sentences to ask the person to take their shirt off.

        the response from joey contains a hint of sarcasm. the phrase 'some, not a lot' is a clear indication of sarcasm as it is a rhetorical device used to convey the opposite meaning of what is being said. joey is implying that he has not had a lot of sex, but the way he says it is sarcastic. additionally, the use of the word'some' is also a cue for sarcasm as it is a vague term that can be interpreted in different ways. overall, the tone and language used by joey in this response suggest that he is being sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic 
        (the language style is informal, with a touch of humor. the keyword ""some, not a lot"" is used to downplay the initial statement, and the tone is playful. the use of the word ""some"" is a common way to respond to an exaggerated claim, which is a common knowledge. the surface emotion is playful and lighthearted, indicating sarcasm.)",1.0,1.0

        the input text is sarcastic. the cue ""y'know"" is a common knowledge cue, which implies the speaker is being condescending. the surface emotion is excitement, but the context and the use of ""wuss"" imply a more negative tone. the phrase ""get those off"" is a rhetorical device, implying that the speaker doesn't think highly of chandler's decision. the use of ""!!"" is a special symbol, indicating strong emotions. finally, ""wuss"" is an emotional word, implying that the speaker is being mocking.",1.0,"i would label this text as 'sarcastic'. the cues that led me to this conclusion are:
         1. rhetorical device: the use of 'y'know you' which is an informal way of addressing someone and is often used in a sarcastic tone.

         4. surface emotion: the sentence seems to be encouraging chandler to do something, but the tone is more mocking than genuine.

4. **special symbols**: there are no special symbols in this input.

5. **punctuation**: the exclamation marks after ""are you kidding"" and ""morning's here! morning is here,"" may suggest excitement or emphasis, but in the context of the conversation, they come across as insincere or ironic, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        4. **context:** the conversation context is important here. chandler is responding to joey's statement about a table, and his response is an exaggerated and unlikely explanation. this context suggests sarcasm.
        5. **topic:** the topic of the conversation is a table, but it's not a topic that inherently indicates sarcasm. however, the context of the conversation and the tone of chandler's response do suggest sarcasm.

         the cues that lead to this label are:

         2. language style: the use of a formal and polite phrase ""i believe"" is used to convey sarcasm, which is a characteristic of chandler's language style in the tv show friends.
         3. emotional words: the word ""adventure"" is used in a sarcastic way to describe a potentially messy or chaotic situation.
         4. keywords: the mention of ""angela delvecchio"" adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that chandler is annoyed or frustrated with joey's behavior.
         5. cultural background: the context of the conversation, which is a tv show friends, is known for its witty banter and sarcasm, which makes it more likely that chandler's statement is sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

        **surface emotion:** the surface emotion in chandler's response appears to be nonchalant and carefree.

        considering all the cues, the correct label for the input text is: **sarcastic**. chandler's response is sarcastic because he's being facetious about not needing a savings account, implying that he spent all his money on the tv. the tone is playful, but the underlying message is ironic and mocking.",1.0,"### output:

        ### reasoning: 

        the given input is sarcastic because it contains a rhetorical device, specifically irony. phoebe is implying that chandler's reason for liking the girl is ridiculously simple and obvious, as if it's a remarkable achievement to sing and play guitar at the same time. the use of ""why? because"" and the emphasis on the obviousness of the action convey the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"the correct label is 'sarcastic'. here's why:
         - emotional contrast: phoebe's tone is opposite of what you would expect from her previous statement, which was also sarcastic.
         - emotional words: 'why?' is a word that can be used in a condescending way, and the tone implies annoyance.
         - keywords: phoebe's sentence structure and word choice (e.g., 'both at the same time') is exaggerated, implying sarcasm.
         - common knowledge: the ability to sing and play guitar at the same time is a basic skill for many musicians, so phoebe's comment is an obvious exaggeration.
         - language style: phoebe's response has a mocking, condescending tone, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

         therefore, the label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic


        ### reasoning: 

         in this dialogue, phoebe's response is dripping with sarcasm. the language style used by phoebe is ironic and mocking, implying that chandler's admiration for the girl is shallow and based on very basic skills. the context of the conversation and the tone of phoebe's previous response ( oh-ho yeah! a song with rhyming words. oo, i never thought of that before.) also suggest that she is being sarcastic. the use of rhetorical questions (why? because...) further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        the given response is sarcastic because it contains a high level of enthusiasm and excitement (surface emotion), which is exaggerated and ironic in this context. the excessive use of 'h's in 'ohhh' (special symbols) adds to the sarcastic tone. the context also plays a crucial role as ross is struggling to ask a question and rachel's response is a clear exaggeration of interest.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the context of the conversation is that ross is trying to ask a question, but he's hesitating and unsure of himself. rachel's response of ""ohhh!!!!"" is an exaggerated and over-the-top reaction, implying that she's not really interested or excited, but rather annoyed or frustrated with ross's hesitation. this is a clear example of sarcasm. the surface emotion is one of excitement or surprise, but the language style is playful and ironic, with an excessive use of exclamation points. the rhetorical device used is irony, where rachel says the opposite of what she really means. the emotional words used are ""ohhh!!!!"", which convey a sense of fake enthusiasm. therefore, the correct label for this input text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,1.0

        ","sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

         the language style is informal and playful, which is typical of sarcastic responses. the context is that the person is asking joey to show them his porsche, and joey's response is an unexpected and humorous deflection. the use of the phrase ""tucked her in"" is a clever and ironic way of saying that the car is covered, implying that it's being treated like a person. the punctuation, specifically the use of commas, adds to the playful and sarcastic tone. the common knowledge that people don't ""tuck in"" cars like they do with humans adds to the humor and sarcasm. the keywords ""tucked her in"" are a clear indication of sarcasm. overall, the response is a lighthearted and humorous way of saying ""no"" to the person's request, which is a classic characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### explanation: 
        the topic is the porsche, and the rhetorical device used is irony. the emotional words are 'amazing' and 'love', but the emotional contrast is that joey is being sarcastic and doesn't really want to show the porsche. the common knowledge is that people don't 'tuck in' cars. therefore, the label is sarcastic.",1.0,"i would label this input as 'sarcastic'. 

the cues that led me to this conclusion are:

* special symbols: the use of quotation marks around ""her"" to emphasize the absurdity of referring to a car as a person.
* rhetorical devices: the use of irony, as joey is saying the opposite of what he means (he doesn't actually tuck his car in).
* surface emotion: the tone of the response is playful and lighthearted, but with a hint of sarcasm.
* topic: the conversation is about joey's porsche, and the response is a humorous and sarcastic way to deflect the person's interest in seeing the car.
* common knowledge: it's common knowledge that cars are not typically ""tucked in"" like a person would be, which adds to the absurdity and sarcasm of the response.",1.0,1.0

        ### Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the context and input, i will analyze the cues as follows:

1. surface emotion: the surface emotion in the input is apologetic, as ross says ""i'm sorry"".
2. topic: the topic is about going away together on spring vacation.
3. emotional words: the emotional word used is ""sorry"", which implies a sense of regret or hesitation.
4. emotional contrasts: there is a contrast between ross's initial enthusiasm about spring vacation and his sudden hesitation to go away together, which may indicate a sense of sarcasm.
5. rhetorical devices: the phrase ""so, i'm sorry"" can be seen as a rhetorical device, as it's a polite way of saying no, but the tone may be insincere.

considering these cues, i would label the input as 'sarcastic'. the apologetic tone and use of the phrase ""i'm sorry"" may be a way of masking ross's true feelings, which could be annoyance or frustration about going away together. the contrast between his initial enthusiasm and sudden hesitation also suggests that he might be being sarcastic.",1.0,"the correct label is 'sarcastic'. this response is sarcastic because the tone is opposite of what the speaker truly means. the speaker is saying they don't want to go away together, but it's likely they are just making an excuse. the surface emotion is one of reluctance or hesitation, but the true emotion is likely disinterest. the use of ""so"" at the beginning of the sentence is a rhetorical device that softens the blow, making the speaker sound more polite, but also makes the statement sound insincere. additionally, the phrase ""i'm sorry"" is often used to express regret or apology, but in this context, it's being used to make the speaker sound more considerate, which adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"the correct answer is: sarcastic.

        the cue is the language style, particularly the use of ""so"" at the beginning of the sentence, which is often used to soften the tone of what follows, but in this case, it's used to contradict the previous statement, indicating sarcasm. additionally, the phrase ""i just don't think"" is a common way to express a negative opinion in a polite way, which further suggests sarcasm. the context of the conversation, where ross is trying to slow down the relationship, also supports the label of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        the surface emotion of the text is neutral. however, the emotional contrast between the actual situation (krog is a danger to the universe) and the absurdity of chandler's statement (protecting them from a tornado) implies sarcasm. the context of the conversation also suggests that chandler is being sarcastic. there is no special symbol in the text. the topic is about krog and its threat to the universe.",1.0,"the correct answer is: sarcastic.

        the explanation for this classification is as follows:
        - punctuation: the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a tone of incredulity and surprise, which is often associated with sarcasm.
        - rhetorical devices: the sentence is a rhetorical question, implying that the idea of chandler protecting someone from a tornado is absurd, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.
        - topic: the topic of the conversation is chandler's abilities, and the sentence is a humorous and exaggerated response to phoebe's question.
        - keywords: the keyword ""tornado"" is used to emphasize the absurdity of the situation, which is a common trait of sarcastic language.
        - cultural background: the dialogue is from the tv show friends, which is known for its witty and humorous banter, often involving sarcasm. chandler's character, in particular, is infamous for his sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the cue that is used here is the language style. the phrase 'and protected them from a tornado?' is a rhetorical question that is asked in an ironic tone, implying that the previous statement is an exaggeration. the use of hyperbole and irony in the language style suggests that the statement is sarcastic.",1.0,1.0

the given response 'no!' by monica seems to be sarcastic because of the context. ross is excitedly asking monica to sing along, and monica responds with a simple 'no!' which is a negative response, indicating that she is not interested in singing along. the tone of monica's response is dismissive and unenthusiastic, which suggests sarcasm. also, the exclamation mark at the end of 'no!' emphasizes the sarcastic tone. hence, the correct label for this response is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"label: sarcastic

         - special symbols: none

         in this response, phoebe is using a rhetorical device (a questioning tone) to express sarcasm. the topic is the plan to break into the mini-van, which is already an unusual and humorous situation. the punctuation (the question mark) also adds to the sarcastic tone. the emotional contrast is that phoebe seems to be expressing uncertainty or doubt, but it's clear she's being facetious. the surface emotion is annoyance or frustration, but the underlying emotion is sarcasm.",1.0,"not sarcastic

        2. common knowledge: the concept of ""interfacing"" is commonly associated with computers and machines, which is the context of the conversation.

        3. rhetorical devices: irony is used when ross says ""interfacing"" to describe their simple conversation.

        4. topic: the topic of the conversation is about downloading thoughts and memories into a computer.

         the cultural background cue: the conversation style is from the popular american tv show 'friends', which is known for its witty dialogues and sarcastic tone.

         the punctuation cue: the use of 'y'know' instead of 'you know' is informal and casual, which often indicates sarcasm in spoken language. 

         the rhetorical device cue: the sentence is a clear case of irony, as chandler is saying the opposite of what he means, implying that he and monica are more than 'nothing'.

        2. topic: the topic is a continuation of a previous conversation, and phoebe's tone is defensive and accusatory, indicating sarcasm.

         * context: the conversation is about puppies being cute or ugly, and phoebe's response seems out of place and unrelated to the topic. this sudden change in topic and tone can be seen as sarcastic.

the input text is classified as 'sarcastic' because of the following cues:
1. **topic**: the topic is related to unagi, which is a concept introduced in the previous dialogue, and chandler is correcting ross's misunderstanding of it.
2. **common knowledge**: the common knowledge here is that unagi is a type of eel, which is not a commonly associated concept with being ""aware"" or having a sixth sense.
3. **emotional words**: the word ""okay"" can be interpreted as a slight annoyance or frustration, indicating chandler's emotional tone.
4. **cultural background**: the cultural background is from the tv show friends, which is known for its witty humor and sarcasm.
5. **punctuation**: the use of the question mark after ""are you aware"" emphasizes chandler's incredulity and sarcasm.

        the reasoning behind this label is that phoebe is saying that joey couldn't do what jake did, which is wear women's underwear. the context implies that joey is not secure with his masculinity, which is the opposite of what phoebe previously said about jake. this contrast between what phoebe said about jake and what she is implying about joey is a cue for sarcasm, specifically emotional contrast. additionally, phoebe's language style is casual and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic tone. overall, the label is sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the cue for this classification is the short and curt response ""yeah!"" which implies that phoebe is not actually enthusiastic about entering monica's apartment. the cultural background of the context is a scene from the tv show friends, where the characters often use sarcasm in their dialogue. the rhetorical device used here is irony, as phoebe's response is opposite of what she actually means. the topic of the conversation is phoebe entering monica's apartment. there is no common knowledge cue in this input. the emotional word in this input is ""yeah!"" which has a sarcastic tone. therefore, the correct label for this input is ""sarcastic"".",1.0,"sarcastic 

        ### reasoning:
        the cue that stands out the most is the use of a rhetorical device, specifically a very short and abrupt response (""yeah!"") which is often used in a sarcastic tone. this, combined with the context of the conversation, where monica is trying to get phoebe's attention and phoebe is trying to interrupt, suggests that phoebe's response is likely sarcastic. additionally, the exclamation mark at the end of ""yeah!"" adds emphasis to the tone, making it more likely to be sarcastic.",1.0,"label: sarcastic
         reason: 
         - emotional contrast: phoebe's response is short and informal, which contrasts with monica's polite and formal tone.
         - topic: the conversation is about entering a room or space.
         - language style: phoebe's response is brief and assertive.
         - keywords: yeah (can be used in a sarcastic tone)

         reasoning: the response ""why?"" is a brief and somewhat annoyed response, implying that phoebe is not genuinely curious about the person's tiredness, but rather frustrated or sarcastic about the person's excuse to not continue their previous activity. the tone of the response is informal and slightly confrontational, which also suggests sarcasm. 

         cues: 
         - emotional words: annoyed, frustrated 
         - emotional contrasts: the contrast between the person's excuse and phoebe's response 
         - common knowledge: people often use brief responses like ""why?"" to express annoyance or frustration

        ### explanation: 
        the keyword 'why?' in this context is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the tone is inquiring, but the implication is that the speaker already knows the reason and is being facetious. this is further supported by the context, as the person is making an excuse about being tired, and phoebe's response is likely a reaction to that excuse, implying that it's not a valid reason. the tone is playful and teasing, which is consistent with sarcasm.",1.0,"i would assign a label of ""sarcastic"" to this input. the cue that led me to this conclusion was the single word ""why?"" which is a keyword that often implies skepticism or annoyance, a common tone in sarcastic speech. additionally, the brevity of the response and the context of the conversation (phoebe's initial enthusiasm and the person's reluctance) suggest that phoebe's ""why?"" may be a rhetorical question, implying that the person's excuse is not a valid one.",1.0,1.0

the response is correct. the label is 'sarcastic' because the sentence is an obvious exaggeration, implying that the lifeguard's task is much more important than chandler's current activity. the use of the phrase ""dismantle a nuclear device"" is an absurd and unrealistic scenario, which is a common characteristic of sarcastic language. additionally, the tone of the sentence is playful and humorous, which is another indicator of sarcasm.",1.0,"the label for this input is 'sarcastic'.

         - surface emotion: chandler's tone seems to be casual and matter-of-fact, but there is a hint of sarcasm in his words. 
         - common knowledge: it is highly unlikely that a lifeguard would be dismantling a nuclear device. 
         - cultural background: this conversation seems to be set in a western cultural context, possibly an american sitcom, where sarcasm is a common form of humor. 
         - punctuation: there is no specific punctuation that stands out in this input, but the use of ""anyway"" at the beginning of the sentence can be seen as a transition word that leads to a sarcastic comment.",1.0,'sarcastic',1.0,1.0

the context provides information about chandler's previous statement, which was sarcastic. chandler's current statement ""okay, now much have you won so far?"" is a follow-up question, but the tone is still sarcastic. the use of ""okay"" at the beginning of the sentence and the casual tone imply that chandler is being facetious. the context and the tone of the conversation suggest that chandler's statement is sarcastic.",1.0,"the correct label is 'sarcastic'. the cue here is the context. in the previous conversation, chandler was boasting about winning with a three and a six, which is an unlikely winning hand. this implies that chandler is being sarcastic when he asks how much joey has won.",1.0,"i would label this as ""not sarcastic"". 

        here's my reasoning:

        - keywords: there are no obvious keywords that indicate sarcasm, such as ""yeah right"" or ""wow"".
        - context: the conversation is about playing a game, and chandler's question seems genuine, asking about the current score.

        - cultural background: the conversation is from the tv show friends, which is known for its witty humor but not necessarily sarcasm.
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion is curiosity, as chandler is asking about the current score.

        overall, the tone of the conversation is playful and friendly, and chandler's question seems like a genuine inquiry, so i would label it as ""not sarcastic"".",0.0,1.0

- the context of the previous conversation, where chandler is saying ""i can't take it anymore"" and then suddenly addresses phoebe in a seemingly non-sequitur way, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

         the keyword 'fired' is an emotional cue that implies a strong negative sentiment. the context of the conversation reveals that jack had called to check on phoebe's well-being, and ross is trying to calm her down. therefore, ross's statement'she's fired' is likely to be sarcastic, implying the opposite of what the words literally mean. this is an example of emotional contrast, where the surface emotion (calm and reassuring) contradicts the literal meaning of the words (negative and alarming). the cultural background of the conversation, being a casual conversation among friends, also suggests that sarcasm is more likely.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reasoning: 

        the reasoning behind this classification is the presence of rhetorical devices like irony and sarcasm. the phrase ""you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with"" is an exaggeration and is meant to be the opposite of what ross actually means, implying that rachel will be more focused on her child than her relationships. ross' tone is also dripping with sarcasm, implying that rachel's life is about to become drastically different and not in a good way. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the speaker says the opposite of what they mean to be humorous or ironic. the context of the conversation also plays a role, as ross is responding to rachel's concerns about her life changing, and his statement is a way of poking fun at her situation.",1.0,"the label for the above input is 'sarcastic'. the cues are as follows:
         - language style: the language used is casual and conversational, which is often associated with sarcasm.

         - special symbols: none
         - topic: the topic is a personal conversation about relationships.
         - rhetorical devices: the use of ""on the other hand"" is a rhetorical device that indicates a contrast, which in this case, is used sarcastically to downplay the current difficulties and imply that the future will be better. the phrase ""more than any guy you've ever gone out with"" is also an exaggeration, which is a common rhetorical device used in sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

        ### explanation: 

        the cue for this classification is the language style. rachel's response is a continuation of her previous statement, where she is being sarcastic about monica's obsession with cleanliness. the phrase ""even if people are on it!"" is an exaggeration and an obvious impossibility, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. the tone is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic language. the cultural background of the dialogue is a sitcom, friends, where the characters often engage in witty and sarcastic banter. the topic is monica's cleanliness habits, and the keywords are ""even if people are on it"", which implies that monica would clean the toilet even if someone is using it, which is an absurd scenario. the rhetorical device used is hyperbole, which is a common device in sarcasm.",1.0,"the correct label is 'sarcastic'. this label is assigned based on the following cues:

        1. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text is annoyance or frustration. this is evident from the use of the phrase ""you know what else i'm not gonna miss"" which indicates that the speaker is tired of something. this emotion is often a precursor to sarcasm.

        2. emotional words: the word ""even"" in the sentence ""even if people are on it"" is an emotional word that indicates a sense of exasperation.

        3. context: the context of the conversation is about monica's cleanliness habits, which is an exaggerated trait. the speaker's comment is a reaction to this trait, implying that monica's cleanliness habits are over the top.

        4. punctuation: the use of the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence ""even if people are on it!"" adds emphasis and indicates a strong emotional tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

        5. language style: the language style is informal and conversational, which is typical of sarcastic tone. the use of the phrase ""you know what else i'm not gonna miss"" is a colloquial expression that is often used in informal conversations.

         2. emotional words: there are no overtly emotional words in the sentence, but the tone is playful and casual, which can be indicative of sarcasm.

         4. context: the context of the conversation is about rachel and joey both being sick, and joey's response is a clever and humorous way to deflect rachel's question, implying that his room and hamper are a mess.
         5. cultural background: the cultural background of the conversation is a sitcom-style dialogue, where witty banter and sarcasm are common.

1. **common knowledge**: it's common knowledge that people usually clean their clothes and don't leave them in the hamper for a long time, especially when they're sick.
2. **keywords**: ""you don't want to"" is a phrase that implies something unpleasant or undesirable, which could be an indicator of sarcasm.
3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""yeah"" at the beginning of the sentence could be a rhetorical device to acknowledge the previous statement and then subvert the expectation.
4. **context**: the conversation is about being sick and not crossing paths, which adds to the humor and irony of joey's statement.
5. **emotional words**: there are no explicit emotional words in the sentence, but the tone and context suggest a lighthearted and humorous tone.

        rhetorical devices: the text does not contain any obvious rhetorical devices like irony, hyperbole, or understatement.

        keywords: the keywords in this text are ""guarantee"", ""nice"", and ""happy"". these words do not have any inherent sarcastic tone.

        punctuation: the text contains a period at the end, which is a standard punctuation mark and does not indicate sarcasm.

        - language style: the brevity and directness of the response, especially after ross's overly emotional speech, can be seen as sarcastic. 
        - surface emotion: the surface emotion of the response is negative, which contrasts with ross's emotional and romantic tone, implying sarcasm. 
        - keywords: the word ""no"" is a strong indicator of disagreement or rejection, which can be seen as sarcastic in this context. 
        - emotional words: there are no overtly emotional words in the response, but the tone and context imply a sense of annoyance or frustration, which can be associated with sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the response is labeled as sarcastic because it is a short, abrupt, and contrasting response to ross's emotional and romantic speech. rachel's response is not a genuine answer, but rather a sarcastic dismissal of ross's sentiment. the surface emotion is annoyance or frustration, and the keywords are the single word ""no"", which indicates a strong negative sentiment. the emotional contrast is between ross's romantic and emotional speech and rachel's cold and dismissive response. the language style is informal and conversational, but with a tone of sarcasm. the context of the conversation, with ross being overly romantic and rachel responding with a single word, also indicates sarcasm.",1.0,"the input text is: rachel: no.

based on the context, the topic is a romantic relationship, and the keywords are ""i can't imagine"" and ""without you"". the emotional words are ""heart"" and ""good heart"", indicating affection and love. there are no explicit rhetorical devices used in the input text. the context suggests that ross is being overly dramatic and sentimental, and rachel's response ""no"" can be seen as a sarcastic reaction to his melodrama.

- surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is excitement and enthusiasm, but it's exaggerated to the point of being insincere.
- punctuation: the use of multiple exclamation marks (!) and the phrase 'nooo!' suggests a playful, almost mocking tone.

        2. language style: the use of hyperbolic language (""best time ever!"", ""you rocked my world!"") is exaggerated and ironic, implying sarcasm.

         - the keywords used are ""best time ever"" and ""you rocked my world"", which are overly positive phrases that might be used in a sarcastic tone.
         - the rhetorical device used is hyperbole, which is an exaggeration used for emphasis or effect. in this case, it might be used to convey sarcasm.

         sarcastic

        the cues that led me to this conclusion are:
        - language style: the use of ""hey"" and ""look now"" at the beginning of the sentence is informal and conversational, which can be a sign of sarcasm.
        - cultural background: the context of the conversation is a casual conversation between friends, which is a common setting for sarcasm.
        - surface emotion: the tone of the sentence seems to be condescending, which is a common surface emotion associated with sarcasm.
        - special symbols: there are no special symbols in this sentence.
        - rhetorical devices: the use of ""hey"" and ""look now"" can be seen as a rhetorical device to grab attention and make the sentence sound more sarcastic.",0.0,"sarcastic

        the cue here is the use of rhetorical devices, specifically irony. joey is saying that people are fulfilling their christmas spirit, but the tone of his voice and the context of the conversation imply that he doesn't actually think that's what's happening. the word ""hey"" at the beginning of the sentence also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it comes across as insincere.",1.0,"to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic', i will analyze the following cues:

1. **punctuation**: the input text contains an excessive use of commas ("","") which can indicate a sarcastic tone.
2. **special symbols**: there are no special symbols in the input text.
3. **surface emotion**: the surface emotion in the input text appears to be casual and conversational, but the excessive use of commas and the phrase ""hey"" may hint at a sarcastic tone.
4. **topic**: the topic of the conversation is christmas, which is a neutral topic, but the way it's being discussed may imply sarcasm.
5. **emotional words**: the word ""hey"" can be seen as an emotional word, but in this context, it's used in a casual manner. however, the phrase ""fulfilling their christmas"" might be an emotional phrase, implying that joey is being sarcastic about people's enthusiasm for christmas.

considering these cues, i would label the input text as **sarcastic**.",0.0,0.0

        ","the given input is sarcastic. the cues that lead to this classification are:

- surface emotion: the surface emotion of the text appears to be helpful and informative, but it's actually opposite of that.
- topic: the topic is about finding someone, but the response is not genuine.
- punctuation: the use of a period at the end of the sentence adds a sense of finality, which is ironic given the sarcastic tone.
- context: the context of the conversation implies that blanche is looking for someone, but dorothy's response is not helpful.
- emotional words: the use of the word ""again"" implies that dorothy has done this before, and the tone is playful and mocking.",1.0,"the correct label is: sarcastic

         reasoning: 

         the context and the tone of the response indicate that dorothy is being sarcastic. the sentence ""but now i have hidden her again so you can find her"" is a clear indication of sarcasm. it's an ironic and humorous response that implies the opposite of what it literally says. dorothy is not actually going to hide someone, but rather, she's making a joke about blanche's incompetence. the use of the phrase ""so you can find her"" is a giveaway, as it's an obvious exaggeration and an attempt to be facetious. the tone is playful and teasing, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### reason: 

         the response has a surface emotion of friendliness and helpfulness, but it is actually being sarcastic. the rhetorical device used here is irony, as the speaker is saying the opposite of what they mean. the emotional word used is ""hidden"" which implies the speaker is annoyed or frustrated. the special symbol used is the period which implies a sense of finality and sarcasm. the common knowledge here is that you wouldn't actually hide something from someone if you wanted them to find it, implying that the speaker is being facetious.",1.0,1.0

**surface emotion:** the surface emotion in the input text seems to be annoyance or frustration, as dorothy mentions she can't make sense of the commercials.

**language style:** the language style is informal, with a hint of exasperation.

**topic:** the topic is dorothy's reason for being upset, which is the commercials for obsession.

**special symbols:** there are no special symbols in the input text.

**keywords:** the keywords are ""can't make any sense"", ""commercials"", and ""obsession"", which convey a sense of frustration and annoyance.

considering these cues, i'd assign the label: **sarcastic**

the tone of the input text seems to be sarcastic, implying that the commercials are ridiculous or nonsensical, and dorothy is being facetious about not being able to understand them.",1.0,"the correct label for the given input text is 'sarcastic'. 

here, the cue for sarcasm is the use of rhetorical devices (understatement: ""cannot make any sense"" and irony: saying something opposite of what is actually meant, i.e., being upset about something else, but saying it's about the commercials). additionally, the language style is informal and conversational, which can also be an indicator of sarcasm.",1.0,1.0

         the cues that lead to this conclusion are: 

         - context: the conversation is between dorothy and sophia, and dorothy is making a comment about studying for a french final with distractions at home. 

         - surface emotion: the tone of the response is dismissive and playful, indicating sarcasm. 

         - common knowledge: it is highly unlikely that cary grant, a famous actor, would be living in dorothy's broom closet. 

         - language style: the use of ""of course not ma"" is a clear indication of sarcasm, as it is an exaggerated and insincere response. 

         - topic: the topic of the conversation is studying for a french final, but dorothy's response is unrelated and absurd, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.",1.0,"i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the given text. 
         here's why:

        * emotional words: 'ofcourse' is used in a tone of annoyance and frustration, indicating sarcasm.
        * common knowledge: it is common knowledge that carrey grant is a famous actor who is not likely to be living in a broom closet, which makes the statement absurd and sarcastic.
        * topic: the topic of the conversation is studying for a french final, and dorothy's response is unrelated and absurd, indicating sarcasm.
        * punctuation: the use of a comma after 'ofcourse' creates a sense of pause and adds to the sarcastic tone.
        * rhetorical devices: the use of irony and absurdity in the statement 'carrey grant... is living in the broom closet' is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

        therefore, based on these cues, i believe the correct label for the given text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        the input text is sarcastic because the language style is opposite of what the speaker intends to mean. the speaker is saying that rose should do something that is obviously dangerous and reckless (going over niagara falls in a barrel), but the tone of the sentence implies that it's a bad idea. the context of the conversation also helps in understanding the sarcasm as rose has just mentioned that she is not going to do it.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the response is sarcastic because dorothy is implying that going to niagra falls in a barrel is a ridiculous idea, and she's being facetious when she says rose should do it. the special symbols in this case are none. the topic is about the previous conversation about not doing extreme activities. the keywords are ""should do"", which implies a sense of obligation or necessity, but in this case, it's being used in a sarcastic tone. the common knowledge is that going to niagra falls in a barrel is dangerous and not a good idea. the surface emotion is playful and lighthearted, but with a hint of sarcasm.",1.0,"sarcastic 

the input text ""dorothy: no rose, that you should do."" is labeled as 'sarcastic' because of the presence of sarcasm cues. here's a breakdown of the cues:

* topic: the conversation is about rose's statements of not doing certain activities, and dorothy's response is unexpected and ironic.
* punctuation: the comma after ""no rose"" creates a pause, which adds to the sarcastic tone.
* common knowledge: it's common knowledge that going over niagara falls in a barrel is a dangerous and absurd act, making dorothy's suggestion even more ridiculous.
* emotional words: there are no strong emotional words in this input, but the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek.
* special symbols: there are no special symbols in this input.

the overall tone and context of the conversation suggest that dorothy's response is meant to be humorous and ironic, making it a sarcastic comment.",1.0,1.0

        ","sarcastic

        ### explanation: 

        context: the conversation is between scott and the moderator in a group setting. scott calls the moderator a sarcasmholic, which implies the moderator is prone to sarcasm.

        surface emotion: the moderator's response appears to be one of frustration or annoyance.

        keywords: 'give up every tuesday', 'help these screwups', 'for the good of my health' are keywords that indicate sarcasm. the use of strong words like'screwups' implies the opposite of what the moderator means.

        rhetorical devices: hyperbole (exaggeration) is used when the moderator says 'give up every tuesday of my life'. 

        cultural background: sarcasm is a common form of humor in western cultures, particularly in the us. the use of irony and understatement is often employed to express frustration or annoyance.

        therefore, based on these cues, the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"the input text is sarcastic. here's the breakdown of the cues:

* topic: the topic seems to be about a group or community, and the moderator's role in it.
* keywords: keywords that indicate sarcasm include ""give up"", ""screwups"", and ""good of my health"", which are all exaggerations or negative phrases.
* rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (""give up every tuesday of my life"") and irony (""for the good of my health"") are clear indicators of sarcasm.
* language style: the tone is informal and conversational, with a hint of frustration and annoyance.
* surface emotion: the surface emotion expressed is one of frustration, annoyance, and possibly even disgust, which is often a hallmark of sarcastic language.

based on these cues, i would label this text as 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"the correct label for the input text is 'sarcastic'. 

         the cues that led to this classification are:

        - keywords: ""give up"", ""screwups"" and ""good of my health"" which are negative and ironic phrases that imply the opposite of what the speaker means.
        - cultural background: the phrase ""good of my health"" is a common idiom in american english that is often used sarcastically to express frustration or annoyance.
        - language style: the use of hyperbole (""give up every tuesday of my life"") and irony (""good of my health"") are characteristic of sarcastic language.
        - surface emotion: the tone of the sentence is one of annoyance and frustration, but the use of irony and hyperbole suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic rather than genuinely upset.
        - punctuation: the use of commas to separate clauses and the exasperated tone of the sentence contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,1.0

        ","i would assign a label of 'sarcastic' to this text. 

         the cues that lead me to this conclusion are: 

         - surface emotion: the initial response ""oh my god i love that!"" conveys a positive emotion, but it is immediately followed by ""really?"" which is a rhetorical device indicating that the speaker is being sarcastic. 
         - rhetorical devices: the use of ""really?"" is a rhetorical device that implies the opposite of what is being said, which is a common way to express sarcasm. 
         - topic: the topic of the conversation is a suggestion made by chandler, and monica's response is a reaction to it. 
         - common knowledge: it is common knowledge that a ""merge"" sign over a bed would be unusual and impractical, making monica's initial response of ""oh my god i love that!"" unlikely to be genuine. 
         - special symbols: there are no special symbols in this text, but the use of an exclamation mark after ""oh my god i love that!"" and ""no!"" adds to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"the correct label is 'sarcastic'. the cues that support this label are:

        1. rhetorical device: the use of the phrase ""oh my god i love that!"" is an exaggeration and irony, implying the opposite of what the words literally mean.

        2. surface emotion: the phrase ""oh my god i love that!"" initially suggests a positive emotion, but the subsequent ""no!"" reveals the true emotion of sarcasm and annoyance.

        3. language style: the sudden shift in tone and language from enthusiasm to negativity is characteristic of sarcastic language.

        the label is sarcastic. here's why:

        * rhetorical devices: the use of ""josephine"" instead of joey is a form of irony and sarcasm, as it is an unusual and formal way to address someone who is a friend.
        * language style: the tone is informal and playful, but with a hint of annoyance, which is typical of sarcasm.
        * topic: the topic of knitting pot holders is unusual and may be perceived as unmanly, which could lead to sarcasm.
        * special symbols: none
        * cultural background: the cultural context of friends hanging out and engaging in an unusual activity may contribute to the sarcastic tone.",1.0,"i would assign the label 'sarcastic' to the input text. here's why:
        the input text contains several cues that suggest sarcasm. 

        1. emotional words: the use of the name ""josephine"" instead of ""joey"" can be seen as a subtle way of mocking or being condescending, which is a sarcastic tone.

        2. special symbols: the exclamation mark after ""no thanks"" adds emphasis to the sentence, which can be seen as a way of expressing irony or sarcasm.

        3. surface emotion: the surface emotion of the sentence appears to be one of politeness or refusal, but the tone is actually sarcastic.

        4. emotional contrasts: the contrast between the surface emotion of politeness and the actual tone of sarcasm creates a sense of irony, which is a characteristic of sarcasm.

         the use of the phrase ""treat for the eyes and the ears"" is a clear example of sarcasm. the language style is also informal, which is typical of sarcastic tone. additionally, the context of the conversation suggests that chandler is being facetious, as monica asked for his opinion and he responded with a snarky comment. there is no surface emotion expressed, but the tone is unmistakably sarcastic. there are no special symbols or cultural background cues in this example, but the use of rhetorical devices like irony and hyperbole are present. overall, the label of this input is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic 

        the context and common knowledge help in identifying the sarcastic tone. chandler is making a comment about monica's haircut and the sarcastic tone is evident from the phrase 'treat for the eyes and the ears'. the use of the phrase 'treat for the eyes and the ears' is a common way to express sarcasm, implying that monica's haircut is not pleasing to look at or listen to.",1.0,1.0

        the language style of the input is informal and conversational, with a tone that implies the opposite of what is being said. the use of the phrase ""i really don't wanna"" is a rhetorical device that indicates sarcasm, as it is an obvious understatement. the cultural background of the reference to allen iverson, a famous basketball player, adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that sitting with him would be a bad thing. the common knowledge that allen iverson is a celebrity and not someone you would typically sit with in a mundane situation also adds to the sarcasm. overall, the input is labeled as sarcastic.",1.0,"sarcastic

        the cue ""really don't"" in the sentence is a keyword that can indicate sarcasm, but it is not enough on its own to classify the sentence as sarcastic. the context and topic of the conversation also play a crucial role. the previous sentence ""wish i could switch with someone"" implies that chandler does not want to sit with someone, which is a negative sentiment. the mention of allen iverson's name in the current sentence is a topic that adds to the context, implying that chandler is not a fan of iverson or does not want to sit with him. the sentence structure and the tone of the sentence also suggest sarcasm. therefore, considering all the cues, the correct label for this sentence is 'sarcastic'.",1.0,"sarcastic
