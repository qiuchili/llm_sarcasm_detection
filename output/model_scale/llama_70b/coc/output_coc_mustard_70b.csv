        let's break it down step by step.

        step 2: upon closer inspection, it appears that the speaker is being facetious. the sentence structure and word choice, such as ""hmm. that's too bad"" and ""waiting for the ball to drop"", suggest a hint of irony and mockery. the speaker is likely being sarcastic about the idea of waiting for the ball to drop on new year's eve.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the speaker's tone is the opposite of what they're saying. they're not actually disappointed about missing the ball drop, but rather, they're poking fun at the idea of doing so. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        ### reasoning:

        step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be positive and romantic, with phrases like ""wants to take your pants off"", which implies excitement and attraction.

        step 2: however, the sentence is quite unusual and unexpected, and it's unlikely that someone would say this in a genuine romantic context. the phrase ""my limbic system"" is also a scientific term, which sounds out of place in a romantic declaration. this suggests that the speaker is being ironic or sarcastic.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it's clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. the unusual language and phrasing are meant to be humorous or ironic, rather than a genuine expression of romantic interest.",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be positive, as indicated by the enthusiastic tone and the use of ""yes yes"".

        step 2: however, considering the context of the sentence, specifically ""in prison!!"", it is likely that the speaker is being sarcastic, implying that the situation is not desirable at all.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the speaker's intention is opposite of what the surface sentiment suggests, which indicates sarcasm. therefore, the label should be ""sarcastic"".",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment of this sentence seems to be neutral. there are no emotional keywords or sentimental phrases that convey a strong sentiment.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### explanation:
        in this case, the surface sentiment of the sentence is positive. the phrase ""whole package"" has a positive connotation, implying that the person being referred to has many desirable qualities.

        in step 2, we need to consider whether there are any indications of sarcasm or irony. the sentence is spoken in the context of a conversation, which suggests that it might be a response to someone else's statement. the phrase ""sounds like"" at the beginning of the sentence also implies a sense of skepticism or doubt. this, combined with the overly positive language, suggests that the speaker might be being sarcastic.

        therefore, in step 3, we can conclude that the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        step 2: the sentence is a response to an unknown previous statement, but it seems to be an ironic or humorous way of saying that the previous statement is obvious or inevitable. the use of ""yeah either that or"" and the reference to a song lyric gives it a playful tone.

        step 3: the difference between the surface sentiment and the true intention is what makes this sentence sarcastic. the speaker is not actually expressing enthusiasm or agreement, but rather using irony to convey that the previous statement is obvious or ridiculous. the tone is playful, but the intention is sarcastic.",1.0

        ### reasoning:
        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive, indicated by the phrase 'oh tons' which implies excitement or enthusiasm, and 'quite the woodsman' which implies being skilled or proficient.
        step 2: however, the sentence is likely to be sarcastic because chandler's tone is ironic and mocking, implying that he is not really a skilled woodsman. the use of the phrase 'oh tons' is exaggerated and the phrase 'quite the woodsman' is a clear overstatement.
        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, the true intention behind the sentence is the opposite of the surface sentiment, which is sarcastic. therefore, the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        ### Response:

        ### Label:

        ### explanation: 

        step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be suggesting that someone lacks self-control or judgment, which is a negative sentiment.

        step 2: however, the sentence is phrased in a way that implies the speaker is being facetious and ironic. the phrase ""if only"" is often used sarcastically to express the opposite of what it literally means. the speaker is likely saying this to someone who has already shown self-control or judgment, and the sentence is meant to be humorous or ironic.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the sentence is meant to be sarcastic. the speaker is using irony to express a positive sentiment (i.e., that the person has self-control or judgment) while literally saying the opposite. therefore, the correct label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        ### reasoning:

        following the step-by-step approach, let's analyze the given text.

        step 1: the surface sentiment of ""ok!"" seems neutral or slightly positive, indicating agreement or acknowledgement.

        step 2: the true intention behind ""ok!"" is likely to indicate agreement or acknowledgement, as there are no apparent rhetorical devices or language styles that suggest sarcasm.

        the surface sentiment of the sentence ""really!?"" is one of excitement and surprise. however, given the context and the tone, it is clear that rachel is being sarcastic. the use of ""really!?"" in an exclamatory tone, with a question mark at the end, implies that she is being facetious and does not actually believe what she is saying. therefore, the true intention behind the sentence is one of sarcasm. comparing step 1 and step 2, we can infer that the final sarcasm label is indeed sarcastic.",1.0

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, we can see that the surface sentiment is negative, but the true intention is to express frustration or annoyance, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

         ### explanation: 

         i will follow the step by step approach as i'm not 100% confident in my judgment. 

         step 1: the surface sentiment of this sentence seems to be agreement or acceptance. the words ""okay"" and ""i do not always have to be"" indicate a sense of compliance. 

         step 2: however, the repetition of ""okay"" and the phrase ""i do not always have to be"" seem awkward and insincere. this might be a case of verbal irony, where the speaker is saying the opposite of what they really mean.

the given response is sarcastic.

here's the step-by-step breakdown:

step 1: the surface sentiment is negative, indicated by the word ""not"" and the tone of disappointment.

step 2: however, the sentence ""all right, okay, well, apparently not!"" sounds like a response to something, and the use of ""apparently"" suggests that the speaker is being facetious. the tone is more playful and mocking than genuinely disappointed.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it's clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. they're not actually upset or disappointed; they're just poking fun at the situation or the person they're responding to.

so, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

         step 1: the surface sentiment of the sentence is neutral, with no obvious sentimental keywords or phrases. 

         step 2: upon closer inspection, the true intention of the sentence is likely to be sarcastic. the speaker is probably saying this to chloe because they want to get away from the guys, rather than actually thinking the guys have a crush on her. the sentence has a tone of annoyance and reluctance, implying that the speaker doesn't actually believe what they're saying.

        i chose the label 'sarcastic' because the sentence has a surface-level positive sentiment (""very nice""), but the tone and context suggest irony and mocking. the phrase ""well well, look what you brought"" is often used in a sarcastic tone to express disappointment or surprise, and the phrase ""very nice"" is likely being used to convey the opposite of its literal meaning. the speaker is probably being facetious and doesn't genuinely think what joey brought is ""very nice"".",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive, with phrases like 'best time ever' and 'rocked my world'. however, the tone seems off due to the initial 'nooo!' and the excessive use of superlatives.

        step 2: the true intention behind the sentence is likely to be the opposite, expressing disappointment, frustration, or annoyance. the speaker might be being facetious or ironic, using phrases that typically convey enthusiasm but actually mean the opposite.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it becomes clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. the exaggerated language and the initial negative phrase 'nooo!' suggest that the speaker is not genuinely expressing excitement or enthusiasm. therefore, the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        ### reasoning: 

        step 1: the surface sentiment of the sentence seems to be positive and playful, as indicated by the use of the phrase ""venus fly trap"" which is a unique and whimsical idea. 

        step 2: however, considering the context of the conversation, it's likely that blanche asked for a specific type of plant, and dorothy's response is an absurd and impractical suggestion, implying that she's not taking blanche's request seriously. 

        step 3: the disparity between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests that the sentence is sarcastic. dorothy is being facetious and mocking blanche's request, rather than providing a genuine suggestion.",1.0

step 2: however, the sentence implies that jimmy swaager should be able to cover his motel bill, which might not be the case. the use of ""can't"" instead of ""couldn't"" and the context of the situation suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic and mocking jimmy swaager's financial situation.

step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, the sentence's surface neutrality contrasts with its true intention of mocking, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the sentence is meant to be sarcastic. the speaker's use of irony and exaggeration indicates that they're being facetious and not serious. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        step 2: however, the sentence is likely to be sarcastic because it's a rhetorical question, implying that there are no men or that they are scarce, but the speaker doesn't actually expect an answer. the tone is also slightly exaggerated, which is a common trait of sarcasm.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the speaker is being facetious and ironic, implying that there are plenty of men around, but they're not interested or not worth noticing. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        the surface sentiment of the sentence is positive, as indicated by the phrase ""this is so good"" and the enthusiastic tone. however, upon closer examination, it's clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. the sentence is overly dramatic and the phrase ""i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my desert"" is an obvious exaggeration. the use of the word ""whilst"" also adds to the sense of irony. the true intention of the speaker is likely to express frustration or annoyance, rather than genuine excitement. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment is somewhat negative, with phrases like ""struck down in the prime of life"" which implies a sense of tragedy. 

        step 2: however, the context and tone of the sentence, particularly the use of ""really?"" at the beginning, suggests that the speaker is being facetious and ironic. the sentence is likely a response to some unexpected event, and the speaker is expressing mock surprise and drama. 

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the speaker's tone is sarcastic, as they are using irony to express their annoyance or frustration, rather than genuinely lamenting the situation. therefore, the label should be ""sarcastic"".",1.0
