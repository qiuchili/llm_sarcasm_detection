        ","sarcastic

        ### reasoning:

         step 1: the surface sentiment of this tweet appears to be a neutral or slightly positive request for help, as indicated by the phrase ""can u help?"" and the inclusion of a url.

         step 2: however, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the tweet is actually a sarcastic comment about conservatives being paid to post certain content on social media. the use of the phrase ""more conservatives needed"" and the mention of getting paid for posting certain content suggests that the author is being facetious.

         step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the tweet is actually sarcastic, as the author is using irony to express their disapproval of the situation. the tone is mocking and critical, rather than genuinely requesting help or support. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive, indicated by the phrase ""hahahaha"" and the hashtag ""#irony"". the phrase ""just walked in to #starbucks"" is neutral.

        step 2: the true intention is to express irony and sarcasm. the speaker asks for a ""tall blonde"" which is a coffee size, but it is also a phrase that can be used to describe a person. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly indicates that the speaker is being ironic.

        step 2: however, the sentence structure and phrase ""my favorite kind of people"" is often used to express irony or sarcasm. the phrase ""just stop worrying about it"" is also a common phrase used to belittle people with anxiety, which implies that the speaker is actually frustrated or annoyed with such people.

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, it's clear that the sentence is using irony and sarcasm to express the opposite sentiment of what's explicitly stated. the speaker is actually criticizing people who tell people with anxiety to ""just stop worrying about it"". therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the surface sentiment of the sentence appears to be positive, with keywords like ""classy,"" ""sassy,"" and the phrase ""never trashy."" the tone seems to be upbeat and confident.

**step 2: true intention**
upon closer examination, i notice that the sentence structure and language style are somewhat ironic. the use of ""always"" and ""never"" creates a sense of exaggeration, which might be a hint of sarcasm. additionally, the phrase ""just a little sassy"" could be interpreted as an understatement or a tongue-in-cheek comment.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, i infer that the sentence is actually sarcastic. the speaker might be poking fun at the idea of being ""always classy"" or using irony to convey the opposite meaning. the tone is playful, but the language suggests a hint of mockery.

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive, as indicated by the keywords ""thanks"", ""tribute"", and the phrase ""this young lady gospel singer"", which convey gratitude and admiration.

        step 2: however, upon closer inspection, the sentence structure and language style seem insincere and exaggerated. the phrase ""i'm about to research her & post my tribute"" sounds like an unlikely action, and the tone is overly effusive.

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, i infer that the true intention behind the sentence is ironic and mocking, rather than genuinely appreciative. therefore, the final label is:

        step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be neutral or slightly negative due to the word 'didn't get the memo', which implies a sense of disappointment or frustration.

        step 2: however, the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the speaker is being sarcastic. the phrase 'guess they didn't get the memo' is likely being used in a facetious manner, implying that the event was predictable or obvious.

        step 3: the disparity between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic. the hashtag #sarcasm serves as a clear indicator of the speaker's sarcastic tone. therefore, the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        ","let's go through the steps to make a more accurate judgment.

step 1: the surface sentiment of this sentence appears to be curious and inquiring. there are no obvious sentimental phrases or emojis that would indicate sarcasm.

step 2: the sentence seems to be asking a genuine question about the holiday rituals of true africans. however, the phrase ""true africans"" might be a hint of skepticism or even sarcasm, as it's a vague term and the speaker might be implying that there's no such thing as a ""true african.""

step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, while the surface sentiment appears to be genuine, the language style and the use of the phrase ""true africans"" suggest that there might be some underlying sarcasm or irony. however, it's not overtly sarcastic, and the tone is more inquiring than mocking.

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive due to the word ""#yay"", which is an enthusiastic and celebratory term.
        step 2: however, the context of being at the er since 10 is not a positive or celebratory situation. the ""#not"" hashtag at the end also implies that the opposite of what is being said is true.
        step 3: therefore, the true intention is the opposite of the surface sentiment, which is negative and complaining. this is a classic example of sarcasm, where the speaker is expressing frustration and annoyance at being stuck in the er.",1.0

         ### reasoning (optional, if you think step by step):
         step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be neutral, as there's no obvious emotional tone.
         step 2: however, the sentence implies a comparison between the two groups, which is not necessary for the given context, implying that the author is being facetious.

        ### Response:

        ### Label:

        ### explanation:
        step 1: the surface sentiment of the text appears to be negative and aggressive, with words like ""destroy"" and ""weaknesses"".
        step 2: however, upon closer examination, the tone seems exaggerated and ironic, especially with the hashtag #sarcasm. the phrase ""figuring out ur weaknesses"" is unlikely to be a genuine threat.
        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it's clear that the text is meant to be humorous and ironic, rather than a genuine threat, hence the label of sarcastic.",1.0

         step 1: the surface sentiment is neutral, as the question seems to be genuinely asking about nato's expansion.

         step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, i think the sentence is more likely to be sarcastic, as the question is phrased in a way that suggests the author already knows the answer and is being facetious.

        step 2: the use of '#irony' and the hashtag '#parttimecooks' suggests that the speaker is being facetious. the phrase 'on my way to #work' could be an exaggeration or a complaint, rather than a genuine statement.

        step 1: the surface sentiment is negative, as indicated by the keyword ""ranted"", ""#greatmorning"" (with a heavy dose of irony), and ""#not"". the sentimental phrase ""just died"" also implies frustration.

        step 2: however, considering the context and the use of irony, it's clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. the hashtag ""#greatmorning"" is particularly telling, as it's meant to convey the opposite of what it literally says.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can infer that the speaker is being sarcastic. the tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the use of irony and exaggeration further reinforces this conclusion. therefore, the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        step 3: the strong negative tone in step 1 contrasts with the possible ironic intention in step 2. this contrast suggests that the sentence is sarcastic, as the speaker is using strong words to express their frustration, but not literally meaning to call themselves stupid. the label is therefore 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, it's clear that the author's intention is to express frustration and annoyance in a sarcastic tone. the true intention is to criticize the reporting, not to make a genuine suggestion about what the newspaper should cover. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive, indicated by keywords like ""favourite book"", ""couldn't put it down"", ""5stars!"" and an enthusiastic tone.

        step 2: however, the sentence is written in an exaggerated tone, with an excessive use of superlatives (""favourite book"", ""couldn't put it down"") and an overly enthusiastic tone. this suggests that the speaker might be being ironic or sarcastic.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, i infer that the final label is 'sarcastic'. the speaker is probably being facetious and doesn't really think the book is their favourite.

        step 2: however, the phrase 'only a true nightshift person would understand this' seems a bit exaggerated, and the hashtag '#not' is suspicious. the sentence might be saying that only a nightshift person would understand the struggles or difficulties of working at night, rather than boasting about it.

        step 2: the sentence means the speaker is frustrated that chris brown keeps doing something wrong, which makes it hard for the speaker to like him. 
        the use of ""royally eff that up"" and ""chronic loose cannon"" emphasizes the speaker's annoyance.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### explanation:

        step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be negative, as the language used is aggressive and derogatory. the hashtags #defo, #not, #pissed, #off, and #nope seem to suggest the opposite, implying a positive or neutral sentiment.

        step 2: upon closer examination, the tone and language suggest that the speaker is being facetious and ironic. the excessive use of derogatory language and the hashtags that contradict the tone indicate that the speaker is being sarcastic.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their anger or frustration. the hashtags are meant to be ironic and convey the opposite of their literal meaning. therefore, the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

        i chose the label 'sarcastic' because:
        step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be playful and humorous, indicated by the use of the phrase 'not you' and the laughing emoji.
        step 2: however, upon closer inspection, it appears that the sentence is actually excluding someone from a criticism or negative comment, implying that the speaker is making a joke at someone else's expense.
        step 3: the contrast between the playful surface sentiment and the underlying negative intention reveals the sarcastic tone. the use of the phrase 'not you' is a rhetorical device that adds to the sarcasm, implying that the speaker is being facetious.",1.0

         step 1: the surface sentiment is negative, with the keyword 'not okay' and the phrase 'racist jokes', indicating disapproval.
         step 2: however, the sentence structure and tone suggest that the speaker is being facetious, implying that they are actually okay with the racist jokes. the phrase 'so not okay' is a common idiomatic expression used to convey irony or sarcasm.
         step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, we can conclude that the sentence is sarcastic, as it expresses the opposite of what the speaker truly means. the speaker is being sarcastic by saying they are not okay with the racist jokes when, in reality, they might be okay with them or even find them amusing.",1.0

        step 2: upon closer analysis, the sentence structure and language used seem to be more dramatic and attention-seeking than genuinely sad. the use of hyperbole (""giving up a lot of stuff"") and the focus on appearance rather than actual emotional pain suggest that the speaker might be seeking sympathy or attention rather than expressing genuine emotions.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it appears that the speaker's tone is more sarcastic and attention-seeking than genuinely sad or introspective. the use of the crying emoji also seems more like an attempt to manipulate emotions rather than an expression of genuine sadness.

        step 2: however, the sentence structure, the use of the phrase ""i see the #irony"", and the exaggerated tone of ""my last 3 tweets combined"" suggest that the author is being facetious and ironic. the true intention is likely to express frustration or annoyance in a humorous way.

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, the surface sentiment is negative, but the true intention is to be sarcastic and ironic, so the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

         step 1: the surface sentiment of this text is negative, as indicated by the keywords ""pissing me off"" and phrases expressing frustration.
         step 2: however, the sentence may not be entirely literal. the speaker might be exaggerating their frustration to emphasize their point. the phrase ""no idea of what's going on"" could be an overstatement.
         step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, i infer that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their frustration. the exaggerated language suggests that they don't literally believe the refs have no idea what's going on, but rather that they're making mistakes. the final label is therefore sarcastic.",1.0

        step 2: however, upon closer inspection, the sentence seems to be describing a poor educational environment. the use of the phrase ""royal accommodation"" is likely ironic, implying that the living conditions are far from luxurious. the hashtags ""#whatmoredoesoneneed"" and ""#education"" may be used sarcastically to express frustration or disappointment with the current state of education.

        i choose the label 'sarcastic' because the sentence 'it's international human rights day #irony' seems to have a sarcastic tone. 
        here is my step-by-step analysis:

        step 1: the surface sentiment is neutral or even positive (international human rights day sounds celebratory), 
        but the presence of '#irony' suggests that something is amiss.

        step 2: the true intention behind the sentence is that the speaker is being facetious or ironic, implying that 
        the concept of international human rights day is not being upheld or is being violated in some way.

        step 3: by comparing the surface sentiment (positive) with the true intention (negative/ironic), i infer that the sentence is indeed sarcastic.",1.0

        ","i will follow the step-by-step approach, as my confidence in my judgment is less than 90%.

        step 1: the surface sentiment of the sentence is neutral, as it simply states two actors are in a place and the user is going there. however, the presence of hashtags #not and #sonot suggests a possible negative sentiment.

        step 2: the sentence seems to imply that something is not fine, despite the user saying #everythingisfine. this could be an example of irony, where the user is expressing the opposite of what they really mean. the hashtags #not and #sonot further reinforce this idea.

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, it appears that the surface sentiment is opposite of the true intention. the user is actually expressing concern or unease, but saying the opposite. therefore, i infer that the final sarcasm label is sarcastic.

        this tweet appears to be sarcastic. the use of the hashtag '#irony' is a clear indication of sarcasm. the phrase 'if marathi man speak hindi to chu*** samajhte hai' is a statement that is opposite of what the speaker truly means, which is that people from marathi don't understand hindi. the speaker is being facetious and ironic by saying the opposite of what they truly believe, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive or neutral. the text seems to be sharing an interesting news article with hashtags #irony and #capitalism, which do not directly convey a strong sentiment.

        step 2: however, upon closer inspection, the text implies that people fought over tvs on black friday and are now struggling to sell them, which is an ironic and perhaps ridiculous situation. the hashtags #irony and #capitalism are used to highlight the absurdity of the situation. the true intention is to mock or criticize the consumerist behavior on black friday.

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, the surface sentiment is neutral, but the true intention is sarcastic, implying that the author is being ironic and critical of the situation. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        step 2: the sentence is actually criticizing the group guardiansofpeace for threatening to destroy peace, which is an ironic and contradictory action. the use of the word ""irony"" explicitly indicates the speaker's intention to highlight this contradiction.

        step 1: the surface sentiment is negative. the phrase ""but i guess you are not one"" implies a negative sentiment.

        ### reasoning:
        
        step 1: the surface sentiment of this tweet seems to be expressing excitement or hyperness with the use of the word ""hyper"" and the enthusiastic tone of the hashtags ""#ohwhale"" and the emojis ""🐋🐳"". 

        step 2: however, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the speaker is actually frustrated or annoyed because they should be resting at 1am but are not, implying that they are not actually ""hyper"" and are instead tired. the use of the phrase ""when i really should be getting rest"" suggests that the speaker is aware of their responsibilities and is not actually excited to be awake.

        step 3: the contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests that the tweet is sarcastic, as the speaker is using irony to express their frustration. the tone of the tweet is playful, but the underlying message is one of annoyance and frustration. therefore, the label should be ""sarcastic"".",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive as indicated by the word ""better"".

        step 2: however, the sentence seems to imply that the speaker is not satisfied with the result, which is only ""three minutes"". this could be a case of understatement, implying that the speaker was expecting more. the tone of the sentence is somewhat disappointed or frustrated.

        step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, i infer that the final sarcasm label is 'sarcastic'. the speaker is being sarcastic by saying that three minutes is better than no minutes, implying that it's not good enough.

         ### reasoning: 

         step 1: the surface sentiment of the text is negative, as indicated by the word ""definitely not"". this phrase suggests that the speaker is strongly denying something.
         step 2: however, the rest of the sentence is stating a very serious and critical point about racism being systematic and entrenched in american institutions. this is not something that would be denied in a serious conversation, which makes the initial ""definitely not"" phrase suspicious.
         step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, it is likely that the speaker is being sarcastic, using irony to express the opposite of what they really mean. the speaker is probably emphasizing the importance and truth of the statement about racism, rather than denying it. the use of ""definitely not"" is a way to highlight the absurdity of denying the existence of systemic racism. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        ### reasoning: 

        i chose the label 'sarcastic' because the sentence has a clear sarcastic tone. 

        step 1: the surface sentiment of the sentence is negative, with words like 'annoying' and 'needs babied and a bath', which suggests that the speaker is unhappy with the bluetick.

        step 2: however, the sentence also contains the hashtag '#sarcasm', which indicates that the speaker is being ironic and sarcastic. the phrase 'needs babied and a bath' is also an exaggeration, implying that the speaker is being facetious.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. the negative words and phrases are used to convey the opposite meaning, i.e., that the speaker is proud of the bluetick. the hashtag '#sarcasm' further reinforces this interpretation.",1.0

         step 2: however, i notice that the tweet is addressed to a specific person (@sherrodbcsn) and the phrase ""for the brothers"" seems somewhat out of place. it could be a genuine expression of camaraderie, but it may also be used in a sarcastic tone to imply the opposite.

         step 3: comparing step 1 and step 2, i'm still unsure, but i'm leaning towards 'sarcastic' as the tone seems slightly off. the use of ""ah-ite"" and ""for the brothers"" might be over-the-top or insincere, suggesting sarcasm.

        step 2: however, the joke relies on the listener being familiar with mike smith and brian hoyer, who are nfl players known for making mistakes. the phrase ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" is a clear exaggeration and a reversal of expectations, implying that they're trying to deflect blame. this is a common trope in sarcasm, where the speaker says the opposite of what they mean.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it's clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. they're using irony and exaggeration to poke fun at the players' tendency to shift blame. the hashtags #coyotes and #browns further support this interpretation, as they're likely referencing the teams the players are associated with. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

         step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be neutral, as the sentence simply states a fact about someone discovering they have a tail and it being fun to play with.
         step 2: however, the sentence is clearly absurd, as humans do not have tails. the use of the phrase ""someone discovered"" and the link to a fictional source (http://t.co/szkw1assrt) suggests that the sentence is meant to be humorous and ironic.
         step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the sentence is sarcastic, as it is using irony and absurdity to convey a humorous tone.",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment is negative, with phrases like ""you would think"", ""i guess not"" indicating disappointment or frustration.

        step 2: the sentence seems to be saying that the speaker expected white to get some action in the game, but it's not happening. however, the tone is not straightforward. the use of ""you would think"" and ""i guess not"" implies a sense of irony or sarcasm, suggesting that the speaker doesn't really think white should get action.

        ### reasoning: 

        this is a sarcastic tweet. here is the step-by-step analysis:
        
        step 1: the surface sentiment of this tweet appears to be negative, with the use of the phrase ""growing into some kind of beasts"" which has a negative connotation. the sad face emoji :( also suggests a negative sentiment.

        step 2: however, the phrase ""you got the point"" at the beginning of the tweet suggests that the author is being facetious or ironic. the use of ""yes"" at the beginning also implies a sense of sarcasm.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the author is being sarcastic. the negative sentiment expressed in the tweet is not genuine, but rather a way of expressing frustration or annoyance in a humorous way.",1.0

        step 2: the sentence structure and language style suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic. the use of ""yay"" and ""isn't that fun"" in a situation where someone took their lucky hat is unlikely to be genuine enthusiasm. the tone is more likely to be one of annoyance or frustration.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the sentence is meant to be sarcastic. the speaker is not happy about their hat being taken, and the hashtags #sarcasm and #ihopeigetitback further reinforce this interpretation.",1.0

        step 2: upon closer examination, it appears that the speaker is making a joke about being ""necrophelic"" after a latin final exam, implying that they are not actually interested in dead things. the hashtag ""#notintodeadthings"" further reinforces this interpretation.
        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their relief or humor about completing the exam. the use of irony and exaggeration in the joke indicates a sarcastic tone. therefore, the final label is 'sarcastic'.",1.0

         step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive, with the use of the word ""hardest"" which could be interpreted as a challenge or an accomplishment. however, the presence of the hashtag ""#screwyousmallparkinglot"" suggests a negative tone.

         step 2: the sentence structure and the use of the word ""probably"" suggest that the speaker is being facetious and that the parking lot is not impressive at all. the hashtag further reinforces this idea, implying that the speaker is being sarcastic about the difficulty of parking.

         step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the speaker is being sarcastic. the positive tone is meant to be ironic, and the hashtag provides a clear indication of the speaker's true feelings. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

         step 2: the true intention of the sentence is unclear, but the tone seems a bit off. the phrase ""person a x"" seems somewhat awkward and informal, which could suggest that the speaker is being insincere or ironic. additionally, the tone is overly polite, which could be a sign of sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

         ### explanation:

         step 1: the surface sentiment of this sentence seems to be sadness or respect, as indicated by the phrase ""rest in peace"" and the use of hashtags like #dimebag and #pantera, which refer to a famous guitarist.

         step 2: however, the sentence ""you can rest in peace"" is usually used to bid farewell to someone who has passed away. the hashtag ""#is #not #dead"" suggests that the person being referred to (dimebag darrell) is actually not dead. this implies that the sentence is being used in a sarcastic manner to express irony or frustration.

         step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can infer that the sentence is indeed sarcastic. the use of ""rest in peace"" is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to express a sense of irony or frustration. therefore, the final label is sarcastic.",1.0

        step 2: however, the tweet is responding to a situation that is supposed to be festive and joyful (christmas), and the author is making a comment that is opposite of what they truly mean. the use of ""that keeps the magic of xmas alive"" is an exaggeration and a clear indicator of sarcasm.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the author is being sarcastic. the negative sentiment on the surface is actually a manifestation of the author's frustration or annoyance, which is the opposite of what they are saying. therefore, the label should be ""sarcastic"".",1.0

        step 2: however, considering the context of the message, the phrase ""just trying to confuse you all"" suggests a sarcastic tone. the speaker is implying that their previous message was intentionally confusing, and the ""😘"" emoji is used to soften the tone.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the speaker is being sarcastic, as they are using irony to convey their message. the label is therefore ""sarcastic"".",1.0

        this tweet is sarcastic because it uses irony. the user quotes ""planned parenthood"" and says it has nothing to do with parenting, which is an obvious contradiction. the hashtags #irony and #oxymoron also suggest the user is being sarcastic. the surface sentiment is neutral, but the true intention is to mock the name ""planned parenthood"".",1.0

        step 2: however, the sentence structure and the use of hyperbole (""blood of those cops on their hands"") suggest that the speaker might be using irony and exaggeration to express their criticism. the tone is more aggressive and provocative than a genuine expression of responsibility.

        step 2: the true intention is to express frustration and disappointment with congress, but to do so in a sarcastic way by mentioning something positive (the stadium) that is not actually a good thing in this context.

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive, as indicated by the keyword ""horray"" and the emojis (💰💰👍😏), which suggest excitement and happiness.

        step 2: however, the sentence ""horray to working all weekend!"" is unlikely to be genuinely expressing excitement, as working all weekend is generally considered undesirable. the use of ""#sarcasm"" and ""#ohwell"" further reinforces this interpretation. therefore, the true intention is actually negative, expressing frustration or annoyance.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment (positive) with the true intention (negative), we can infer that the sentence is sarcastic, as the speaker is using irony to express the opposite of their true feelings.",1.0

        step 1: the surface sentiment is positive (due to the keyword 'haha' and the phrase 'guess my tweet was ok then' which indicates a casual and friendly tone).

        step 2: the true intention behind the sentence is ironic. the user is being sarcastic because they are implying that their tweet was not actually ok, but rather mediocre or bad. the tone of the sentence is playful, but it's meant to be ironic and slightly mocking.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic 

        ### reasoning: 

        step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be neutral or slightly positive due to the phrase ""i've got a right thirst on"" which implies the speaker wants to drink something. the hashtag #newsyearseve adds a celebratory tone.

        step 2: however, the phrase ""i've got a right thirst on"" is a common british slang expression meaning ""i'm extremely thirsty."" given the context of new year's eve, it's likely the speaker is being facetious about their desire for a drink, implying they've had too much to drink already.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, we can infer that the sentence is sarcastic. the speaker is expressing the opposite of what they really mean, which is that they're probably hungover or tired of drinking.",1.0

        ### reasoning (if confidence < 90%): 

         step 1: the surface sentiment is positive because of the keyword ""love"". 
         step 2: however, the sentence structure and the use of ""not"" in the hashtag ""#not"" suggest that the speaker is being ironic and actually unhappy about sleeping in late.

         ### reasoning:
         step 1: the surface sentiment of this sentence is negative, as the word ""kill"" implies harm or violence.

        (step 1) the surface sentiment seems to be negative and angry, as indicated by the phrase ""stick your head in the toilet and pull the..."". 
        (step 2) however, considering the context and the language style, it seems that the speaker is being facetious and ironic, implying that the headline is ridiculous or uninteresting.

        ### reasoning: 
        step 1: the surface sentiment seems to be neutral. 
        step 2: the phrase ""dog in the manger"" is an idiom that means to prevent others from having something, not because you want it, but because you don't want them to have it. in this context, it seems the speaker is accusing someone of being hypocritical. the use of ""#irony"" also implies that the speaker is being sarcastic.

        step 2: however, the sentence also contains ""oops"", which is an expression of mistake or error, and it's followed by a list of handles, which seems out of place in an excited or amused tone. this suggests that the sentence might be ironic or sarcastic.

        step 3: by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the sentence is being sarcastic. the use of ""roflmao"" is exaggerated and ironic, implying that the situation is actually frustrating or annoying rather than amusing.",1.0
