explanation: the text contains rhetorical devices such as repetition of the word ""however,"" direct quotation, and the use of the word ""crackpot"" to mock someone who holds a belief that is considered unrealistic. there are special symbols (such as ', ') used in the text to indicate a pause or a pause within a sentence. the context here is that doctors are misguided in recommending diets that are unrelated to scientific evidence. punctuation is used to clarify certain points in the text",1,sarcastic,1,sarcastic,1,1
