the input text is sarcastic because it uses rhetorical devices such as hyperbole (using exaggeration to make a point) and nonsense words (using non-related words together). the sentence ""you have a thing of paper clips right there"" is a nonsensical phrase that does not make practical sense in the c++ context. the use of the angry-sounding ""gosh"" and the incredulous ""i wish i'd known"" further convey the sarcasm.",1,sarcastic,1,1

explanation: the context in the first line, ""rose: are you depressed about glen?"" seems to imply that the speaker is talking about an event related to glen, but there is no corresponding spoken response, indicating that the speaker is not discussing such an event. the words ""depressed"" and ""glen"" seem to be sarcastic comments, because they indicate that the person is amused by the eventual outcome of the news. this is evident in the response by dorothy",1,sarcastic,1,sarcastic,1,1
