step 1: the sentence contains emojis, which suggests its surface sentiment is positive.
step 2: the sentence implies that finding a result or information difficult could be due to not being able to get information on time. it is not negative or sarcastic as a result. however, it is a bit figurative, so the sentiment is slightly down.
step 3: since step 2 contains no risible or shoot-down comments, it is less sarcastic and more straightforward.",1

### explanation:
the input text seems to be commenting on the arrest of a nfl rams player who was involved in the ""hands up, don't shoot"" protest in ferguson, missouri. there is no sarcastic language or emotive expressions, and the comment appears to be highlighting the player's actions rather than criticising them. therefore, the sarcasm label is 'not sarcastic'.

1. the surface sentiment of the text seems neutral as there are no strongly negative or affirmative words and the text does not include any sentimental phrases or emojis.
2. the text seems to be expressing encouragement and solicitation to follow a link. this indicates that the statement is generally true.
3. since the text is neutrally surface inspirational statement with a true intention of encouraging people to follow a url, it's a kind of motivational text rather than a sarcastic",1

### analysis:
the input text contains an example of sarcasm because it uses the word ""giddy glee"" which is usually associated with pretentious and absurd joy whereas the original picture of it implies genuine and enthusiastic joy, which results in a sarcastic situation reflecting an artificial sentiment. the sentence attempts to imply that darlamiles7 is sensitive about the misery of the royals by later showing affectionate behavior towards them, which is clearly absurd.
