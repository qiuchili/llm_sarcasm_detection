        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears positive on the surface
- ""can u help?"" suggests a friendly request
- ""get paid 4 posting"" implies a beneficial opportunity
- use of exclamation mark ""!"" indicates enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
- the message is actually promoting a political agenda
- ""more conservatives needed on #tsu"" indicates a specific ideological goal
- the offer to pay for posting suggests potential manipulation of social media
- the link provided likely leads to a platform for coordinated political messaging

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface tone is positive and helpful, the underlying intention is more calculated
- the tweet is not genuinely seeking help, but rather recruiting people for a political cause
- the enthusiasm is likely artificial, used to attract attention
- however, there's no clear indication of irony or mockery that would suggest sarcasm
- the tweet appears to be a straightforward, if somewhat deceptive, recruitment attempt

### Example:
Input: ""@outsilver87 @lasvegascapper ya, because if history has told us anything, it's that betting on sports is a great way to make money!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""ya"" (informal ""yes"") and ""great"" in all caps suggests strong agreement and enthusiasm.
- the phrase ""betting on sports is a great way to make money"" appears to be a positive statement about sports betting.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if history has told us anything"" is often used to introduce a contradictory statement.
- the exaggerated use of ""great"" in all caps hints at overstatement.
- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overly positive about sports betting.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""hahahaha"" indicates laughter and amusement
- the hashtag #irony suggests the author finds something ironic in the situation
- overall, the surface sentiment seems lighthearted and humorous

step 2: true intention
- ""tall blonde"" is a starbucks drink order, but it can also describe a person
- the author is likely amused by the double meaning of asking for a ""tall blonde"" in a coffee shop
- the #irony hashtag reinforces that the author is aware of and highlighting this double entendre

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of amusement aligns with the true intention
- the author is genuinely finding humor in the situation, not criticizing or mocking
- the sarcasm, if any, is very mild and more in the realm of wordplay or pun

given this analysis, while there's a play on words, it doesn't appear to be truly sarcastic in the sense of saying one thing and meaning the opposite. the humor is more straightforward.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""#not gonna win"" appears negative and defeatist on the surface
- the use of all caps adds emphasis to this negative statement
- there's a link included, but its content is not visible in the text alone

step 2: true intention
- the use of a hashtag suggests this might be a trending topic or phrase
- all caps could indicate strong emotion, but it's also commonly used for emphasis in social media, sometimes ironically
- the inclusion of a link implies there's additional context that we can't see, which could potentially contradict or modify the meaning of the text

step 3: comparison and analysis
- without seeing the content of the link, it's difficult to determine if there's a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention
- the phrase ""not gonna win"" could be genuine pessimism, or it could be sarcastic if the linked content shows something positive or successful
- the use of a hashtag and all caps is consistent with both sincere and sarcastic social media posts

given the limited information and the crucial role the unseen linked content might play in determining the intent, i can't confidently label this as sarcastic or not sarcastic. however, based on the potential for irony in the contrast between the text and the unknown linked content, i'm slightly inclined towards:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the text ""short hair"" is neutral.
- the hashtag ""#really"" could potentially indicate emphasis or skepticism.
- there's a link, which likely leads to an image or more information.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be a straightforward comment about short hair.
- the ""#really"" hashtag, in this context, likely emphasizes the short hair rather than expressing doubt or sarcasm.
- the link probably shows an image of the short hair being referred to.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

        ","given the content and structure of this input, i'm quite confident in my assessment. here's the label:

sarcastic

this tweet is clearly employing sarcasm through several indicators:

1. the excessive use of hashtags, particularly #sarcasm itself.
2. the contrast between positive phrases (""10/10"") and negative descriptors (""#boring"", ""#dead"", ""#shit"", ""#sleeping"").
3. the overuse of ""mate"" in a short text, which feels exaggerated.
4. the phrase ""can't handle the #sarcasm"" at the end, which explicitly points out the sarcastic nature of the entire tweet.

the author is using sarcasm to express that their work environment is actually very boring or unpleasant, contrary to the initial positive rating of ""10/10"". the excessive use of hashtags and repetitive language further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.",1.0

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""absolute favorite"" expresses strong positive sentiment
- ""corny jokes"" is typically seen as a negative or mildly disparaging term
- overall, the surface sentiment appears positive due to ""absolute favorite""

step 2: true intention
- ""corny jokes"" are generally considered unfunny or cheesy by most people
- expressing that corny jokes are an ""absolute favorite"" is unusual
- this could be a genuine preference, or it could be an ironic statement

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a potential mismatch between the typically negative perception of corny jokes and the strongly positive sentiment expressed
- this mismatch is a common indicator of sarcasm
- however, it's also possible that the speaker genuinely enjoys corny jokes
- without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to be certain

given the analysis, there's a strong possibility of sarcasm, but it's not definitive. however, based on the common use of such statements ironically, i'm leaning towards a sarcastic interpretation.

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:

- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough evaluation:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat neutral to slightly defensive:
- ""people complain"" suggests negative feedback from others
- ""all i feel is like"" indicates a relatively calm response
- the quote ""hey don't blame me"" seems to be a mild defense

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be mockery and sarcasm:
- the attribution to ""albert e"" (likely albert einstein) for a trivial matter about a background picture is absurd
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates the sarcastic nature of the post
- the juxtaposition of a petty complaint with a reference to a renowned scientist creates a humorous contrast

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of mild defense contrasts with the true intention of mockery. the author is using sarcasm to ridicule those who complain about something as insignificant as a background picture. the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag confirms this interpretation.

step 1: surface sentiment
- ""darn"" indicates mild disappointment or frustration
- the phrase ""needs fixing"" suggests something is wrong or inadequate
- the use of a question mark at the end creates an uncertain or questioning tone

step 2: true intention
- the context suggests this is likely a response to criticism or feedback about a joke
- the use of ""darn"" and the question format seem exaggerated or overly dramatic for a simple joke correction
- mentioning a ""sock joke"" in a conversation about joke-fixing hints at a playful or lighthearted tone

step 3: comparison and analysis

- the tweet expresses a negative sentiment with the phrase ""he's wrong"" and the angry devil emoji 👿
- it seems to imply that christian has an expectation that the speaker disagrees with
- the mention of ""fifa"" sleeping in the bed adds an unusual element

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely not meant to be taken literally
- ""fifa"" probably refers to the fifa video game, not a person
- the true intention appears to be a humorous comment about the speaker's partner (christian) wanting to play the fifa video game late into the night
- the speaker is expressing mild frustration or playful disapproval of this idea

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the surface sentiment (which seems serious) and the true intention (which is playful)
- the tweet uses exaggeration and personification (treating the video game as if it were a person who could sleep in the bed) for comedic effect
- the angry emoji is likely used ironically to emphasize the playful nature of the complaint

the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""favorite kind of people"" suggesting admiration or preference
- the use of ""#educateyourself"" could be seen as a positive call to action

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- criticizing people who give simplistic advice to those with anxiety
- the use of ""#not"" explicitly negates the previous statement
- ""#educateyourself"" in this context seems to be a criticism of those who lack understanding about anxiety

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface sentiment (appearing to praise these people) and the true intention (criticizing them). the use of ""favorite kind of people"" followed by ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is using false praise to emphasize their disapproval of people who trivialize anxiety.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll need to think through this step-by-step, as there's not enough context to make a confident judgment immediately.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement appears neutral to positive on the surface
- ""most important thing"" suggests significance and value
- ""i've learned in school"" implies educational benefit
- the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/tvfjmgblbh) suggests there's additional content to support or explain the statement

step 2: true intention
- without seeing the content of the linked image/page, it's difficult to determine the true intention
- the phrase ""most important thing"" could be genuine or exaggerated for effect
- the brevity of the text and reliance on external content could indicate that the true meaning is not fully expressed in the text alone

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the seemingly straightforward statement and the reliance on external content to convey the full message
- this could be indicative of sarcasm, where the linked content might contradict or humorously undermine the stated importance
- however, it could also be a genuine statement with supporting information in the link
- without seeing the linked content, it's impossible to determine with certainty whether this is sarcastic or not

given the ambiguity and the critical role of the unseen linked content, i cannot confidently label this as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. the final determination would heavily depend on the content of the link.",0.0

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

i'm confident in this judgment because:

1. the tweet expresses genuine excitement about the orion launch with the exclamation ""yeah!""

2. the use of the hashtag #orionlaunch suggests the user is actively following and interested in the event.

3. including a link (http://t.co/0qkv1yq8t0) implies the user wants to share more information about the launch, which is consistent with sincere enthusiasm.

4. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.

5. space launches are typically events that generate genuine excitement among space enthusiasts and the general public.

I love context and large ensemble Fridays!!!!! Der my most favourite #Sarcasm #GetTheFuckOut,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears extremely positive due to:
- ""i love"" expressing strong affection
- multiple exclamation marks (!!!!!) indicating excitement
- ""my most favourite"" suggesting high preference

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly stating the sarcastic nature
- ""#getthefuckout"" expressing strong frustration or dismissal
- ""der"" (likely meant to be ""they're"") used mockingly
- the exaggerated enthusiasm seems insincere given the context

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contradiction between the overly positive surface sentiment and the negative hashtags and language. the use of ""#sarcasm"" removes any ambiguity about the speaker's intent. the exaggerated positive language is being used to express the opposite sentiment, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- ""warm up the dj booth"" implies anticipation for music or performance

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step, as the context requires careful consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the message starts with ""liar"", which is a strong accusatory term
- the rest of the message refers to ""532 murders in chicago in 2012""
- the tone appears confrontational and defensive
- multiple twitter handles are mentioned, suggesting a public dispute or conversation

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""i've never denied"" suggests the speaker is responding to an accusation
- the mention of specific murder statistics implies the speaker is trying to prove a point or defend their position
- the multiple twitter handles indicate this is part of a larger conversation or argument
- the true intention seems to be to refute someone else's claim and assert the speaker's consistency or honesty

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (accusatory and defensive) aligns with the true intention (refuting a claim)
- however, the use of ""liar"" at the beginning, followed by a statement about never denying something, creates a contrast
- this contrast suggests the speaker might be using sarcasm to emphasize their point
- the exaggerated capitalization of ""liar"" further supports the possibility of sarcasm
- the overall tone and context suggest that the speaker is likely using sarcasm to mock or criticize the person/people they're responding to

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the input is somewhat ambiguous and requires careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet uses many hashtags, which can indicate enthusiasm or emphasis
- no clear positive or negative sentiment words
- the phrase ""not long to go"" could suggest anticipation
- mentions of ""mainstream media pitch"" and ""surgery"" don't provide clear emotional context
- overall, the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly positive due to the anticipatory tone

step 2: true intention
- the excessive use of hashtags for nearly every word is unusual and could be seen as mocking or exaggerating social media behavior
- the content seems to be about an upcoming media pitch and possibly a demonstration involving surgery
- the mention of ""prototype"" and ""real situation"" suggests a planned demonstration
- the abrupt ending with ""phil"" is odd and doesn't fit the formal tone of the rest of the tweet

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, the excessive hashtag use and the odd structure of the tweet suggest potential mockery
- the content itself doesn't appear to be sarcastic, but the presentation style could be interpreted as a satirical take on social media communication
- the discrepancy between the formal content and the exaggerated hashtag use creates a sense of incongruity, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm

given the analysis, there's a possibility of sarcasm in the presentation style, but it's not definitively clear. however, considering the exaggerated use of hashtags and the incongruity between style and content, i'm leaning towards classifying this as sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

i'm confident in this classification due to the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag at the end of the tweet. this is a clear indicator that the author intended the message to be interpreted as sarcastic.

the content of the tweet also supports this classification:

1. ""guess they didn't get the memo"" is a common sarcastic phrase implying someone has missed obvious or important information.

2. the reference to a ""non-nuclear baltic sea"" is likely contrasting with recent geopolitical tensions or concerns about nuclear threats in the region.

- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
- ""merry christmas"" is a positive, celebratory phrase
- the first part ""exam na jud"" is in a different language (likely filipino), so its sentiment is unclear without translation

step 2: true intention
- ""exam na jud"" likely means ""it's exam time"" or ""exams are coming""
- the juxtaposition of exam time with ""merry christmas"" seems odd and conflicting
- the hashtags ""#sarcasm"" and ""#killusslowly"" strongly indicate negative feelings and explicitly state sarcastic intent
- ""kill us slowly"" suggests suffering or distress related to the exams

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity of ""merry christmas"" contrasts sharply with the likely stress of upcoming exams
- the use of a celebratory phrase for a typically stressful situation (exams) indicates sarcasm
- the hashtags explicitly confirm the sarcastic nature and negative feelings behind the message

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

label: sarcastic

the explicit use of #sarcasm, the contrasting sentiments, and the negative implication of #killusslowly all strongly support this classification.",1.0
The definition of #IRONY would be if a 77-year-old rapper went #viral and took #BITCOIN mainstream. Maybe only way #babyboomers will buy in.,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral to slightly positive. the tweet discusses a hypothetical scenario of an elderly rapper going viral and bringing bitcoin to the mainstream, which is presented as an interesting or potentially beneficial outcome. the use of hashtags like #irony and #bitcoin adds emphasis but doesn't clearly indicate a positive or negative sentiment on their own.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be to point out the absurdity or unlikelihood of the scenario described. the tweet is using hyperbole and contrast to make a point:
- the idea of a 77-year-old rapper (contrasting age with a typically youth-oriented genre) going viral is unexpected.
- linking this unlikely scenario to bitcoin adoption by baby boomers further emphasizes the improbability.
- the use of ""maybe only way"" suggests skepticism about baby boomers adopting bitcoin through conventional means.
- the explicit mention of ""#irony"" at the beginning signals that the author is aware of the contradictory or unexpected nature of the scenario they're describing.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment doesn't immediately signal strong sarcasm, the true intention reveals a more complex message. the author is using irony to comment on the difficulty of getting older generations to adopt new technologies like bitcoin. the juxtaposition of unlikely elements (elderly rapper, viral fame, bitcoin mainstream adoption) creates a sarcastic tone that mocks the improbability of the scenario while also critiquing the reluctance of baby boomers to embrace cryptocurrency.

label: sarcastic

the analysis reveals that while not overtly negative, the tweet uses irony and unlikely scenarios to convey a sarcastic message about generational technology adoption, particularly regarding cryptocurrency.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

i'm confident in this judgment for the following reasons:

1. the phrase ""pretty excited"" contrasts sharply with the negative content of ""gave up on me,"" creating a clear mismatch between the stated emotion and the situation described.

2. the use of ""file under:"" followed by ""#sarcasm"" is an explicit indicator that the speaker is being sarcastic. the hashtag directly labels the statement as sarcasm.

3. the structure of the sentence, expressing excitement about a negative action (giving up), is a common sarcastic format used to express disappointment or hurt in a sardonic way.

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and somewhat critical. the use of hashtags like #hipsters and #brooklyn, along with references to ""irony"" and ""clinton years,"" suggests a commentary on cultural trends. the questions seem to be expressing genuine curiosity or concern about hipsters' understanding of history.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention is likely not genuine questioning but rather criticism and mockery. the questions are rhetorical, implying that hipsters should know better. the mention of ""used bookstores in #brooklyn"" is stereotyping hipster culture, and the overall tone is condescending.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface-level questioning conflicts with the underlying critical and mocking tone. the author is using rhetorical questions not to seek information but to express disapproval of hipster culture's perceived ignorance of history. the stereotyping and exaggerated assumptions about hipsters further reinforce the sarcastic nature of the text.

step 2: true intention
the ""#not"" hashtag at the end completely reverses the meaning of the statement. this is a common social media convention used to indicate sarcasm or irony. the true intention is likely to criticize or mock people who engage in social media drama, implying that such behavior is actually immature or undesirable, rather than making one look ""badass"".

step 3: comparison and analysis

- the ""general rule"" proposed is not actually a common or sensible rule.
- encouraging someone to stay up all night simply because a place is open 24 hours is not typically considered good advice.
- the casual tone and seemingly absurd suggestion hint at possible humor or sarcasm.

- the use of ""nooooooooooo"" with multiple 'o's suggests extreme dismay or frustration
- the exclamation ""again it's on!!!"" with multiple exclamation marks could indicate excitement
- the hashtags ""#pickanewsong"" and ""#cantstandit"" express negative sentiment towards a song

step 2: true intention
- the elongated ""nooooooooooo"" is likely an exaggerated expression of annoyance
- ""again it's on!!!"" is probably not genuine excitement, but frustration that something unwanted is happening again

- the exaggerated ""nooooooooooo"" and the seemingly excited ""again it's on!!!"" contrast with the clearly negative hashtags
- this contrast between the apparent excitement and the actual frustration is a hallmark of sarcasm

"Being a hipster now is so mainstream. Oh, the irony. #hipster #irony",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""oh, the irony"" typically expresses a sense of wry amusement or mild frustration. the use of hashtags #hipster and #irony seems straightforward and descriptive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to point out a contradiction or paradox. the statement ""being a hipster now is so mainstream"" deliberately combines two opposing concepts: hipsters (who typically pride themselves on being non-mainstream) and being mainstream. the follow-up ""oh, the irony"" explicitly calls attention to this contradiction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of mild amusement or frustration aligns with the true intention (step 2) of pointing out irony. however, the key to sarcasm here is in the deliberate contradiction presented in the first sentence. the author is using irony to mock the concept of hipsterism itself, suggesting that it has become so popular that it defeats its own purpose of being unique or alternative.

given this analysis, i can confidently label this as sarcastic.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the word ""exactly"" indicates agreement.
- ""fighting like animals"" is a negative phrase, suggesting conflict or aggression.
- overall, the surface sentiment appears negative due to the fighting reference.

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""exactly"" suggests the speaker is agreeing with a previous statement.
- ""we are fighting like animals"" could be an exaggeration to emphasize a point.
- the tone seems to be critical or disapproving of the fighting behavior.
- there's a possibility that the speaker is using irony to highlight the absurdity of the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a potential mismatch between the agreement (""exactly"") and the negative description that follows.
- the phrase ""fighting like animals"" is an idiom that's often used to criticize or express disappointment in human behavior.
- the context of agreeing and then immediately describing negative behavior could indicate sarcasm.
- however, without more context, it's difficult to be certain if this is genuine criticism or sarcastic commentary.

given the potential for irony in agreeing and then describing negative behavior, and the use of an exaggerated phrase ""fighting like animals,"" there's a reasonable chance this statement is sarcastic. however, it could also be a genuine criticism.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet contains a hashtag ""#teenanalcasting"" which is highly inappropriate and concerning
- it mentions ""sex and the city 2"" movie casting auditions, which on the surface appears to be about a legitimate film production
- no obvious sentimental phrases or emojis are present
- the surface sentiment is neutral to positive, as it seems to be sharing information about a casting opportunity

step 2: true intention
- the juxtaposition of the inappropriate hashtag with a mainstream movie franchise is jarring and likely intentional
- the true intention appears to be shock value or dark humor rather than sharing actual casting information
- it's possible this is a form of social commentary on the sexualization of young people in the entertainment industry
- alternatively, it could be spam or a malicious attempt to spread inappropriate content

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (seemingly neutral information about casting) and the likely true intention (shock, inappropriate humor, or malicious content)
- the use of the inappropriate hashtag alongside legitimate-sounding film information creates a disturbing contrast
- this contrast and mismatch suggest the tweet is not meant to be taken at face value

the surface sentiment appears negative due to words like ""stupid"" and the phrase ""gonna bury me,"" which suggest frustration or distress. the exclamation marks also emphasize strong emotion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration about frequent or expensive doctor visits. the use of ""#irony"" at the end is a key indicator that the author is pointing out a contradictory or unexpected situation - likely that doctor visits, which are supposed to help, are figuratively ""burying"" (overwhelming or financially burdening) them instead.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the addition of ""#irony"" suggests the author is deliberately highlighting the contradiction between the expected outcome of doctor visits (improved health) and the perceived result (being ""buried""). this use of irony, combined with the exaggerated language (""gonna bury me""), strongly indicates a sarcastic intent.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm
- the tweet likely means the joke was actually terrible or inappropriate, not genuinely good

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) and hashtags like ""#socute"" and ""#3moreweeks"" suggest excitement and affection. the idea of someone holding a sign at the airport is often associated with warm welcomes and anticipation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a mix of excitement and gentle mockery. while the speaker appears genuinely looking forward to the meeting in 3 weeks, the ""lol"" after mentioning the sign could indicate they find the idea slightly amusing or unnecessary. it might be seen as a bit over-the-top or cliché, but still appreciated.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while overall positive, the ""lol"" introduces a note of amusement that could be interpreted as light sarcasm. however, this doesn't seem to overshadow the genuine anticipation and affection expressed in the message.

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention

step 3: comparison and analysis

3. the exaggerated enthusiasm (""so much fun"") in this context likely indicates sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""only"" in all caps suggests emphasis or strong feeling
- no clear positive or negative sentiment words
- mentioning ""federal crime"" could imply seriousness

step 2: true intention
- the tweet seems to be making a statement about when crimes become federal crimes
- the capitalization of ""only"" implies there's just one specific situation when this happens
- multiple twitter handles are tagged, suggesting this is part of a conversation or debate
- the lack of context makes it difficult to determine if this is a factual statement or a critique

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment doesn't clearly align with or contradict the true intention
- the emphatic ""only"" could be interpreted as exaggeration, which is sometimes a marker of sarcasm
- however, without more context, it's difficult to determine if this exaggeration is meant sarcastically or just for emphasis
- the tweet could be a sincere (though possibly oversimplified) statement about federal crimes, or it could be a sarcastic comment on how federal crimes are determined

- ""peace and love"" reinforces a positive, idealistic message.
- the hashtag ""#kinglife"" could imply a sense of grandeur or importance.
- overall, the surface sentiment appears positive and idealistic.

step 2: true intention
- the statement about music being ""for the people and not for the money"" is a common cliché in the music industry.
- the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/jphid2p2wc) suggests promotional content, which seems at odds with the non-commercial sentiment.
- the phrase ""peace and love"" is often used genuinely but can also be employed sarcastically to mock hippie or overly idealistic attitudes.
- ""#kinglife"" could be interpreted as self-aggrandizing, potentially undermining the humble message.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a potential contradiction between the non-commercial sentiment and the inclusion of a promotional link.
- the use of clichéd phrases like ""for the people"" and ""peace and love"" alongside self-promoting elements like ""#kinglife"" creates a sense of insincerity.
- the combination of idealistic language with self-promotion suggests the speaker might be mocking or sarcastically employing these concepts.

- neutral statement about a rangers league game being moved
- hashtag ""#irony"" at the end

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""#irony"" suggests the author finds something contradictory or unexpected about the situation
- the petrofac cup is likely considered less important than a league game
- moving a league game (typically more important) for a cup final (typically less important) is seen as ironic

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface statement is factual and neutral
- the addition of ""#irony"" transforms the meaning, implying the author finds the situation ridiculous or contradictory
- the use of ""irony"" in this context is likely meant sarcastically, as the situation is more accurately described as inconvenient or frustrating rather than truly ironic

Been at the ER now since 10... #yay #not,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of ""#yay"", which typically expresses joy or excitement. however, the addition of ""#not"" at the end introduces ambiguity.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely one of frustration or annoyance. being at the er (emergency room) since 10 (presumably 10 pm or 10 am) suggests a long, unpleasant wait. the use of ""#yay"" followed by ""#not"" is a common way to express sarcasm, indicating that the situation is actually not enjoyable at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (""yay"") and the true intention (frustration with a long er wait). the use of ""#not"" explicitly negates the positive sentiment, confirming the sarcastic intent. this is a classic example of using contrasting elements to create sarcasm.

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement about a pet rat named haley enjoying a new hammock. here's my reasoning:

1. the sentiment is positive, with the word ""approves"" indicating satisfaction.
2. the use of the mouse emoji (🐭) is consistent with the subject matter (a pet rat).
3. the hashtag #ratsofinstagram is a common, genuine tag used by pet rat owners to share photos of their pets.
4. including a link to an image (http://t.co/yvggcapchg) suggests the user is sharing a photo of the described scene.
5. there are no indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.

the tweet appears to be a sincere share of a pet owner's enjoyment of their animal companion, which is common on social media platforms. therefore, i can confidently classify this as not sarcastic.",0.0

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

the surface sentiment appears positive in the second sentence, with phrases like ""brilliant job"" and ""done by the americans"". the first sentence, however, expresses a negative sentiment about lack of justice.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly critical and negative. the juxtaposition of the tragic event (bhopal gas tragedy) with the phrase ""brilliant job done by the americans"" is intentionally jarring. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the praise is not sincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment in the second sentence sharply contrasts with the true negative intention. this contrast, combined with the explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag, clearly indicates that the statement is meant to be understood as the opposite of what it literally says.

the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the exaggerated use of ""loooovvveeeeeee"" which typically expresses strong affection or enjoyment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly negative. several clues indicate this:
1. the situation described (phone getting wiped) is generally considered frustrating and undesirable.
2. the ""-.-"" emoticon represents a frustrated or annoyed expression.
3. the ""#not"" hashtag at the end explicitly negates the opening statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the exaggerated positive sentiment at the beginning (""loooovvveeeeeee"") and the true negative feeling about the situation. this mismatch, combined with the explicit negation (""#not""), is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the author is using overstatement and irony to emphasize their frustration with their phone being wiped.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement appears to be making a serious comparison between judging all police officers based on a few and racist logic.
- the use of ""#irony"" at the end suggests the author is pointing out a contradiction or unexpected similarity.
- no overtly positive or negative words are used; the tone seems neutral and matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
- the author is likely criticizing those who generalize about all police officers based on the actions of a few.
- by comparing this generalization to racist logic, the author is implying that such thinking is flawed and hypocritical.
- the ""#irony"" hashtag suggests the author finds it ironic that people who might oppose racism are using similar logic in their criticism of police.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface statement and the true intention align closely. the author is not saying one thing while meaning another.
- the use of ""#irony"" is not to indicate sarcasm in the statement itself, but to highlight the ironic nature of the situation being described.
- the statement is making a pointed observation about logical inconsistency, but it's not using sarcasm to do so.

- suggests the shift is extremely demanding

step 2: true intention
- an 11-2 shift is actually quite short (only 3 hours)

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

- the content describes a scenario of someone giving a negative review
- the phrase ""scathing, 1-star review"" indicates strong negative sentiment
- the use of ""ffs"" (an acronym for a frustrated expletive) shows irritation

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is pointing out the hypocrisy of criticizing someone's grammar while making grammatical errors oneself
- the author is emphasizing the importance of practicing what one preaches
- the use of ""rt"" indicates this is a retweet, showing agreement with the original poster's sentiment
- the hashtag ""#irony"" at the beginning explicitly states the author's view of the situation

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment describes a negative review situation, the true intention is to highlight the irony and absurdity of the described scenario
- the frustration expressed is not with the subject of the review, but with the reviewer's lack of self-awareness
- the use of ""#irony"" and the overall tone suggest the author is pointing out a ridiculous situation rather than making a straightforward statement

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the input is not straightforward:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no obvious sentiment keywords or emotional phrases. it appears to be a simple statement about producing mobile apps, followed by a hashtag ""#not"" and two urls.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is ambiguous but leans towards being contradictory to the surface statement. the hashtag ""#not"" is often used to negate or contradict the statement that precedes it. this suggests that the true intention might be to say they are not actually producing mobile apps.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a contradiction between the statement ""produce mobile apps"" and the hashtag ""#not"". this mismatch between the surface statement and the implied negation through the hashtag is a potential indicator of sarcasm. the use of ""#not"" to contradict the main statement is a common sarcastic device on social media.

given this analysis, i would classify this as:

- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention

- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

- it's presented as wisdom or advice.
- there's no overtly negative language.

step 2: true intention
however, several factors suggest a different true intention:

- the hashtag ""#irony"" is explicitly included, indicating the poster sees irony in the situation.
- using a quote about overcoming fear from someone who abused trust could be seen as deeply ironic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly inspirational quote and the context of its attribution, along with the explicit labeling of irony, strongly suggests sarcasm. the poster is likely using this quote to highlight the hypocrisy of cosby's public persona versus his private actions, or to comment on the irony of taking life advice from a discredited figure.

- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears positive.
- ""boosts my self-esteem"" is a clearly positive phrase.
- getting a question correct is generally seen as a positive achievement.

step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to be self-deprecating humor.
- the speaker is an adult (implied by their ability to comment on their self-esteem) comparing themselves to children.
- ""kids jeopardy"" is specifically mentioned, which is a version of the game show for children.
- the implication is that the speaker feels accomplished for matching the knowledge level of children.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the surface positive sentiment and the likely self-deprecating intention.
- the speaker is using the positive framing of ""boosting self-esteem"" to actually highlight that they perhaps shouldn't feel too proud about knowing answers meant for children.
- this juxtaposition of adult pride with child-level knowledge creates a humorous, self-mocking effect.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

itsfunny bc people think im quiet|but im just listening toeveryones convos|and figuring out ur weaknesses|todestroy u later in life #sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough evaluation:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat playful or humorous. the phrase ""itsfunny bc"" (it's funny because) suggests a lighthearted tone. the description of being quiet and listening to conversations could be seen as neutral or slightly positive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes darker as the text progresses. the phrases ""figuring out ur weaknesses"" and ""todestroy u later in life"" reveal a more sinister underlying meaning. this sharp contrast with the initial lighthearted tone is a strong indicator of sarcasm. additionally, the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the content as sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the mismatch between the initially playful tone and the increasingly malevolent content creates a sarcastic effect. the author is using sarcasm to humorously exaggerate the idea of a quiet person secretly plotting against others. the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" confirms the sarcastic intent.

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""is [she] all there?"", ""sounds blonde"", and hashtags ""#ignorant"" and ""#articulate minority"" suggest a disapproving tone towards the subject.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the tweet appears to be genuinely questioning the subject's intelligence and criticizing her understanding of race relations. there are no clear indicators of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. the tweet expresses a straightforward negative opinion without employing sarcastic devices like exaggeration, mock praise, or ironic contrast.

the surface sentiment appears positive and slightly amused. the tweet describes a productive morning routine, and ends with a laughing emoji (😅) which suggests a light-hearted tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing mild frustration or self-deprecating humor about unnecessarily preparing for work on a day off. the detailed description of the morning routine builds up to the realization that it was all unnecessary, which creates a humorous contrast.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears positive, the true intention reveals a ironic situation. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to highlight the irony of unnecessarily preparing for work. the laughing emoji at the end reinforces this interpretation, suggesting the author finds humor in their own mistake.

given this analysis, i believe this tweet is using gentle sarcasm to express the irony of the situation.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet is a question asking about jobs earning middle-class wages.
- the use of hashtags like #economics and #math suggests a serious, analytical approach.
- there's no overtly positive or negative sentiment expressed.

step 2: true intention
- the question ""how many of those jobs earn #middleclass wages?"" appears to be a genuine inquiry.
- however, the context (mentioning various media outlets and economists) and the use of hashtags like #economics and #math suggest the user might be implying that not many of the jobs actually pay middle-class wages.
- the hashtag #z at the end is unusual and could potentially be interpreted as dismissive or indicating skepticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward question, the true intention seems to be more complex.
- the question itself could be rhetorical, implying that few of the jobs mentioned actually pay middle-class wages.
- the combination of mentioning various media sources, economists, and using economics-related hashtags suggests the user might be critically questioning job quality claims.
- however, the sarcasm, if present, is subtle and not overtly expressed.

given the subtle nature of the potential sarcasm and the lack of clear sarcastic markers, i'm not entirely confident in labeling this as sarcastic. the tweet could be interpreted as a genuine inquiry or as a subtle critique.

I reckon straight women fancy victoria secret models more than straight men do #victoriasecret #irony,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward observation or opinion. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the hashtag #victoriasecret suggests a neutral reference to the brand. however, the inclusion of #irony at the end hints at a potential deeper meaning.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out a perceived contradiction or unexpected situation. the tweet suggests that straight women are more attracted to victoria's secret models than straight men, which goes against the common assumption that these models are primarily marketed to appeal to men. the use of ""i reckon"" gives it a casual, observational tone, but the #irony hashtag clearly indicates that the author sees this as an ironic situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears to be a simple observation, but the true intention is to highlight an ironic situation. the use of the #irony hashtag is a direct indicator that the author intends this tweet to be understood as ironic or sarcastic. the apparent contradiction between the expected audience (straight men) and the suggested actual audience (straight women) for victoria's secret models is the core of the sarcastic comment.

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but let me explain my reasoning:

the tweet appears to be genuinely praising and promoting content related to viktoria modesta, who is known for her work as an artist and performer with a prosthetic leg. the use of words like ""incredible insight"" and hashtags such as #equality and #movement suggest sincere support and admiration.

there are no contradictory elements or indicators of sarcasm. the tone is straightforward and informative, sharing a link and using relevant hashtags to increase visibility. the language used is consistent with genuine promotion of a campaign or artistic work, especially one focused on important social issues like disability representation and equality.

the context of viktoria modesta's work and the serious nature of the topics mentioned (amputees, equality, art) further support that this is a sincere, non-sarcastic tweet meant to draw positive attention to the campaign and its message.",0.0

there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

- the hashtags are neutral but descriptive: #british #textiles #footwear #madeinbritain
- the final hashtag #not-a-nike-clone stands out as potentially negative or sarcastic.

step 2: true intention
- the praise ""stunning work"" seems genuine at first glance.
- the use of multiple hashtags suggests the author is trying to categorize and promote the work.
- however, the last hashtag #not-a-nike-clone implies a comparison to nike, possibly suggesting that the work is actually similar to nike products.
- this final hashtag contradicts the praise and the emphasis on british-made products, hinting at sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is largely positive and promotional.
- the true intention, revealed by the last hashtag, seems to be criticism or mockery.
- there's a clear contradiction between the initial praise and the implication that the product is a nike clone.
- the use of ""#not-a-nike-clone"" is likely a sarcastic way of saying it actually is very similar to nike products.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

@GlobalGrind Niagra Falls tho... Really? #irony #LOL,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be one of amusement or disbelief, indicated by the use of ""really?"" and the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#lol"" (laugh out loud).

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing the choice of niagara falls, likely as a topic or feature in some content by @globalgrind. the use of ""tho..."" (though) suggests skepticism or dismissal. the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly points to a contradictory or unexpected situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of amusement aligns with the true intention of mocking or criticizing. the use of ""really?"" in combination with ""#irony"" and ""#lol"" strongly indicates that the author is not genuinely asking a question but rather expressing sarcastic disbelief or criticism. the explicit mention of irony further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine question about potential improvement in world rankings after hypothetical wins against poland and scotland. the use of ""@youboysingreen @faireland"" suggests engagement with irish football organizations.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely not a genuine question, but rather a criticism of the irish football team's performance. the specific mention of ""65th in the world rankings"" after wins against two decent european teams implies that even with these victories, ireland's ranking would still be quite low. the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag at the end explicitly indicates that the statement is not to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the seemingly innocent question in step 1 and the critical implication in step 2, along with the explicit #sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicates that this statement is sarcastic. the author is using irony to comment on the poor state of irish football, suggesting that even significant wins wouldn't drastically improve their world standing.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as it's not immediately clear if sarcasm is present:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral. it's a straightforward question about nato expansion after 1989, directed at oliver stone. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this question could be:
1. a genuine inquiry seeking information about nato's motivations for expansion after the cold war ended.
2. a rhetorical question implying that nato shouldn't have needed to expand after 1989 (when the berlin wall fell and the cold war was ending).

the phrasing ""why did nato need to expand?"" could suggest the author believes nato didn't actually need to expand, which might indicate a critical stance towards nato's actions.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's no clear contradiction between the surface sentiment and the possible true intention. while the question could be interpreted as rhetorical and implying criticism, it doesn't contain clear markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, obvious irony, or mocking tone.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the possibility that this is a genuine question, i would lean towards classifying this as not sarcastic.

Steps:

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is mixed. the use of ""#irony"" suggests a potentially sarcastic or contradictory situation. the hashtags ""#nomoney"" and ""#parttimecooks"" imply a negative financial situation. however, the phrase ""thanks for..."" could be interpreted as positive gratitude.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be highlighting a contradictory or ironic situation. the user is likely playing a song about money or success while heading to work, despite facing financial struggles (as implied by ""#nomoney"" and ""#parttimecooks""). the truncated ""thanks for..."" at the end could be genuine gratitude or sarcastic appreciation for the song or situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the explicit mention of ""#irony"" at the beginning of the tweet is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the contrast between playing a song (potentially about wealth or success) and the user's apparent financial struggles (indicated by the hashtags) further reinforces the sarcastic tone. the use of social media to highlight this ironic situation is a common way to express sarcasm online.

- however, the true intention is to criticize this economic approach
- the use of ""trickle down fairy"" and especially the ""#not"" hashtag clearly indicate that the author is expressing the opposite of what they literally state

given this analysis, the tweet is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to criticize the idea of trickle-down economics.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the question ""can you not understand"" implies frustration or exasperation
- the capitalization of ""everything"" adds emphasis
- the tone seems confrontational and annoyed

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is criticizing the tendency to relate all topics to the president
- they're implying that the person or people they're addressing are overly focused on the president
- the question is rhetorical, not seeking an actual answer but making a point
- by tagging multiple users, the speaker is publicly calling out this behavior

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of frustration aligns with the true intention of criticism
- the question format is used to make a statement rather than seek information
- the exaggerated phrasing ""everything"" suggests hyperbole, a common element in sarcasm
- the overall tone is confrontational and mocking, typical of sarcastic comments

given this analysis, i believe this comment is intended to be sarcastic. the speaker is using an exaggerated question to criticize and mock others for constantly bringing up the president in unrelated contexts.

When you're in the doctors waiting room and hear a baby in the back screaming her lungs out is always a reassuring feeling #not,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""always a reassuring feeling"" suggests a positive surface sentiment. it implies that hearing a baby screaming in a doctor's waiting room is comforting or reassuring.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is quite different from the surface sentiment. several clues indicate this:
1. the scenario described (a screaming baby in a waiting room) is generally considered unpleasant or stressful.
2. the use of ""screaming her lungs out"" is an exaggeration that emphasizes the negative aspect of the situation.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the preceding statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contradiction between the positive surface sentiment (""reassuring feeling"") and the true negative sentiment implied by the context and the ""#not"" hashtag. this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is using irony to express that the situation is actually very unpleasant and not at all reassuring.

"Well now the festive season has begun, let's take a moment to reflect on how much more royalties Slade and Wizard will get #sarcasm",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative or critical:
- the focus on royalties for slade and wizard (bands known for popular christmas songs) implies criticism of the commercialization of christmas music.
- the hashtag #sarcasm at the end explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""reflect on"" the festive season) contrasts sharply with the implied criticism of the commercialization of christmas music. the explicit use of the #sarcasm hashtag confirms that the statement is not meant sincerely.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or anxiety about a parenting situation. the speaker is likely sharing a real problem they're facing: they forgot to move the ""elf on the shelf"" (a christmas tradition), which has led to their child questioning the reality of christmas. the ""@nannyprobss"" mention suggests this is being shared as a relatable parenting challenge.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the tweet seems to be a genuine expression of a parent's distress over a holiday-related mishap. the use of ""mb"" (likely ""my bad"" or someone's initials) and the specific details about the elf and the child's age (10) add authenticity to the statement. the emoji reinforces the sincere emotional content rather than indicating irony.

- the use of hashtags like #megatron and #transformers suggests it's related to the popular franchise.
- the inclusion of #irony at the end hints at some deeper meaning.

step 2: true intention
- megatron is a fictional character, a robot from the transformers series.
- the idea of megatron ""ranting about social media"" is inherently absurd, as megatron doesn't exist in our world and wouldn't use social media.

        ### Label: 

        ","given the limited context provided in this input, i don't have enough confidence to make a direct judgment about whether this is sarcastic or not. let's break it down step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the text appears to be a fragment, possibly continuing a previous thought.
- it mentions fish species: trout and northern pike.
- there are several twitter handles mentioned, suggesting this is part of a conversation.
- there are no clear emotional keywords, phrases, or emojis to indicate sentiment.

step 2: true intention
- without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention.
- the mention of fish species could be literal or could be part of a metaphor or analogy.
- the inclusion of multiple twitter handles suggests the speaker is addressing or referencing multiple people in a conversation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there isn't enough information to detect any discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention.
- the lack of context makes it impossible to determine if there's any sarcastic tone or implication.
- without understanding the broader conversation or the relationships between the mentioned users, we can't infer sarcasm.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the absence of context, the safest assumption is that this statement is likely not sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough evaluation:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""there's no better way"" suggesting something highly desirable
- exclamation marks indicating enthusiasm
- positive emojis (☺😊)
- ""start the week"" implying a good beginning

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- getting wisdom teeth removed is generally an unpleasant experience
- 8 am is typically considered early, especially for a medical procedure
- the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly negates the positive statement
- the use of multiple exclamation marks and emojis may be exaggerated, hinting at insincerity

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the superficially positive sentiment and the likely negative true intention. the exaggerated positivity about an typically unpleasant experience (wisdom teeth removal), combined with the early time and the explicit negation (""#not""), strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using false enthusiasm to express their actual displeasure with the situation.

The most exciting way to start a Friday: a presentation on structurally deficient bridges. #sarcasm #lobbyinglife,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""the most exciting way to start a friday,"" which typically indicates enthusiasm and enjoyment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually negative or unenthusiastic. the topic of the presentation (""structurally deficient bridges"") is likely not considered exciting by most people. additionally, the explicit use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" clearly indicates that the author is being sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the enthusiastic surface sentiment and the likely boring or technical nature of the actual topic. this contrast, combined with the explicit use of ""#sarcasm,"" leaves no doubt that the statement is intended sarcastically. the author is using irony to comment on the mundane or potentially dull nature of their work.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""new shirt"" and the hashtag ""#new #shirt"" suggest a straightforward announcement about getting a new item of clothing. however, the long string of hashtags that follow, especially ""#im #sorry #its #just #i #literally #do #not #care #at #all"", introduces a contradictory tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing indifference or even annoyance, rather than excitement about a new shirt. the excessive use of hashtags, particularly the phrase ""i literally do not care at all"", strongly indicates that the author is not actually enthusiastic about the new shirt or sharing this information.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the initial announcement of a new shirt and the subsequent expression of not caring. this contrast between the surface sentiment (sharing news about a new item) and the true intention (expressing indifference or frustration) is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the exaggerated use of hashtags further emphasizes this sarcastic tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to correct a misunderstanding or misconception. the speaker is clarifying that a previous comparison was invalid because it was comparing two different things (the case and the recording). the use of the idiom ""apples and oranges"" reinforces this point by emphasizing the fundamental difference between the items being compared.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as there are multiple elements to consider:

step 1: surface sentiment
- ""wow...lol"" suggests excitement or amusement
- the question ""need cash in your hands today?"" seems promotional
- multiple hashtags: #workfromhome (positive), #not (negative), #wun, #mca
- links included, likely to promotional content

step 2: true intention
- ""wow...lol"" followed by a promotional-sounding question suggests mockery
- the repetition of ""#not"" implies negation or contradiction
- the mixture of positive (#workfromhome) and negative (#not) hashtags creates confusion
- the overall structure mimics spam or get-rich-quick scheme promotions

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear mismatch between the initial excited ""wow...lol"" and the promotional content that follows
- the use of ""#not"" twice suggests the author is contradicting the apparent promotional message
- the tweet appears to be mocking or criticizing such promotional messages or get-rich-quick schemes
- the structure and content imitate spam-like messages, but the ""lol"" and ""#not"" tags indicate this is not genuine

given this analysis, the tweet appears to be using sarcasm to mock promotional or get-rich-quick messages.

### Example:
Input: ""auntie just called and said shes on her way..|i better get dressed then :astonished_face::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part is neutral, stating a fact about auntie calling.
- the second part expresses surprise and amusement with the astonished face and laughing emojis.
- the phrase ""i better get dressed then"" could be read as slightly exasperated, but the emojis suggest it's meant lightheartedly.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is genuinely informing about their aunt's imminent arrival.
- they're humorously acknowledging that they're not fully prepared (not dressed yet).
- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention.
- there's no contradiction between the words and the emojis.
- the humor is self-deprecating rather than sarcastic towards others.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive or relieved. the phrase ""at least"" suggests finding a silver lining or positive aspect in a situation. not having to clean the floor is presented as a benefit or advantage.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely expressing frustration or disappointment about a situation, with the floor cleaning comment being a sarcastic attempt to find a positive aspect. this could imply that something negative has happened (perhaps damage to the floor or a spill), but the speaker is sarcastically pointing out a trivial ""benefit"" to downplay or cope with the negative situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a disconnect between the surface sentiment (positive/relieved) and the likely true intention (frustrated/disappointed). the use of ""at least"" in this context is often a marker for sarcasm, where someone points out an insignificant positive in the face of a larger negative. the statement minimizes the importance of floor cleaning compared to what is likely a more significant issue at hand.

given this analysis, i believe this statement is sarcastic.

2. the context implies that bye weeks and games against fcs (football championship subdivision) teams are being blamed for losses, which is an unreasonable explanation.

the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""is [she] all there?"", ""sounds blonde"", and hashtags ""#ignorant"" and ""#articulate minority"" suggest a disapproving tone towards the subject.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. the tweet expresses a straightforward negative opinion without employing sarcastic devices like exaggeration, mock praise, or ironic contrast.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be critical and confrontational. the use of capitalized ""not"" and multiple hashtags for emphasis suggests strong disagreement with senator warren. the questioning tone (""do you #know...?"") implies the author is challenging the senator's knowledge.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the author appears to be genuinely correcting what they perceive as a misunderstanding about the us government system. they are asserting that the usa is a republic, not a democracy, and questioning if senator warren knows the pledge of allegiance (which includes ""to the republic"").

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are in alignment. there's no evidence of irony, exaggeration, or other hallmarks of sarcasm. the tweet is a straightforward, albeit forceful, disagreement and correction. the use of hashtags and capitalization is for emphasis rather than sarcastic effect.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm
- the tweet likely means the joke was actually terrible or inappropriate, not genuinely good

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""mother of the year"" typically indicates praise and positive sentiment
- ""i blame my mom"" has a negative connotation
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates sarcasm

step 2: true intention
- ""i blame my mom"" suggests the speaker is attributing something negative to their mother
- ""mother of the year"" is likely used ironically, given the context of blame
- the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag confirms that the speaker is not being sincere in their praise

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise (""mother of the year"") directly contradicts the negative sentiment of blaming
- the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" leaves no doubt about the speaker's intention
- the true meaning is likely that the speaker's mother has done something they disapprove of or find problematic

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be one of frustration or mild annoyance. the author describes a situation where they were preparing to organize books but ended up forgetting to bring a book they needed. the use of ""#irony"" at the end suggests the author finds this situation ironic.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out the irony of the situation. the author was dealing with books (pulling them out to organize bookshelves) which led to forgetting a book they needed. this contradiction between being surrounded by books and yet forgetting a necessary book is the core of the irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of frustration aligns with the true intention of pointing out irony. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly labels the situation as ironic. while irony and sarcasm are related, they are not always the same. in this case, the statement appears to be genuinely ironic rather than sarcastic. the author is not using exaggeration or saying the opposite of what they mean (which are common in sarcasm), but rather pointing out a genuinely ironic situation.

- the speaker is playfully critiquing the idea that sarcasm needs to be explicitly labeled to be understood

- positive elements: ""girls just wanna have fun"", ""#dance"", ""#drinks"", ""#antennagrouprocks""
- negative elements: ""#not"", ""#only""
- the surface sentiment appears mixed, with fun and positive activities mentioned alongside limiting hashtags

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""girls just wanna have fun"" is a reference to a popular song about enjoying life
- the hashtags seem to contradict this sentiment: ""#work#not#friends#only"" suggests a focus on work rather than fun
- ""#antennagrouprocks"" and the linked content imply this might be related to a work event or company
- the overall message seems to be about a work-related event that involves dancing and drinks, but not necessarily just for fun

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a subtle mismatch between the opening phrase suggesting fun and the hashtags implying work focus
- the use of ""just wanna have fun"" followed by work-related tags could be seen as a mild form of irony
- however, the inclusion of positive elements like dance and drinks suggests the event might actually be enjoyable
- the tone doesn't seem overtly sarcastic, but rather a playful way of describing a work event with some fun elements

- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

- people's work being ""canceled,"" which might seem inconvenient
- the use of ""#stormageddon"" suggests a dramatic or negative event

step 2: true intention
the true intention reveals a mix of observations and personal experience:
- the storm is significant enough to cause widespread work cancellations
- despite this, the speaker was actually early to work
- the use of ""#irony"" explicitly points out the contradiction in their situation

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the widespread cancellations and the speaker's personal outcome (being early to work) creates a situational irony. the use of ""#irony"" confirms that the speaker is aware of and highlighting this contradiction. while not overtly mocking or critical, the tweet uses a mild form of sarcasm to point out the unexpected personal result amidst a larger disruptive event.

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

- ""ohh yeaa!!!!"" suggests genuine excitement or approval
- the link at the end implies sharing content the user finds interesting or agreeable
- the overall tone seems casual and genuine rather than ironic

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention
- the tweet doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or mock enthusiasm
- the combination of self-deprecation and excitement is more likely genuine than sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet includes ""#sarcasm"", which explicitly indicates sarcasm
- ""before you kill yourself ;)"" could be read as dark humor or a light-hearted joke
- the overall tone seems helpful, mentioning ""many good pros"" and recommending @balancephysio

step 2: true intention
- the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag is referring to a previous tweet, not necessarily this one
- the phrase ""before you kill yourself"" is likely hyperbole, not meant literally
- the winking emoticon "";)"" suggests a playful or friendly tone
- the main intention seems to be offering genuine advice about proper usage of something (possibly exercise or physical therapy techniques)

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the tweet mentions sarcasm, it's referring to a previous tweet
- the current tweet appears to be offering sincere advice and recommendations
- the hyperbolic language and emoticon are used for emphasis and friendliness, not to convey sarcasm
- the overall message seems straightforward and helpful, without any clear mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention

based on this analysis, i believe the correct label is:

Steps:

- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
however, the ""#not"" at the end completely changes the meaning. this hashtag is commonly used to negate or contradict what was just said. in this context, it suggests that the speaker actually does not want to go to church at all.

there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (enthusiastic about going to church) and the true intention (not wanting to go to church at all). the use of exaggerated enthusiasm followed by a contradicting hashtag is a classic sarcastic structure. the speaker is using irony to express their true feelings, which are opposite to what they initially stated.

- the phrase ""republican move"" suggests a political action.
- ""effectively rob the royals"" implies that the royals are being victimized.
- the question ""who is being robbed?"" seems to challenge this notion.
- the hashtag ""#irony"" is used, explicitly pointing to ironic intent.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is actually criticizing the royal family's extravagant spending.
- it points out that kate is spending 32,000 on a single meal.
- the question ""who is being robbed?"" is rhetorical, implying that the royals are not the victims but rather the ones doing the ""robbing"" through excessive spending.
- the use of quotation marks around 'republican move' and 'effectively rob the royals' suggests skepticism about these claims.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment presents the royals as victims, but the true intention is to criticize their lavish spending.

### Example:

Steps:

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

several clues indicate sarcasm:
- the statement contains a contradiction: someone can't logically be both ""interesting"" and ""so, so, so boring.""
- the use of hashtags, particularly ""#irony,"" explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.
- the ""#what"" hashtag further emphasizes confusion or disbelief, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contradiction between ""interesting"" and ""boring,"" combined with the explicit use of ""#irony,"" strongly indicates that the true intention is to sarcastically comment on someone's lack of interesting qualities. the surface-level compliment (""interesting"") is undermined by the exaggerated criticism (""so, so, so boring""), creating a clear sarcastic effect.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""not going this time"" implies past attendance and disappointment
- ""we might have a chance"" is likely not meant literally, given the context
- the saying about being fooled suggests past negative experiences
- the hashtag strongly reinforces a negative attitude towards the situation
- the true intention appears to be expressing frustration and a refusal to participate again

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear mismatch between the seemingly positive ""we might have a chance"" and the overall negative sentiment
- the use of the proverb about being fooled suggests the speaker doesn't actually believe they have a chance
- the contrast between the mild language in the first part and the harsh hashtag at the end further indicates sarcasm
- the speaker is using irony to emphasize their negative feelings about the situation

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the tweet requires some careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly positive.
- ""minky wale tail fritter"" sounds like an exotic or luxurious food item.
- ""bijoux flat"" suggests something small but fancy.
- there are no overtly positive or negative words.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely making a comment on the high cost of housing.
- ""minky wale tail fritter"" is probably not a real dish, but rather an absurd, made-up luxury item.
- port talbot is a town in wales not typically associated with expensive property.
- the comparison between an absurd luxury food item and a small flat suggests criticism of housing prices.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface neutrality contrasts with the underlying criticism.
- the use of exaggeration (comparing an absurd luxury food to property prices) is a common sarcastic technique.
- the juxtaposition of the fancy-sounding ""bijoux flat"" with the industrial town of port talbot adds to the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### Example:
Input: ""3:30am is a great time to learn the male reproductive system. with the biggest and brightest power point slides ever. #biology""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""great,"" ""biggest,"" ""brightest""
- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""first"", ""proudly"", ""putting journalism first""
- the hashtag #nlprimetime suggests importance
- overall, the surface sentiment appears positive and praising of @ibnlive

step 2: true intention
- cutting to ads during primetime is generally seen as interrupting important content
- the phrase ""putting journalism first"" contradicts the action of prioritizing ads over news
- the hashtag #irony directly indicates that the statement is not to be taken at face value

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface praise for being ""first"" to cut to ads sharply contrasts with the implied criticism of interrupting news coverage
- the claim of ""putting journalism first"" is directly contradicted by the described action
- the use of quotation marks around ""putting journalism first"" suggests skepticism
- the #irony hashtag confirms that the author intends the opposite of what is literally stated

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be making serious claims about race and genetics, with phrases like ""white skin"" and ""racist dna"". the tone seems confrontational and accusatory. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end stands out as potentially contradictory.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention appears to be mocking or ridiculing someone's views on race and genetics. the reference to the person being a ""geneticist too"" is likely not meant to be taken literally, but rather to sarcastically undermine their credibility. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the preceding statements are not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear discrepancy between the surface-level serious claims about race and genetics and the likely intention to mock such views. the use of exaggeration (""racist dna"") and the sarcastic implication of expertise (""he's a geneticist too"") are rhetorical devices often employed in sarcasm. the clinching factor is the ""#not"" hashtag, which explicitly signals that the preceding content should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and frustrated. the use of all caps for ""i just want to be done"" conveys a strong emotional state, likely stress or exasperation. the hashtag ""#4hoursleft"" adds a sense of urgency and countdown, reinforcing the stressful context.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. the speaker is genuinely expressing their desire for their finals to be over. the countdown in the hashtag suggests they are actually in the midst of their final exams period, with 4 hours remaining. this appears to be a sincere expression of stress and anticipation for the end of exams.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no discernible discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement is a straightforward expression of the speaker's current emotional state and situation regarding their finals. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the use of caps lock and the hashtag serve to emphasize the genuine feeling rather than to convey any sarcastic undertone.

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out the irony of a pizza place replacing a crossfit gym. crossfit is associated with intense fitness and health, while pizza is often seen as unhealthy or indulgent. the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly signals the author's intention to highlight this contrast.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of a neutral statement with a potentially positive hashtag about pizza contrasts with the underlying intention of pointing out the ironic replacement of a fitness-focused business with a food often associated with unhealthy eating. the use of ""#irony"" further confirms the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the intended meaning isn't immediately clear to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of genuine curiosity or concern. the use of double question marks ""??"" suggests some urgency or emphasis in the inquiry. the phrase ""now what"" implies this is a recurring or ongoing situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be seeking information about someone's (likely a public figure's) recent actions or statements. the use of ""@"" mentions suggests this is a social media conversation. the phrase ""now what"" could imply exasperation or weariness with the person's behavior, but it's not definitively sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant mismatch. the question seems to be a straightforward request for information, possibly with a hint of exasperation. however, there's not enough context or clear indicators of sarcasm to confidently label this as sarcastic.

given this analysis, i believe the most appropriate label is:

### label: not sarcastic

the question appears to be a genuine inquiry without clear markers of sarcasm.",0.0

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. phrases like ""seems she's cracked it"" suggest success or achievement. the use of hashtags like #viral could indicate enthusiasm about a successful formula for creating popular content.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be critical or mocking. the formula ""celebrity + stunt = #viral"" is oversimplified, suggesting that the speaker believes this approach to be shallow or too easy. the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly signals that the preceding statement should not be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface positive sentiment about alison jackson's work and viral content creation, and the underlying criticism implied by the oversimplification and explicit sarcasm tag. this contrast between apparent praise and actual critique is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

        ","sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment because:

1. the statement ""spending the majority of my day in and out of the doctor has been awesome"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally. most people would not genuinely find spending a lot of time at the doctor's office to be ""awesome.""

2. the use of the word ""awesome"" to describe what is typically an unpleasant experience (multiple doctor visits) is a classic example of sarcasm.

3. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be understood as sarcastic.

these factors together make it very clear that this tweet is intended to be sarcastic, expressing frustration or annoyance with having to spend a lot of time at the doctor's office.",1.0

- ""particularly horatio's involvement"" suggests approval or appreciation.
- the hashtag ""#bloodlinecontinues"" seems neutral but potentially meaningful.
- the ""xxx"" at the end typically indicates affection or friendliness.
overall, the surface sentiment appears positive and supportive.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is a response to @anthonyboutall, praising their tweet.
- the mention of ""horatio's involvement"" suggests this may be related to a fictional narrative or storyline.
- ""#bloodlinecontinues"" could be referring to a continuation of a story or character lineage.
- the ""p.s."" format and casual ""xxx"" ending indicate a friendly, informal tone.
the true intention seems to be genuine praise and engagement with the content of the original tweet.

- there are no apparent contradictions or exaggerations that would suggest sarcasm.
- the language used is straightforward and lacks typical markers of sarcasm such as hyperbole or irony.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of concern and caution. the phrase ""i hope you weren't driving"" suggests care for safety. the use of hashtags like #spnews and #yxe (likely referring to saskatoon) gives context. the final hashtag #irony might be taken at face value as simply labeling the situation.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be calling out potentially unsafe behavior. the tweet is likely responding to a picture posted by @thestarphoenix, possibly of traffic or road conditions. by hoping they weren't driving while taking the picture, the author is implicitly suggesting that they might have been, which would be unsafe. the use of #irony at the end is key - it's not just labeling the situation, but pointing out the contradiction of a news source potentially engaging in unsafe driving behavior while likely reporting on traffic or safety.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface concern conflicts with the underlying criticism. the seemingly sincere hope is actually a veiled accusation or criticism. the #irony hashtag is the clearest indicator that this tweet is not to be taken at face value, but is pointing out a contradictory or hypocritical situation.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the initial positive exclamation ""#yay"" and the true negative sentiment expressed by the rest of the text. this juxtaposition, combined with the use of ""#not"" to explicitly negate the positive statement, strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to emphasize their displeasure with their work schedule.

@LariatOfHestia: Gavy is one rude motherfucker. *Subtweets me* *Calls me a motherfucker* #Irony,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of strong language: ""rude motherfucker""
- accusatory tone: calling out gavy's behavior
- use of hashtag ""#irony"" suggesting awareness of a contradiction

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out hypocrisy or inconsistency:
- the speaker accuses gavy of being rude
- then immediately describes gavy's actions (subtweeting and name-calling) that mirror the accusation
- the use of ""#irony"" explicitly highlights this contradiction

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention appears to be highlighting the irony of the situation. the speaker is using a straightforward description of events, but the addition of ""#irony"" transforms the statement into a commentary on the inconsistency between gavy's actions and the accusation.

the use of irony to point out contradictory behavior is a common form of sarcasm. the speaker isn't literally just calling gavy rude, but rather using this statement to sarcastically highlight the hypocrisy of gavy's actions.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement ""access to housing is not a fundamental human right"" appears to be neutral or slightly negative on the surface.
- there are no explicitly positive or negative keywords.
- the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than emotional.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely referencing a court decision or legal interpretation in ontario.
- the inclusion of hashtags (#onpoli #topoli #cdnpoli) suggests this is a political issue.
- the statement contradicts widely held beliefs about human rights, which is unexpected and potentially controversial.
- the link provided likely leads to more information about this decision or interpretation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral, but the content is likely to evoke strong reactions.
- the statement is presented in a straightforward manner, but it's so contrary to common human rights discourse that it seems designed to provoke outrage or disbelief.
- the use of ""not a fundamental human right"" in reference to housing access is likely meant to highlight the perceived absurdity or injustice of the court's decision.
- the inclusion of political hashtags suggests the author is drawing attention to this issue for political discussion or criticism.

given this analysis, the tweet appears to be using understatement to highlight a controversial decision. the author is likely criticizing the court's stance by stating it plainly, expecting readers to recognize the absurdity on their own.

- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention

- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour

- negative tone with phrases like ""friendzoned too many times"" and ""all my life this has happened""
- positive phrase ""perks of being the good guy"" seems out of place with the negative context
- use of hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates sarcasm

step 2: true intention
- the author is likely expressing frustration about repeatedly being put in the ""friend zone""
- ""perks of being the good guy"" is likely meant ironically, as the author sees no actual perks
- the #sarcasm hashtag confirms the author's intention to be sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or amused:
- ""you want to see something irish!!"" sounds enthusiastic
- the laughing emoji 😂😂😂 suggests amusement
- ""#irony"" could be seen as playful

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, several elements suggest the true intention is mockery or criticism:
- ""of all the reasons to be closed"" implies the reason for closure is absurd or inappropriate
- the excessive use of exclamation marks and laughing emojis may be exaggerating a reaction, often a sign of sarcasm
- ""#irony"" directly points to the statement not being meant literally
- the linked image (http://t.co/epygva9pwu) likely shows something contradictory or ridiculous related to the closure

step 3: comparison and analysis
the enthusiastic surface sentiment contrasts sharply with the implied criticism of the closure reason. the use of exaggeration, the irony hashtag, and the likely contradictory image all point to a sarcastic intent. the author is using humor and irony to criticize or mock the situation.

I am so ready for Monday. 🙆 #sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

i'm highly confident in this classification based on several clear indicators:

1. the statement ""i am so ready for monday"" is typically not a sincere sentiment, as most people don't eagerly anticipate the start of the work week.

2. the use of the 🙆 emoji (person gesturing ok) in this context appears to be ironic, emphasizing the insincerity of the statement.

3. most definitively, the inclusion of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly labels the statement as sarcastic.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or confrontational. the use of ""smartass"" is typically derogatory. the question ""didn't it work anyway??"" could be read as defensive or challenging.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be making a point through sarcasm. the hashtag ""#irony"" is a strong indicator that the author is being deliberately ironic or sarcastic. the rhetorical question ""didn't it work anyway??"" suggests the author is pointing out a contradiction or flaw in someone else's logic or behavior.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface negativity contrasts with the underlying intention of making a sarcastic point. the use of ""smartass"" and the rhetorical question are likely not meant to be taken at face value, but rather to highlight the irony of the situation. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

given this analysis, especially considering the explicit use of ""#irony"", i can confidently classify this as:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm
- the tweet likely means the joke was actually terrible or inappropriate, not genuinely good

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the first sentence is neutral in tone, simply stating a realization.
- the second part ""faaaaa-"" suggests an intense emotional reaction, likely negative given the context.
- the truncation of ""faaaaa-"" implies it's the start of an exclamation or expletive, often used to express frustration or dismay.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker has just realized their final exam is tomorrow, which is likely causing stress or panic.
- the ""faaaaa-"" is likely the beginning of an expletive or exclamation like ""faaaaack"" or ""faaaail"", expressing genuine distress or frustration.
- the sudden realization and immediate emotional reaction suggest this is a sincere expression of alarm or dismay.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. there's no mismatch between what's said and what's meant.
- the exaggerated ""faaaaa-"" is not used ironically but as a genuine expression of negative emotion.
- there are no indicators of humor, irony, or overstatement that would suggest sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention

the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm in this tweet is subtle and requires careful analysis.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the tweet states a historical fact about christian europe translating islamic manuscripts. the use of ""#irony"" could be interpreted as simply noting an interesting historical occurrence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the use of ""#irony"" is key to understanding the true intention. the author is likely pointing out the contradiction or unexpected nature of christian europe relying on islamic scholarly work, given the historical and current tensions between these cultures. the inclusion of multiple twitter handles suggests this is part of a larger conversation or debate about cultural/religious relations.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface neutrality of stating a historical fact is contrasted with the pointed use of ""#irony"". this hashtag transforms what could be a simple statement into a commentary on the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of cultural interactions and knowledge transfer. the author is using this historical fact to make a subtle point about current cultural or religious debates, likely in a way that contradicts or challenges the views of those mentioned in the tweet.

- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention

- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""still makes me cry"" typically indicates sadness or frustration. the mention of ""two years later"" suggests an ongoing issue.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely humorous self-deprecation. gingerbread house making is generally considered a fun, lighthearted holiday activity. the exaggeration of it making the speaker ""cry"" even after two years is probably not meant literally, but rather to humorously emphasize their continued lack of skill or frustration with the task.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a mismatch between the surface sentiment (negative) and the likely true intention (humorous). the use of hyperbole (""makes me cry"" over a trivial activity) and the context of a typically enjoyable holiday tradition suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to poke fun at their own lack of improvement in this skill.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. amar singh's ""a+ rating"" suggests a very positive view of the modi government. however, arun shourie's comment that ""more is said than done"" implies criticism. the hashtag #irony also suggests a conflict between these views.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the contradiction between these two perspectives. the use of ""#irony"" is key here, explicitly pointing out the conflicting nature of these assessments. the author is likely not endorsing either view, but rather drawing attention to the disparity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface presents two conflicting views of the modi government. the true intention is to highlight this contradiction, using the hashtag #irony to make the point explicit. this deliberate juxtaposition of opposing views, coupled with the irony hashtag, strongly suggests a sarcastic intent. the author is using these contrasting opinions to satirize the political discourse or the varying perceptions of the government's performance.

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to go through the steps, but here's a brief explanation:

the tweet uses clear sarcasm indicators:

1. the exaggerated positive sentiment (""absolutely positive"") contrasts with the likely true feeling.
2. the content describes a situation that most coaches would find annoying, not something they ""love.""
3. the hashtags ""#sarcasm"" and ""#not"" explicitly signal sarcastic intent.
4. the final hashtag ""#sticktoparenting"" reinforces the true message that parents should not interfere with coaching.

these elements clearly indicate that the tweet is sarcastic, mocking the idea of parents trying to tell coaches how to do their job.",1.0

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step as the context isn't entirely clear, and sarcasm can be subtle.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""nice touch"" suggests a positive sentiment
- there's no obvious negative language or sarcastic markers
- the statement seems to be describing a situation at a venue (likely a sports ground)
- the surface sentiment appears genuinely positive

step 2: true intention
- the statement is describing bar staff wearing #saintsfc t-shirts, which likely refers to southampton football club
- this could be seen as a show of support or unity within the venue
- without more context, there's no clear indication that the speaker is being insincere
- the true intention seems to be appreciation for this gesture

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention appear to align
- there's no obvious contradiction or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm
- the statement is straightforward and lacks typical sarcastic markers
- without additional context that might suggest otherwise, it seems the speaker is genuinely approving of this detail

given this analysis, i believe the most appropriate label is:

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be mixed. the use of ""trust me"" suggests confidence, but the rolling eyes emoji (😒) and see-no-evil monkey emoji (🙈) indicate frustration or disbelief. the hashtag #irony explicitly points to sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking the uefa champions league's draw process, implying that manchester city (mcfc) consistently gets favorable draws against scandinavian teams. the phrase ""do love @mcfc i see"" is likely meant sarcastically, suggesting the opposite - that the champions league unfairly favors manchester city.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of confidence (""trust me"") contrasts with the true intention of criticism and frustration. the use of emojis and the #irony hashtag further reinforce the sarcastic tone. the mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning, along with the explicit labeling of irony, strongly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the phrase ""i literally love,"" which typically expresses strong positive emotion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative. ""throw me in at the deep end"" is an idiom meaning to put someone in a difficult situation without preparation. the hashtags #irony and #tough #life further suggest that the speaker is actually describing a challenging or unpleasant experience.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface positive sentiment (""love"") and the true negative meaning (being unprepared in a difficult situation). the use of ""literally"" emphasizes this contrast. the hashtag #irony explicitly signals that the statement should not be taken at face value. this combination of contrasting surface and true meanings, along with the irony hashtag, strongly indicates sarcasm.

- the use of ""#haha"" suggests amusement or laughter
- multiple hashtags like ""#we #are #not #mind #readers"" appear straightforward
- ""agree with that..."" indicates agreement or alignment with something

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""we are not mind readers"" is likely referring to a common relationship complaint
- the ""#haha"" after this phrase suggests it's not meant to be taken entirely seriously
- the ""repost"" indicates this is sharing content from elsewhere, possibly adding commentary
- the truncated sentence ""you may think we are, but we are..."" implies a twist or contradiction to the previous statement

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface appears straightforward, the combination of elements suggests playful irony
- the agreement followed by ""#we #are #not #mind #readers"" and then a contradictory ""but we are..."" implies sarcasm
- the use of ""#haha"" further reinforces that this is not meant to be taken literally
- the format of sharing and commenting on a post often lends itself to sarcastic or humorous commentary

- the first part of the tweet suggests plans to have a pint at a pub called ""the boar's head"" on december 9th.
- the hashtag ""#not really"" contradicts the previous statement.
- ""still in bed"" indicates the person is actually not going out.
- the smiling face emoji (😊) suggests a positive or content mood.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is actually conveying that the person is not going out to the pub as initially stated.
- they are instead staying in bed, which they seem happy about (as indicated by the emoji).
- the phrase ""day ninth december"" mimics a formal or dramatic announcement style, which contrasts with the casual nature of the actual content.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear mismatch between the initial statement (going to the pub) and the reality (staying in bed).
- the use of ""#not really"" explicitly signals that the first part of the tweet is not true.
- the contrast between the formal-sounding date announcement and the casual reality adds to the humorous effect.
- the person seems to be playfully mocking the idea of going out by presenting it dramatically and then immediately contradicting it.

the surface sentiment appears mixed. the initial statement is factual about speed cameras and police presence. however, the use of exclamation marks, hashtags like ""#waste #of #money"", and emojis (laughing face 😂, police car 🚓, and siren 🚨) suggest a strong emotional reaction, likely negative or mocking.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism and mockery of what the author perceives as excessive use of resources. the phrase ""& yes it takes 5 police officers!!"" followed by multiple hashtags emphasizing it doesn't require five individuals, coupled with the laughing emoji, strongly suggests the author finds this situation ridiculous or unnecessary.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the factual surface statement and the true intention of mockery. the use of exaggeration (""5 police officers!!""), emphatic hashtags, and particularly the laughing emoji 😂 in context with critical hashtags all point to a sarcastic tone. the author is using irony to criticize what they see as a waste of resources.

- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention

- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm

        ","sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet ""picked an excellent day to get my hair done 😒 #sarcasm"" is clearly sarcastic for several reasons:

1. the use of positive language (""excellent day"") is immediately contradicted by the unamused face emoji (😒), which expresses dissatisfaction or annoyance.

2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the tweet as sarcastic, leaving no doubt about the author's intention.

3. the phrase ""picked an excellent day"" is a common sarcastic expression used when something goes wrong or when the timing is particularly bad.

the surface sentiment appears positive, but the emoji and hashtag make it clear that the true intention is to express frustration or disappointment about the timing of getting their hair done. the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" confirms this interpretation.",1.0

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears neutral to positive.
- ""make it a classic"" suggests enthusiasm or endorsement.
- the hashtag ""#thanksgiving"" is neutral but contextualizes the content.
- there's no overtly negative language or sarcastic indicators.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet seems to be genuinely promoting or sharing information about ""the turkey song"" by @dickiestickhead.
- abc (likely referring to the tv network) is reviewing or featuring this song.
- the phrase ""make it a classic"" appears to be encouraging people to embrace this song as a thanksgiving tradition.
- the link probably leads to more information or the actual song/video.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there doesn't appear to be any mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a straightforward promotion or sharing of thanksgiving-related content.
- there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, contradiction, or irony.

Waking up with a pounding headache is just what I need for this final #sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

- the use of ""better"" suggests a positive comparison.
- the ellipsis (""..) at the end could indicate a trailing off thought or imply more than what's explicitly stated.

step 2: true intention
- this phrase is often used as a common, somewhat cliché expression to acknowledge life's ups and downs.
- the ellipsis could suggest resignation or imply that the speaker is having a particularly bad day.
- without more context, it's difficult to determine if the speaker is genuinely reflecting on good days or implying the opposite of what's stated.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention are not clearly aligned.
- the statement could be sincere, or it could be sarcastic depending on the context and tone.
- the ambiguity and potential for understatement make it possible that this could be a sarcastic comment about having a bad day.
- however, without more context or clear indicators of sarcasm, we can't definitively label it as sarcastic.

- the tweet starts by listing what the subject is not: ""superwoman, wonder woman, nor dorothy from the wizard of oz""
- it ends with ""women of excellence"" which has a positive connotation
- there's a link shared, suggesting the author wants to provide more information

step 2: true intention
- the author is likely praising a woman or women by comparing them to fictional heroines
- by stating what the subject is not, the author is implying that the real woman/women are even more impressive than these fictional characters

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or realization, as indicated by ""i didn't realize."" there's no overtly positive or negative sentiment expressed. the hashtags #irony and #brands are notable but not part of the main statement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely to point out a contradiction or mistake. the speaker is implying that boston coach, presumably a transportation company associated with boston, shouldn't be operating in chicago. the use of ""#irony"" strongly suggests that the speaker is highlighting this contradiction sarcastically. the ""#brands"" hashtag further implies criticism of brand inconsistency or misrepresentation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of simple realization (step 1) contrasts with the likely true intention of criticizing or mocking the situation (step 2). the use of ""i didn't realize"" is likely feigned naivety, used to emphasize the perceived absurdity of boston coach operating in chicago. the explicit use of ""#irony"" further confirms the sarcastic intent.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) suggests amusement
- the exclamation marks ""!!!"" indicate excitement or emphasis
- the hashtag ""#sarcasmfail"" directly references sarcasm

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is referencing a misidentification, where someone thought the person being addressed was ""padoin sister""
- the ""lol"" and multiple exclamation marks suggest the speaker finds this misidentification funny or ridiculous
- the use of ""somebody"" in quotes implies skepticism or mockery towards the person who made the misidentification
- ""#sarcasmfail"" indicates that there was an attempt at sarcasm that didn't work out as intended

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of amusement aligns with the true intention of finding humor in the situation
- however, the ""#sarcasmfail"" hashtag explicitly points out that sarcasm was involved, even if it wasn't successful
- the overall tone is mocking towards the person who made the misidentification, which is a common feature of sarcastic comments

based on this analysis, particularly the explicit mention of sarcasm in the hashtag and the mocking tone, we can conclude:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- negative sentiment expressed through ""once again"" implying repetition of an undesirable action
- ""*primal scream*"" suggests extreme frustration or anger
- use of exclamation mark emphasizes strong emotion

step 2: true intention
- the tweet criticizes barack obama for allegedly misrepresenting facts about the cuba embargo
- ""re writing history"" implies dishonesty or manipulation of facts
- the ""*primal scream*"" is likely hyperbole to express intense disagreement or frustration
- use of ""#tcot"" (top conservatives on twitter) suggests alignment with conservative views critical of obama

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention of criticizing obama
- the exaggerated expression ""*primal scream*"" adds intensity but doesn't contradict the overall message
- there's no apparent mismatch between the literal words and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm
- the tweet appears to be a straightforward, albeit emphatic, expression of disagreement with obama's statements

label: not sarcastic

the tweet expresses genuine criticism and frustration without employing sarcasm. the strong language and hyperbole serve to emphasize the author's sincere disagreement rather than to convey an opposite meaning sarcastically.",0.0

- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention.
- there's no contradiction between the words and the emojis.
- the humor is self-deprecating rather than sarcastic towards others.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the opening ""wow"" suggests surprise or amazement.
- the phrase ""look what ... has been arrested for"" indicates a revealing or noteworthy event.
- the mention of ""hands up, don't shoot"" pose refers to a protest gesture.
- overall, the surface tone seems to be one of surprise and drawing attention to news.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely drawing attention to perceived hypocrisy or irony.
- by mentioning the ""hands up, don't shoot"" pose (associated with protesting police brutality) and then referring to the player's arrest, the author seems to be implying a contradiction between the player's public stance and personal actions.
- the inclusion of ""#ferguson"" further contextualizes this within broader discussions of police interactions and protests.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface ""wow"" and call to ""look"" don't align straightforwardly with the content; they're more likely expressions of mock surprise or disbelief.
- the tweet is structured to highlight a perceived irony, which is a common feature of sarcasm.
- the author seems to be using this news to make a point about the credibility or consistency of those involved in protests, rather than simply sharing information.

- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""someone needs to stop me before i kill someone"" suggests extreme anger or frustration
- the angry face emoji (😡) reinforces this negative emotion
- ""love waking up in the worst fcking mood"" appears to express enjoyment of a bad mood
- the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of negation

step 2: true intention
- the extreme statement about killing someone is likely hyperbole to express intense frustration
- ""love waking up in the worst fcking mood"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally - no one actually loves being in a bad mood
- the ""#not"" at the end explicitly contradicts the previous statement, indicating the opposite meaning

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears negative and angry
- the true intention is to express frustration about being in a bad mood
- the use of hyperbole, the contradictory statement about ""loving"" a bad mood, and the explicit ""#not"" all point to sarcasm

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the inclusion of ""#not"" in all caps is a clear indicator that the suggestion is not meant to be taken seriously. this hashtag is commonly used to negate or contradict the statement that precedes it. the true intention is likely to mock or ridicule the idea of using old motherboards as guitar picks.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (helpful suggestion) and the true intention (mockery of the idea). the use of ""#not"" creates a deliberate contradiction between what is said and what is meant. this stark contrast between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no explicitly positive or negative words. the phrase ""just casually walking past"" implies a casual, everyday occurrence.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing surprise or excitement at seeing joe cole (likely a famous footballer) in an unexpected setting. the use of ""just casually"" suggests that this is not a normal occurrence and is meant to highlight the contrast between the casual nature of the action and the celebrity status of joe cole.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle mismatch between the casual tone of the statement and the likely excitement of the speaker. however, this doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm. it's more likely a form of understatement used to emphasize the unexpected nature of the encounter.

- the tweet expresses stress and frustration about a buffering video feed
- the phrase ""very stressful"" indicates negative emotion
- the use of ""...?!"" at the end suggests heightened emotion or exasperation
- the question format ""am i the only one"" implies seeking validation or shared experience

- the question format may be rhetorical, implying that others must also find this stressful
- there's no clear indication of exaggeration or irony that would suggest sarcasm
- the emotion seems proportionate to the situation (an important space launch being interrupted by technical issues)

the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis

"@Esmerodo @MonteMcNaughton @MacLeodLisa Yes, and conventional taxis drive verrrry safely. #pfft #sarcasm",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

i'm confident in this judgment for the following reasons:

1. the use of exaggerated spelling ""verrrry"" is a common indicator of sarcasm, especially when describing something positively that is likely not true.

2. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly used, which is a clear indicator that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

3. the hashtag ""#pfft"" is an expression of dismissal or disbelief, further reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

4. the context suggests that the author is criticizing conventional taxis by sarcastically claiming they drive very safely, when the intended meaning is likely the opposite.

these clear markers make it highly evident that the tweet is sarcastic, without the need for a step-by-step analysis.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""#greatmorning"" suggesting a good start to the day
- the overall tone seems to be describing a series of events without explicitly negative language

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- the frustration of losing work just before completion (""about to hit send, my ipod just died"")
- the use of ""#not"" at the end, which is a common way to negate the previous statement
- the word ""rant"" implies a negative emotional state

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the seemingly positive ""#greatmorning"" and the actual negative experience described. the use of ""#not"" explicitly reverses the meaning of the previous hashtag, confirming the sarcastic intent. the author is using false positivity to emphasize their actual frustration and disappointment.

based on this analysis, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

- but it also indicates a positive purpose (""to given us a lesson"")
- overall, the surface sentiment is mixed, leaning towards a thoughtful or philosophical tone

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet mentions obama and hillary making a promise to ukraine about protection.
- the phrase ""need to keep at least one promise"" suggests disappointment or criticism.
- on the surface, it appears to be a straightforward criticism of unfulfilled promises.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""need to keep at least one promise"" implies that multiple promises were made and not kept.
- the use of ""at least one"" is likely an exaggeration to emphasize perceived failures.
- the tweet seems to be criticizing obama and hillary's foreign policy regarding ukraine.
- there's an implication that ukraine was left vulnerable after following advice to disarm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface criticism aligns with the true intention, but the language used is more biting than it first appears.
- the exaggeration of ""at least one promise"" is a common sarcastic device.
- the tweet uses understated language to convey a stronger criticism, which is characteristic of sarcasm.
- the overall tone is mocking and critical, using irony to highlight perceived policy failures.

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""i just enjoy throwing up"" suggests a positive feeling towards being sick. the hashtags ""#wanna #go #to #school #for #once"" also imply a desire to attend school.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely the opposite of what's stated. ""throwing up"" is generally an unpleasant experience that people do not enjoy. the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator that the statement is meant to be interpreted in the opposite way. ""#hatethis"" and ""#sick"" further reinforce the negative sentiment. the excessive use of hashtags, especially breaking up a phrase into individual word hashtags, often indicates sarcasm or exaggeration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (enjoying being sick, wanting to go to school) and the true intention (hating being sick, not wanting to go to school). the use of ""#not"" explicitly signals that the statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning. the exaggerated use of hashtags further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

- ""i actually think"" suggests a sincere opinion
- ""he needs to use"" implies a recommendation or agreement with a course of action

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism or disagreement:
- the use of ""reincarnation"" is unusual and likely metaphorical, possibly implying a negative view of the situation
- the hashtag ""#irony"" at the end explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the seemingly supportive surface sentiment and the implied criticism. the use of ""#irony"" confirms that the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying. this is a classic structure for sarcasm, where a positive statement is used to convey a negative opinion.

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

- hashtags like ""#dislikes"" and ""#sad"" indicate negative sentiment
- the overall tone seems critical of liberals and leftists
- mentioning ""racist #not to support demand for #minimum wage"" appears to be calling out perceived hypocrisy

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely criticizing liberals/leftists for their perceived overuse of labels like ""racist"" and ""sexist""
- it's implying that these labels are used unfairly against those who don't support certain policies (like minimum wage)
- the true intention seems to be to point out perceived double standards or hypocrisy in liberal rhetoric

step 3: comparison and analysis

- the tweet doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or mock enthusiasm.
- the unusual hashtag use could be interpreted various ways, but there's not enough evidence to confidently label it as sarcastic.
- the primary purpose appears to be information sharing.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""nevermind that"" suggests dismissing a previous topic.
- ""do pray tell"" is a somewhat formal or archaic way of asking for information.
- the question about scherzy (likely referring to nicole scherzinger) playing grizabella (a character from the musical ""cats"") seems straightforward.
- overall, the surface sentiment appears neutral to mildly curious.

step 2: true intention
- ""nevermind that"" could be dismissive or redirecting attention.
- ""do pray tell"" often has a sarcastic or exaggerated tone in modern usage, implying skepticism or mock interest.
- the question about scherzinger playing grizabella might be rhetorical or expressing doubt about the casting.
- the overall tone seems to be one of skepticism or mild mockery.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment appears neutral, the true intention seems to carry a sarcastic undertone.
- the use of ""do pray tell"" is a key indicator of sarcasm, as it's often used ironically.
- the abrupt topic change with ""nevermind that"" followed by a seemingly unrelated question about casting suggests the speaker might not be genuinely interested in the answer.
- the context (likely about a musical or casting decision) and the way the question is framed imply criticism or doubt wrapped in politeness.

Everyone wants the truth but nobody wants to be honest... #irony,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or critical. the statement points out a contradiction in human behavior, which could be seen as a critique of society. the use of ""but"" indicates a contrast between two ideas, suggesting complexity in the sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting hypocrisy or inconsistency in human nature. the statement implies that while people claim to value truth, they often fail to practice honesty themselves. the use of the hashtag #irony at the end is a clear indicator that the author is pointing out this contradiction intentionally and wants the reader to recognize the irony in the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is critical, the true intention goes beyond simple criticism to highlight irony. the use of the #irony hashtag explicitly signals the author's intent to point out the contradiction between desiring truth and lacking honesty. this deliberate highlighting of irony, combined with the concise and pointed nature of the statement, strongly suggests a sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis

the true intention is actually to highlight the irony of the situation. the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#middlechildsyndrome"" are key indicators here. the author is implying that despite sharing the trait of being middle children, this commonality doesn't actually improve their relationship. the use of ""you think"" at the beginning also suggests skepticism about the idea.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
- neutral to slightly negative tone due to words like ""mad"" and ""hide a secret""
- no overtly positive or negative emojis or phrases
- hashtags #irony and #agentsofshield provide context but don't indicate clear sentiment

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""that time when"" suggests referencing a specific event, likely from the tv show agents of s.h.i.e.l.d.
- the use of ""#irony"" is a strong indicator that the tweet is pointing out a contradictory or hypocritical situation
- the tweet seems to be highlighting a contradiction in the character ward's behavior - he was upset about skye hiding a secret, implying that ward himself likely hid secrets as well

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, but the true intention is to point out irony or hypocrisy
- the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the tweet is meant to be understood as ironic or sarcastic
- the tweet is using the situation to comment on the character's contradictory behavior, which is a common form of sarcasm

based on this analysis, particularly the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the implied contradiction in ward's behavior, i can confidently label this tweet as:

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and celebratory, with phrases like ""we applauded ourselves"" suggesting pride and accomplishment regarding the moon landing. 

step 2: true intention
the mention of carl sagan speaking ""a truth we all denied"" introduces a contrasting perspective. this suggests that despite the celebration, there was an important truth or critique that was being ignored. the inclusion of ""#irony"" at the end further indicates that the true meaning is different from the surface sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the initial celebratory tone and the implication that an important truth was being denied. the use of ""#irony"" confirms that the statement is meant to be taken ironically. the tweet seems to be critiquing the self-congratulatory attitude towards the moon landing while ignoring more significant truths or issues pointed out by carl sagan.

- enthusiastic tone: use of double question marks ""??""
- multiple hashtags suggesting enjoyment and fashion (#happytimes, #sundayout, #mewearing, etc.)
- reference to luxury brand (chanel)

the surface sentiment appears very positive and enthusiastic about holidays and fashion.

- the link at the end likely leads to a photo of the poster enjoying their holiday or showing off their outfit

the true intention seems to be sharing a moment of enjoyment and possibly promoting a fashionable lifestyle.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention align well
- there's no indication of mockery, criticism, or contrast between what's said and meant
- the rhetorical question about holidays lasting forever seems more wistful than sarcastic
- the overall tone is consistent with genuine enthusiasm about the holiday and fashion experience

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""not worried about it"" suggests a neutral or positive sentiment
- ""whenevs"" is casual slang for ""whenever,"" implying a relaxed attitude
- the winking face emoji 😉 typically indicates friendliness, playfulness, or shared understanding

the surface sentiment appears positive and casual.

step 2: true intention
- ""not worried about it"" could be genuine or could potentially downplay concern
- ""whenevs"" reinforces a casual, easygoing attitude
- the winking emoji 😉 can sometimes be used to indicate that there's more to the message than what's explicitly stated

the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment, but the winking emoji adds a layer of potential complexity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention
- the casual tone and winking emoji don't strongly suggest sarcasm
- while the winking emoji could potentially indicate a hidden meaning, it's more likely used here to reinforce the casual, friendly tone
- the context (responding to another user) suggests this is probably a genuine, friendly interaction

given this analysis, while there's a slight possibility of subtle sarcasm, the message appears more likely to be genuine.

### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and agreeable. the use of ""hahaha,"" laughing emojis (😂😂😂), and the phrase ""loves her with all her heart"" all suggest a positive, amicable tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually negative and contradictory to the surface sentiment. this is evident from:
1. the use of all-caps ""not"" at the end, which is a common way to negate everything said before.
2. the gun emoji (🔫) following ""not,"" which further emphasizes the negative sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the initially positive surface sentiment and the abrupt negation at the end. this deliberate mismatch between the expressed sentiment and the true intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is using exaggerated positive language only to completely reverse it, creating a sarcastic effect.

step 1: surface sentiment
- negative keywords: ""not good"", ""stealing""
- capitalization for emphasis: ""not"", ""good"", ""reputation"", ""stealing""
- use of hashtags to highlight negative aspects
- ambiguous tone: the winking emoticon ""(;"" at the end could indicate playfulness or threat

step 2: true intention
- the tweet seems to be calling out someone for stealing from girls
- mentioning ""@hausofse7en & mr. mason"" appears to be directly addressing the accused parties
- ""expect a call"" implies a threat or warning of consequences
- the winking emoticon at the end could be interpreted as a mocking or threatening gesture

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention largely align in their negative tone
- the capitalization and hashtags serve to emphasize the seriousness of the accusation rather than create irony
- while the winking emoticon adds a layer of ambiguity, it doesn't clearly reverse the meaning of the statement
- the overall message appears to be a genuine warning or callout, rather than a sarcastic comment

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is not sarcastic, but rather a direct accusation or warning with a slightly playful or threatening tone at the end.

- #adamsmith and #specialization could suggest an economic or sociological perspective
- overall, the surface sentiment seems to be matter-of-fact or even supportive of strippers

- neutral to slightly positive: the tweet mentions dollar amounts and uses hashtags like #lockitin and #bankopen which suggest financial activity or gains.
- the hashtag #not criminal could be read as a denial of criminal activity.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be referencing some sort of gambling or betting activity (obx, gboro, #lottoclub).
- the use of #lockitin suggests confidence in a bet or prediction.
- #doumenturdeposit is likely a misspelling of ""document your deposit,"" implying a record of the transaction.
- #not criminal seems to be a tongue-in-cheek comment, possibly acknowledging that the activity might be viewed as questionable.
- the inclusion of a link suggests sharing evidence or results of the activity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a subtle mismatch between the surface neutrality and the underlying implication of potentially dubious activity.
- the use of #not criminal is likely intended to be humorous or ironic, subtly acknowledging that the activity might be seen as borderline legal or ethical.
- the overall tone seems casual and boastful, with an undercurrent of self-awareness about the nature of the activity.

given this analysis, the tweet appears to contain elements of sarcasm, particularly in the use of #not criminal. the author seems to be playfully acknowledging the questionable nature of their activities while simultaneously bragging about them.

I may or may not have put @robertashton1 at the top of @swarm_tweets tree soon as he likes Christmas time... #Sarcasm http://t.co/OMOURvLfzt,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","for this input, i'll walk through the steps as there are some nuanced elements to consider:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""may or may not have"" suggests a playful or teasing tone. putting someone at the top of a tree (presumably a christmas tree) could be seen as a fun or festive action, especially given the mention of ""christmas time.""

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is sarcastic:
- the phrase ""may or may not have"" is often used in a coy or sarcastic manner.
- putting someone ""at the top of @swarm_tweets tree"" is likely not meant literally, but as a metaphorical or joking statement.
- the explicit use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet clearly indicates the author's intention for the statement to be interpreted as sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears playful or neutral, the true intention is clearly sarcastic. the author is using a seemingly positive or neutral statement to convey a sarcastic message, likely poking fun at @robertashton1's enthusiasm for christmas. the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag removes any ambiguity about the author's intent.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""we're cool as fuck"" expresses a very positive, confident sentiment
- ""judge me"" could be interpreted as defiant or challenging
- the use of ""acronyms"" and the linked image suggest a casual, trendy tone
- overall, the surface sentiment appears to be bold and self-assured

step 2: true intention
- the extreme language (""cool as fuck"") and the challenging ""judge me"" hint at potential exaggeration
- the use of ""acronyms"" at the beginning seems abrupt and potentially mocking
- the link to an image suggests this might be commentary on a specific trend or behavior
- the true intention appears to be critiquing or mocking the overuse of acronyms or the attempt to appear ""cool"" through their use

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a disconnect between the surface sentiment (very positive, cool) and the likely true intention (mocking, critical)
- the exaggerated language and the challenging tone are typical markers of sarcasm
- the abrupt start with ""acronyms"" followed by an explanation feels like setup for a sarcastic comment

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive keywords: ""true"", ""understand"", ""teamwork""
- hashtags like ""#hardcore"" and ""#teamwork"" suggest a positive, strong sentiment
- the phrase ""only a true nightshift person would understand"" implies exclusivity and pride

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""#not"" contradicts the preceding positive sentiment
- ""#always"" with an ellipsis (...) suggests doubt or contradiction
- the structure ""only a true x would understand"" is often used sarcastically to mock or criticize
- the inclusion of a link implies there might be additional context or a contradictory image/content

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears positive and proud, but the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing aspects of nightshift work
- the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, contradicting the apparently positive statements
- the structure and tone of the tweet align with common sarcastic patterns

based on this analysis, we can conclude:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out the contradiction or absurdity of the situation. the person is approaching adulthood (last year before 18) but still receiving ""santa's gifts,"" which are typically associated with younger children. the confusion about what to ask for might suggest they've outgrown this tradition. the explicit use of ""#irony"" indicates the author is aware of and highlighting this contradiction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of continuing a childhood tradition contrasts with the underlying acknowledgment that the person has outgrown it. the explicit labeling of the situation as ironic with the hashtag ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author intends this to be read as sarcastic or ironic commentary on their situation.

given this analysis, especially the explicit use of ""#irony"" and the contradiction between approaching adulthood and maintaining childhood traditions, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

label: not sarcastic

explanation: the statement ""i'm really excited for next semester"" appears to be a genuine expression of positive anticipation. there are no contextual clues or linguistic features that suggest sarcasm. the use of ""really"" emphasizes the excitement, and without any contradictory information or tone indicators, it's reasonable to interpret this statement as sincere enthusiasm for the upcoming academic term.",0.0

- the tone is lighthearted and humorous
- no overtly negative or critical keywords are present

step 2: true intention

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention
- there's no significant mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning
- the humor is derived from exaggeration and absurdity, not from saying one thing and meaning the opposite

        ","for this input, i'll need to think through it step-by-step as the context and intention aren't immediately clear.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears serious and critical.
- it mentions potentially controversial topics like abortion and voting.
- the tone seems informative but with a negative undercurrent.
- no overtly sarcastic language or emojis are present.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be criticizing a political figure (likely obama, referred to as ""o"") for their stance on abortion.
- the mention of ""4th trimester abortions"" is noteworthy, as this is not a medically recognized term.
- the true intention seems to be to express strong disagreement with certain abortion policies and to paint them in an extreme light.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment largely aligns with the true intention - both are critical and serious in tone.
- the use of ""4th trimester abortions"" could be seen as hyperbole to emphasize the speaker's point, but it doesn't appear to be sarcastic in nature.
- the overall message seems to be a genuine expression of the author's views, rather than a sarcastic comment.

based on this analysis, i conclude that the tweet is:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- negative element: ""to be an ass""
- positive element: ""ohh yeaa!!!!"" (enthusiastic exclamation)
- the surface sentiment is mixed, with a negative self-description followed by enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""to be an ass"" appears to be self-deprecating or acknowledging potentially negative behavior
- ""ohh yeaa!!!!"" suggests genuine excitement or approval
- the link at the end implies sharing content the user finds interesting or agreeable
- the overall tone seems casual and genuine rather than ironic

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention
- the tweet doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or mock enthusiasm
- the combination of self-deprecation and excitement is more likely genuine than sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive elements: ""good luck""
- negative elements: none explicitly stated
- neutral elements: ""lol"" (could be interpreted various ways)
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive or neutral.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""good luck finding someone"" often implies that the task is difficult or impossible
- ""to take the other side of that bet"" suggests the speaker believes the opposite stance is unlikely or foolish
- ""lol"" (laugh out loud) in this context likely indicates mockery or derision
- the overall tone seems to be dismissive and skeptical of the idea that anyone would take the opposing view

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (""good luck"") and the true intention (implying impossibility or foolishness)
- the use of ""good luck"" is likely insincere and meant to emphasize the perceived difficulty or absurdity of the task
- the addition of ""lol"" further reinforces the mocking tone
- this tweet employs typical sarcastic devices, particularly the use of a positive phrase (""good luck"") to convey a negative sentiment

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""it is good that"" explicitly states a positive evaluation. the content suggests that few businesses and governments in emerging market economies have taken on significant dollar-denominated loans, which is presented as a positive situation.

step 2: true intention
the presence of ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the tweet immediately indicates that the true intention is the opposite of what's stated. the author is actually implying that it is bad or concerning that many businesses and governments in emerging market economies have likely borrowed heavily in dollar-denominated loans from international banks.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface positive sentiment in step 1 and the true negative implication revealed in step 2. the author uses sarcasm to highlight a potentially serious economic issue. the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag removes any ambiguity about the intent.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the text ""short hair"" is neutral.
- the hashtag ""#really"" could potentially indicate emphasis or skepticism.
- there's a link, which likely leads to an image or more information.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be a straightforward comment about short hair.
- the ""#really"" hashtag, in this context, likely emphasizes the short hair rather than expressing doubt or sarcasm.
- the link probably shows an image of the short hair being referred to.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the tweet appears to be a sincere endorsement of fitness-related content. here's a brief explanation:

1. the use of the raised hands emoji (🙌🙌) typically indicates enthusiasm or celebration.
2. the inclusion of a link (http://t.co/ptl2nsnffo) suggests sharing of content, likely fitness-related.
3. the hashtags #fitfam, #fitness, and #health are commonly used in genuine fitness and health-related posts.
4. there are no linguistic cues or context that would suggest sarcasm or irony.

the overall tone and content of the tweet align with typical, sincere social media posts promoting fitness and health, hence the classification as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet states ""#gta #san #andreas #2 #is #not #coming #in #2015""
- this appears to be a straightforward negative statement
- the use of many hashtags is notable but doesn't inherently convey sentiment
- the additional text provides context about a media release, which seems neutral in tone

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is actually debunking a rumor or false information
- the phrase ""one media has released that gta san andreas 2 is coming in 2015"" contradicts the initial statement
- the inclusion of a link suggests the tweet is providing more information on this topic
- the true intention seems to be to correct misinformation and provide accurate news to followers

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a slight discrepancy between the initial statement and the explanation that follows
- however, this doesn't appear to be sarcastic, but rather a clarification of facts
- the tweet is structured to first state the correct information, then explain the source of the misinformation
- the use of multiple hashtags might be to increase visibility, not to convey sarcasm

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with words like ""liberated"" and ""thank you, western liberators"" suggesting gratitude and appreciation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and condemn the western intervention in iraq. the author uses quotation marks around ""liberated"" to question this claim, then presents stark statistics about casualties. the phrase ""thank you, western liberators"" is actually meant to blame and criticize those who claimed to liberate iraq.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment of gratitude and the true intention of criticism and condemnation. the use of ""thank you"" in conjunction with devastating statistics is clearly meant to be ironic. the explicit #sarcasm hashtag at the end confirms the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears to be negative, asking to tag a teammate who is ""so bad""
- it suggests this player ""runs the line every week"", implying poor performance
- the phrase ""i'm sorry to say"" seems to express regret or apology
- overall, the surface sentiment appears critical and negative

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely meant to be playful or teasing rather than genuinely critical
- tagging a specific teammate (@sam__clough) suggests this is probably friendly banter
- the use of ""i'm sorry to say"" is likely not genuine regret, but a rhetorical device to emphasize the joke
- the context of sports teams often involves good-natured teasing among teammates

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the surface negativity and the likely playful intention
- the exaggerated language (""so bad"") and the public nature of the tweet suggest it's not meant to be taken literally
- the apology ""i'm sorry to say"" contrasts with the act of publicly calling out a teammate, indicating irony
- this kind of playful exaggeration and mock criticism is a common form of sarcasm, especially in sports contexts

step 1: surface sentiment
- ""easiest cl group"" suggests a positive sentiment
- ""two rubbish teams"" is negative
- ""won only 1 cl game"" is negative
- ""lucky last minute pen"" could be seen as positive (lucky) but in context seems negative
- ""#not good enough"" and ""#gutted"" are clearly negative

the overall surface sentiment is mixed but leans negative.

step 2: true intention
the tweet is expressing disappointment and frustration. the speaker is saying that despite having an easy group in the champions league (cl), their team performed poorly, winning only one game, and even that was due to luck. the hashtags reinforce the negative sentiment.

the phrase ""easiest cl group"" is used to emphasize how poor the performance was, given the perceived low difficulty of the opponents.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a contrast between the initial positive phrase ""easiest cl group"" and the rest of the tweet, which is overwhelmingly negative. this contrast is intentional to highlight the disappointment.

while there's an element of irony in describing the group as ""easy"" and then detailing poor performance, this doesn't appear to be sarcasm in the traditional sense. the speaker seems to genuinely believe the group was easy and is genuinely expressing disappointment at the team's performance.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm
- the tweet likely means the joke was actually terrible or inappropriate, not genuinely good

several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

""thanks to all"" appears positive, but is followed by a criticism of those who ""claim to cover wvhs hoop"". the ""#not"" hashtag is explicitly negative. the second part about the highlanders winning seems positive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be criticism of those who claim to cover the high school basketball team but apparently didn't report on an exciting last-second win. the ""#not"" hashtag explicitly negates the thanks, indicating that the gratitude is not genuine. the contrast between the criticism and the exciting game result emphasizes the poster's frustration with the lack of coverage.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface ""thanks"" sharply contrasts with the true intention of criticism. the use of ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly reversing the meaning of the preceding statement. the juxtaposition of the criticism with the exciting game result further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive.
- the phrase ""please let me know"" and ""thanks"" indicate politeness and gratitude.
- there's no overtly negative or positive language used.

step 2: true intention
- the request for people who can ""talk power-dressing and social media marketing"" seems oddly specific.
- combining ""power-dressing"" (an older concept) with ""social media marketing"" (a more modern field) creates an unusual juxtaposition.
- the phrasing ""could talk"" rather than ""are experts in"" or ""have experience with"" suggests a focus on the ability to discuss these topics rather than actual expertise.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment is polite and straightforward, the true intention seems to be making a subtle criticism or joke about people who talk about these topics without necessarily having substantial knowledge or experience.
- the combination of an old-fashioned concept (power-dressing) with a modern one (social media marketing) could be seen as a gentle mockery of buzzword-heavy business talk.
- the focus on being able to ""talk"" about these topics rather than having genuine expertise suggests a criticism of superficial knowledge or posturing in professional settings.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

i'm confident in this judgment without needing to go through the steps, but here's a brief explanation:

the statement ""i love getting up at 4:30 so i can wait on other ppl!"" is clearly sarcastic. most people don't enjoy waking up very early, especially to wait on others. the use of ""love"" here is ironic. additionally, the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly confirms the sarcastic intent of the statement.",1.0

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the text ""short hair"" is neutral.
- the hashtag ""#really"" could potentially indicate emphasis or skepticism.
- there's a link, which likely leads to an image or more information.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be a straightforward comment about short hair.
- the ""#really"" hashtag, in this context, likely emphasizes the short hair rather than expressing doubt or sarcasm.
- the link probably shows an image of the short hair being referred to.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears contradictory. the speaker expresses a desire to connect, but then states a preference for people who don't want to connect. the use of hashtags #irony and #why oh why? suggests frustration or confusion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or irony about the paradoxical nature of human connections. the speaker is likely commenting on the tendency to be attracted to those who are less available or interested in connecting.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the stated desire to connect and the preference for those who don't want to connect. this contradiction, coupled with the use of the #irony hashtag, strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to highlight the complexity and sometimes contradictory nature of human relationships and desires.

the true intention is likely not actually helpful. suggesting yelling at a leaf blowing in the breeze is an absurd and pointless action. this implies that the speaker is mocking or making light of the other person's desire to yell or express frustration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (seemingly helpful suggestion) and the true intention (mockery or pointing out absurdity). the suggestion is deliberately unhelpful and nonsensical, which is a common feature of sarcastic statements. the speaker is using this absurd suggestion to indirectly comment on the pointlessness of the other person's apparent desire to yell or be angry.

the true intention is likely not genuine surprise, but rather to point out the absurdity of such a generalization. the inclusion of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the question is likely rhetorical, meant to highlight and mock stereotyping or overgeneralization.

step 2: true intention

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true context. the cute, affectionate response is inappropriate given the serious nature of the news about invasion of privacy and sleep deprivation. this mismatch suggests that the commenter is likely being sarcastic, using an exaggeratedly sweet tone to mock either the situation or the overzealous fans.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""that's always the solution"" initially appears positive, suggesting agreement or endorsement.
- the use of multiple periods (""....."") could indicate emphasis or trailing thoughts.
- ""#not"" is a common hashtag used to negate the previous statement.
- ""doesn't fix anything!"" has a negative tone, expressing frustration or disagreement.

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""that's always the solution"" followed by ""#not"" is a clear indication of sarcasm. the author is actually saying that the unnamed solution is not effective at all.
- ""doesn't fix anything!"" reinforces the true negative sentiment, explicitly stating that the supposed solution is ineffective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface-level agreement in the first part (""that's always the solution"") is completely contradicted by the ""#not"" and the following statement.
- this stark contrast between the initial seemingly positive statement and the actual negative meaning is a classic sarcastic structure.
- the use of ""#not"" is a well-known sarcastic device used to invert the meaning of the preceding statement.

based on this analysis, the label is clearly:

### Example:
Input: ""auntie just called and said shes on her way..|i better get dressed then :astonished_face::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part is neutral, stating a fact about auntie calling.
- the second part expresses surprise and amusement with the astonished face and laughing emojis.
- the phrase ""i better get dressed then"" could be read as slightly exasperated, but the emojis suggest it's meant lightheartedly.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is genuinely informing about their aunt's imminent arrival.
- they're humorously acknowledging that they're not fully prepared (not dressed yet).
- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention.
- there's no contradiction between the words and the emojis.
- the humor is self-deprecating rather than sarcastic towards others.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","to analyze this tweet for sarcasm, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet is phrased as a request for information
- no overtly positive or negative sentiment words are used
- the use of hashtags (#excuse, #not, #workout) adds emphasis to key concepts

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is not actually seeking information, but rather making a point
- the phrase ""name an #excuse"" implies that there are many excuses people use
- using ""#not"" in conjunction with ""#workout"" suggests that these are excuses for not exercising
- the linked content (http://t.co/te75pwpgbm) likely contains related information or commentary

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface request for information contrasts with the implied criticism of people making excuses
- the use of hashtags, especially ""#not,"" adds a layer of irony to the tweet
- the tweet is using a rhetorical question to make a point about people's behavior regarding exercise

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm
- the tweet likely means the joke was actually terrible or inappropriate, not genuinely good

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""left regressives"" is presented as a label
- the use of hashtag #irony explicitly calls attention to irony in the statement
- the question format ""is that not a label"" suggests skepticism or criticism

step 2: true intention

- the question ""is that not a label"" is rhetorical, implying that it is indeed a label
- the hashtag #irony confirms that the author sees irony in this situation

step 3: compare and analyze

- the true intention is to highlight the irony of using a label while presumably arguing against labels
- the use of irony and the rhetorical question structure strongly suggest sarcasm

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears to be defending a slow coaching search process
- it suggests that 3 weeks is not enough time to hire a coach
- the question ""who moves that quickly on a coaching search?"" implies that fast hiring is unusual

step 2: true intention
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end clearly indicates the tweet is meant sarcastically
- the true intention is likely to criticize a slow coaching search process
- the rhetorical question is used to emphasize how absurdly slow the process is, not to actually defend it

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (defending slow hiring) and the true intention (criticizing slow hiring)
- the use of exaggeration (""who moves that quickly"") and the explicit sarcasm tag make the true meaning clear
- the sarcasm is used to highlight frustration with what the author sees as an unnecessarily prolonged hiring process

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be factual and straightforward. the use of ""#fact"" suggests that the statement is meant to be taken as truthful information. the inclusion of ""#teamfollowback"" indicates a desire for social media engagement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is more complex. the definition provided for a celebrity is circular and somewhat nonsensical - ""known for his well-knownness."" this tautological definition is likely intended to critique the nature of celebrity culture. the use of ""#irony"" at the end explicitly signals that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (presenting a fact) and the true intention (critiquing celebrity culture through a circular definition). the inclusion of ""#irony"" further confirms that the statement is not meant to be taken literally. the juxtaposition of ""#fact"" with an ironic statement adds to the sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly confused. the speaker is asking a genuine-sounding question about whether there's a basketball game on today, and expressing uncertainty (""i'm not really sure""). there's no overtly positive or negative language used.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear when we consider:
- the hashtag #espn (a major sports network) is mentioned
- the phrase ""seems to not be promoting anything about it"" is likely an exaggeration
- the explicit #sarcasm hashtag at the end

the speaker is actually implying that espn is heavily promoting a basketball game, to the point where it's impossible to miss.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface-level uncertainty expressed in the question and the implied reality of excessive promotion. the use of understatement (""seems to not be promoting anything"") to describe what is likely an overwhelming amount of promotion is a classic sarcastic technique. the #sarcasm hashtag confirms the speaker's intent.

- but it also indicates a positive purpose (""to given us a lesson"")
- overall, the surface sentiment is mixed, leaning towards a thoughtful or philosophical tone

step 2: true intention

- it suggests that hardships serve a purpose beyond immediate harm
- the intention seems to be to express a belief in learning from difficulties
- the phrase ""to teach to someone weaker"" implies a cycle of learning and sharing wisdom

step 3: comparison and analysis

- the tweet appears to be agreeing with the need for nhs england to publish a&e figures over the holiday period
- the use of hashtags like #agree and #publish suggests support for transparency
- however, the inclusion of #sarcasm and attributing it to #jeremyhunt raises suspicion

step 2: true intention
- the use of #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the apparent agreement is not genuine
- by attributing the sarcasm to jeremy hunt (who was the health secretary at the time), the tweet is likely criticizing hunt's stance or actions regarding nhs transparency
- the true intention seems to be expressing disagreement or frustration with the handling of nhs data publication

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the tweet appears to be genuinely questioning the subject's intelligence and criticizing her understanding of race relations. there are no clear indicators of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be humorous and self-deprecating. the speaker is taking the idiom ""world on a string"" literally, which is not how it's meant to be understood. they're jokingly asking for some of the metaphorical ""string"" as if it were a real, tangible object. the hashtag ""#whatamidoing"" further emphasizes that the speaker is aware they're saying something nonsensical.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface appears to be a genuine request, the true intention is to make a joke by deliberately misinterpreting an idiom. this mismatch between literal interpretation and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- ""get a grip"" and ""sit down"" are dismissive phrases.
- the mention of ""mopani worms"" seems out of place and contrasts with typical christmas food.

- they're suggesting that it's ""just a day"" and people are overreacting.
- the mention of mopani worms (a food not typically associated with christmas in many cultures) seems intentionally jarring, possibly to emphasize the speaker's disregard for traditional christmas customs.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear mismatch between the typical enthusiasm for christmas and the author's dismissive attitude.
- the use of strong language and dismissive phrases indicates genuine frustration.
- the sudden mention of mopani worms adds an element of absurdity that could be interpreted as sarcastic.

this tweet is straightforwardly advertising a product (a tank top) that is related to sarcasm, but the tweet itself is not employing sarcasm. it's a direct promotional message for a product that plays on the concept of sarcasm, but the message itself is sincere in its attempt to sell the item.

the hashtags #sarcasm and #funny are used descriptively to indicate the nature of the product being sold, not to create a sarcastic tone in the tweet itself. the call-to-action ""order now"" and the inclusion of a purchase link further reinforce that this is a genuine promotional tweet without sarcastic intent.",0.0

### Example:
Input: ""to be an ass but ohh yeaa!!!! http://t.co/sf8jm2zpfd""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- negative element: ""to be an ass""
- positive element: ""ohh yeaa!!!!"" (enthusiastic exclamation)
- the surface sentiment is mixed, with a negative self-description followed by enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""to be an ass"" appears to be self-deprecating or acknowledging potentially negative behavior
- ""ohh yeaa!!!!"" suggests genuine excitement or approval
- the link at the end implies sharing content the user finds interesting or agreeable
- the overall tone seems casual and genuine rather than ironic

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention
- the tweet doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or mock enthusiasm
- the combination of self-deprecation and excitement is more likely genuine than sarcastic

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement ""the #gophers aren't nervous"" appears neutral to positive on the surface.
- there are no clear sentimental keywords or emojis.
- the use of hashtags (#sammycommentary #gophers) doesn't inherently convey sentiment.

step 2: true intention
- the repeated use of ""#gophers"" suggests this is about a sports team.
- ""#sammycommentary"" implies this is part of someone's (sammy's) commentary on a game or event.
- the statement about not being nervous could be:
  a) a straightforward observation
  b) an attempt to reassure fans
  c) a sarcastic comment implying the opposite (that they are actually very nervous)

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and possible true intentions.
- the statement lacks typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, mock enthusiasm, or obvious irony.
- sports commentary often includes straightforward observations about team morale.
- without more context about the game situation or sammy's usual commentary style, it's difficult to definitively determine sarcasm.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the common nature of such statements in sports commentary, i lean towards classifying this as not sarcastic.

- but it also indicates a positive purpose (""to given us a lesson"")
- overall, the surface sentiment is mixed, leaning towards a thoughtful or philosophical tone

- it suggests that hardships serve a purpose beyond immediate harm
- the intention seems to be to express a belief in learning from difficulties
- the phrase ""to teach to someone weaker"" implies a cycle of learning and sharing wisdom

step 3: comparison and analysis

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""bitches be like"" is often used colloquially to mock or criticize behavior
- the hashtags ""#more #appointments #please"" suggest enthusiasm for appointments
- ""#not#crazy#enough"" implies a self-awareness about mental state
- ""yet"" in all caps suggests emphasis or a turning point
- the location tag at an orthodontist adds context

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""bitches be like"" is likely not literal, but a way to introduce a stereotype or behavior
- the enthusiasm for appointments is probably not genuine, given the context
- the hashtags about not being crazy enough yet, combined with being at an orthodontist, suggest frustration or annoyance with multiple appointments
- the overall tone seems to be one of exasperation or frustration masked by fake enthusiasm

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of enthusiasm for appointments clashes with the underlying frustration
- the use of stereotypical phrasing and exaggerated hashtags suggests a mocking tone
- the juxtaposition of wanting more appointments and implying increasing craziness indicates irony
- the overall message seems to be criticizing the need for multiple orthodontic appointments through sarcastic enthusiasm

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

I am so glad that I woke up early for this office visit to have to the mother not show up! #not,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""i am so glad,"" which typically expresses happiness or satisfaction.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
- waking up early is generally considered unpleasant.
- the phrase ""have to"" suggests obligation rather than choice.
- the mother not showing up for an office visit would likely be frustrating.
- the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of negating the previous statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""i am so glad"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about the situation. the use of ""#not"" explicitly confirms that the speaker means the opposite of what they said. this mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention, along with the explicit negation, clearly indicates sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step, as this tweet requires careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is extremely negative. key phrases like ""sickens me"" and ""killing innocent black men & children"" express strong disgust and outrage. the word ""lucrative"" is typically positive, but its juxtaposition with the violent context creates a jarring contrast.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and condemn systemic racism and police brutality in america. the author is using bitter irony to highlight the perceived injustice that those responsible for killing black individuals often face no consequences and may even benefit from these actions. the hashtags reference specific high-profile cases of black men and boys killed by police or vigilantes.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the surface use of ""lucrative career"" and the horrific acts described. this juxtaposition is intentional and serves to emphasize the author's outrage. the tweet employs dark sarcasm to make a powerful point about racial injustice. the author doesn't literally mean that killing is a career, but is using this phrasing sarcastically to highlight the perceived lack of accountability and consequences for those responsible.

- the second part expresses surprise and amusement with the astonished face and laughing emojis.

- they're humorously acknowledging that they're not fully prepared (not dressed yet).
- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 3: comparison and analysis

- there's no contradiction between the words and the emojis.
- the humor is self-deprecating rather than sarcastic towards others.

- ""get a wee bit more"" is a casual, friendly way of suggesting improvement
- ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end adds a light-hearted or humorous tone
- overall, the surface sentiment seems friendly and mildly encouraging

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""really"" could be emphasizing genuine advice or could be exaggerating for effect
- ""wee bit"" minimizes the suggested improvement, which could be sincere or could be downplaying for sarcastic effect
- ""lol"" at the end could indicate genuine amusement or could be softening a sarcastic comment
- the casual language and abbreviations (u, lol) suggest a familiar, informal relationship between the writer and @railwaysloth

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's some ambiguity between the surface sentiment and possible true intentions
- the combination of ""really need to"" with ""wee bit"" creates a slight contradiction that could indicate sarcasm
- the addition of ""lol"" at the end adds to the possibility of a sarcastic tone

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly uncertain. the phrase ""#not sure"" directly expresses uncertainty. there's no overtly positive or negative language used.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is less clear-cut. the use of ""#not sure"" as a hashtag, rather than simply stating ""i'm not sure,"" could potentially indicate a different meaning. in the context of a competition or contest (implied by ""who will take it home""), expressing uncertainty might actually be a way of building suspense or excitement, rather than genuine uncertainty.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle mismatch between the surface uncertainty and the potential underlying intention. the use of the hashtag format for expressing uncertainty could be seen as a playful or exaggerated way of discussing what might be an exciting or close competition. however, this discrepancy is quite subtle and not definitively sarcastic.

given the subtle nature of the potential sarcasm and the lack of clear indicators, i don't have high confidence in labeling this as sarcastic. the safest interpretation is to take the statement at face value.

the surface sentiment appears mixed. the first sentence describes negative emotions and experiences (crying, lack of sleep, stress, anxiety). however, the second sentence ""today's gonna be a good one..."" seems positive on the surface.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly negative. the author is describing a very difficult emotional state and challenging circumstances. the phrase ""today's gonna be a good one..."" is followed by ""#not"", which is a common indicator of sarcasm on social media. this hashtag explicitly contradicts and negates the seemingly positive statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the overtly negative first sentence and the superficially positive second sentence. the addition of ""#not"" confirms that the second sentence is meant sarcastically. the author is using sarcasm to emphasize how bad they expect the day to be, given their current emotional state and circumstances.

### Example:
Input: ""@outsilver87 @lasvegascapper ya, because if history has told us anything, it's that betting on sports is a great way to make money!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""ya"" (informal ""yes"") and ""great"" in all caps suggests strong agreement and enthusiasm.
- the phrase ""betting on sports is a great way to make money"" appears to be a positive statement about sports betting.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if history has told us anything"" is often used to introduce a contradictory statement.
- the exaggerated use of ""great"" in all caps hints at overstatement.
- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overly positive about sports betting.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

i'm confident in this judgment for the following reasons:

1. the phrase ""don't you just love..."" is a common sarcastic opener, typically used to introduce something the speaker actually dislikes.

2. the description that follows is clearly negative behavior (people who won't shut up and hold everyone back), which contrasts with the positive sentiment of ""love.""

3. the tweet explicitly includes the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end, which is a direct indicator that the statement is intended to be sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic. key phrases like ""i agree totally"", ""we need more #guns"", and ""santa is bringing me one"" suggest excitement and support for guns. the use of capitalized ""believe"" and ""more"" adds emphasis to this seemingly positive stance.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment:
1. the tweet explicitly mentions ""#sarcasm""
2. the extreme nature of the statements (""we need more #guns, not less"")
3. the casual mention of santa bringing a gun, which seems deliberately absurd
4. the context of responding to another user, likely in disagreement

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm for guns sharply contrasts with the likely true intention of criticizing pro-gun stances. the explicit mention of sarcasm, combined with the exaggerated statements, clearly indicates that the author is using irony to mock pro-gun arguments.

        ","given the complexity of this tweet and its potential for sarcasm, i'll analyze it step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet presents information about a congressional report on torture
- it states that the report confirms al-qaeda was not involved in the september 11 attacks
- the tone appears neutral and informative
- multiple hashtags are used, which could indicate emphasis on key points

step 2: true intention
- the claim that al-qaeda was not involved in the 9/11 attacks is highly controversial and contradicts widely accepted historical facts
- the use of a link suggests the tweet is sharing an article or resource related to this claim
- the heavy use of hashtags could be seen as overly emphasizing each word, potentially indicating mockery or disbelief

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears neutral and informative, but the content is highly controversial
- the claim made in the tweet contradicts well-established facts about 9/11, which is a red flag for potential sarcasm
- the excessive use of hashtags could be interpreted as a way to mock or emphasize the absurdity of the claim
- given the historical context and the widely accepted understanding of al-qaeda's involvement in 9/11, it's highly likely that this tweet is meant to be sarcastic, possibly criticizing the credibility of the report or the way it's being interpreted

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive sentiment expressed through ""makes you mentally stronger""
- describes sarcasm as ""very effective"" for dealing with stress and frustration
- use of hashtags like #funfact suggests presenting this as a positive, interesting piece of information

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the beginning immediately signals that this statement itself may be sarcastic
- the claim that sarcasm helps with emotional stress and frustration is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement
- ""#whatifisay"" at the end further hints that the speaker doesn't actually believe what they're saying

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment presents sarcasm as a positive tool for mental strength and emotional management
- however, the true intention appears to be mocking this idea
- the use of hashtags like #sarcasm and #whatifisay frame the entire statement as a sarcastic comment
- the exaggerated claim about sarcasm's benefits doesn't align with common understanding of healthy emotional coping mechanisms

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

When I'm lacking inspiration I resort to scribbling angry/pretty things. Great start to the week! #sarcasm http://t.co/5QUSrZYBqA,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- the phrase ""'nuff"" (likely short for ""enough"") could indicate a strong feeling, but it's ambiguous without context

- the tweet appears to be sharing content related to bob ross, likely a tattoo
- the hashtags are oddly formatted and don't follow typical usage (#couldn039t seems to be a coding error for an apostrophe)
- ""please rt"" is a direct request for engagement
- the inclusion of two links suggests the main purpose is to share visual content

- there's no clear discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention
- the tweet seems genuinely aimed at sharing content rather than making a sarcastic statement
- while the formatting is unusual, it doesn't appear to be intentionally ironic or mocking

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step due to the complexity of the tweet:

step 1: surface sentiment
- negative keywords: ""heartless"", ""dumb""
- hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates sarcasm
- phrase ""deserves to be taken for a ride"" suggests negativity
- #indiawithpakistan could be seen as positive on the surface

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is a quote or retweet of another user (@retributions)
- ""heartless sanghi"" is likely a criticism of the original tweeter's stance
- #indiawithpakistan is used ironically, not as genuine support
- the true message is critical of india's stance towards pakistan
- reference to #lakhvi (likely zaki-ur-rehman lakhvi, a terrorist) adds context of criticism

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention are misaligned
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the content
- the tweet employs irony to criticize india's perceived naivety in relations with pakistan
- the language is deliberately provocative and mocking

label: sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""i guess... is cool"" typically indicates approval or a positive attitude. 

step 2: true intention
however, the hashtag ""#not"" at the end completely reverses the meaning. this is a common social media convention to indicate sarcasm or the opposite of what was just stated. additionally, the content (waking up every couple hours) is generally considered an unpleasant experience, which conflicts with calling it ""cool.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""is cool"") directly contradicts the true negative sentiment conveyed by the content and the ""#not"" tag. this stark contrast between the apparent meaning and the true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

"@Boeing, @SpaceX told to stop work under crew contracts #irony http://t.co/1Hyb70IATA",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""told to stop work"" suggests a setback or interruption, which is generally not positive. however, there are no strong emotional words or phrases that clearly indicate a strong sentiment one way or the other.

step 2: true intention
several elements suggest the true intention may be to point out irony:
- the hashtag ""#irony"" is explicitly included, indicating the author sees irony in the situation.
- boeing and spacex are major aerospace companies, and stopping work on crew contracts would be unexpected and potentially counterproductive.
- the inclusion of a link suggests there's more context to the story that might explain the ironic situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is fairly neutral, the explicit use of ""#irony"" suggests the author is highlighting a contradictory or unexpected situation. the contrast between what we might expect (progress on space crew contracts) and what's reported (stopping work) creates the ironic situation.

the use of irony is often associated with sarcasm, as both involve saying one thing while meaning another. however, not all irony is sarcastic. in this case, the tone seems more observational than biting or mocking, which are typical of sarcasm.

given the explicit labeling of irony by the author and the lack of clear sarcastic tone, i would classify this as:

- the second part expresses surprise and amusement with the astonished face and laughing emojis.
- the phrase ""i better get dressed then"" could be read as slightly exasperated, but the emojis suggest it's meant lightheartedly.

- they're humorously acknowledging that they're not fully prepared (not dressed yet).
- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is strongly negative. the phrase ""need to get out"" suggests urgency or desperation. the extreme statement ""before i kill my dad"" indicates intense frustration or anger.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely to express extreme frustration or annoyance with the speaker's father, probably due to being trapped in a car together for an extended period. the violent imagery (""kill my dad"") is almost certainly hyperbolic rather than literal, used for dramatic effect to convey the intensity of the speaker's feelings.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and true intention, there isn't a significant mismatch that would indicate sarcasm. the speaker appears to be genuinely expressing their frustration, albeit in an exaggerated manner. the hyperbole serves to emphasize the emotion rather than to convey the opposite of what's being said.

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""look good feel good!"" is inherently positive, suggesting a cheerful and motivational sentiment. this would typically indicate a non-sarcastic, positive statement.

several elements suggest the true intention may be different from the surface sentiment:
- the hashtag ""#not"" is often used to negate or contradict the preceding statement.
- ""#teamnosleep"" implies the person hasn't slept, which contradicts the idea of looking or feeling good.
- ""#cantopeneyes"" directly states a physical inability to open one's eyes, which is inconsistent with looking or feeling good.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""look good feel good!"") sharply contrasts with the implications of sleep deprivation and physical discomfort suggested by the hashtags. the use of ""#not"" explicitly signals that the opening statement should be interpreted oppositely. this mismatch between the initial positive statement and the contradictory hashtags, especially with the inclusion of ""#not"", strongly indicates sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is not immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears to be a straightforward question about the cost of building #mygov and #medicare
- the phrase ""i see this way too often..."" suggests some frustration or concern
- the inclusion of a link implies additional context is provided

step 2: true intention
- the question about cost seems rhetorical rather than genuinely seeking information
- ""i see this way too often..."" implies criticism or dissatisfaction with something recurring
- the link likely shows an error or malfunction in the #mygov or #medicare systems
- the true intention appears to be criticizing the functionality or reliability of these government systems in relation to their cost

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface question about cost contrasts with the implied criticism
- the seemingly neutral question is actually setting up for the critique that follows
- the juxtaposition of asking about cost and then implying frequent issues suggests the speaker finds the system overpriced or ineffective
- this contrast between the surface meaning and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm

based on this analysis, i conclude that the tweet is sarcastic. the speaker is using a rhetorical question and implication to sarcastically criticize the government systems mentioned.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and nostalgic. keywords like ""sad moment"" and phrases like ""past the point"" suggest disappointment. the desire to ""move back in"" implies longing for a past situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing genuine nostalgia and a bittersweet realization about growing up. the speaker is likely an adult reminiscing about childhood christmases when there were many presents under the tree. the statement ""i wanna move back in"" is probably not meant literally, but rather as an expression of wishing to return to a simpler, more magical time.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement seems to be a sincere expression of nostalgia and slight melancholy about the passage of time and loss of childhood wonder. there are no obvious indicators of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""may have had"" suggests uncertainty or downplaying
- ""few"" is in quotation marks, implying it might not be literal
- recycling emojis (♻♻) indicate environmentally conscious behavior
- hashtag #craftbeer suggests enthusiasm for craft beer

the surface sentiment seems positive or neutral, with a hint of understatement.

step 2: true intention
- the quotation marks around ""few"" likely indicate irony - implying there were actually many empties
- the phrase ""may have had"" is probably a humorous understatement
- the image link (http://t.co/qlzbtacmox) likely shows a large number of empty bottles
- the author is probably humorously admitting to drinking a lot of craft beer

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a discrepancy between the surface meaning (""few"" empties) and the likely true situation (many empties)
- the use of quotation marks and understatement creates a humorous effect
- the author is using self-deprecating humor about their beer consumption
- this fits the pattern of light sarcasm or irony

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is using sarcasm to humorously admit to drinking a lot of craft beer.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:

- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the tweet mentions ""#irony"" which suggests a contradictory or unexpected situation. there are no overtly positive or negative words or phrases, but the mention of ferguson, mo (which was associated with racial tensions and protests) could imply a negative context.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out a contradiction or unexpected political alignment. the tweet is highlighting that despite a certain expectation (implied but not stated), the mayor and governor of ferguson, mo are democrats. the use of ""yet"" at the beginning of the sentence emphasizes this contrast.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface appears mostly neutral, the true intention is to highlight a perceived irony or contradiction. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals the sarcastic nature of the comment. the tweet is using understatement and implied context to make a point about political expectations versus reality.

Steps:

- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis

- use of ""abnormal"" to describe the professor could be seen as negative
- hashtags #irony and #psychhumor suggest a humorous or ironic interpretation

step 2: true intention

- juxtaposition of a professor carrying exam papers in a medication bag
- the hashtags reinforce that this is meant to be a joke about mental health in academia

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface description seems straightforward, but the use of ""abnormal"" and the zoloft bag create a humorous contradiction

Steps:

the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the context requires careful consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is extremely negative. the text lists a series of very negative traits and actions: ""thief"", ""liar"", ""vote rigger"", ""mocks those who use food banks"", and ""online bully"". the use of hashtag #irony at the end suggests some contradiction or unexpected element.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be calling out hypocrisy or contradiction. the list of negative traits appears to be describing someone (likely a public figure) who the speaker believes embodies these negative qualities. the use of #irony suggests that this person's actions or status contradict their behavior in some way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (extremely negative description) aligns with the true intention of criticizing someone. however, the use of #irony indicates that there's an element of sarcasm or ironic observation here. it's likely that the person being described holds a position or claims values that directly contradict the negative traits listed.

given this analysis, i would classify this as:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of confusion and surprise. the phrase ""what the hell has happened"" indicates bewilderment. the tweet points out unusual behaviors for shahid afridi: leaving more bouncers than playing and getting a review right. the tone seems questioning and slightly critical.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing surprise and perhaps amusement at afridi's uncharacteristic behavior. by highlighting these atypical actions, the author seems to be implying that afridi is acting out of character, which is unusual and noteworthy. the mention of getting a review right suggests that this is not typical for afridi, implying a history of poor reviews.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment expresses confusion, the true intention seems to be a mix of surprise and light mockery. the author is using rhetorical questions and exaggeration (""what the hell"") to emphasize the unusualness of afridi's recent performance. this contrast between the seemingly straightforward question and the implication of afridi's typical behavior suggests a sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is using sarcasm to comment on afridi's unexpected performance.

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""losing brain cells"" indicates a frustrating or unpleasant experience. the hashtags #irony and #moveitalong also suggest dissatisfaction with the current situation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is indeed to express frustration and boredom with the substitute teacher's class. the use of hyperbole (""losing brain cells"") and the hashtag #irony indicate that the speaker is employing sarcasm to emphasize how slow and unengaging the class feels.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention, but the use of exaggeration and the explicit mention of irony in the hashtag clearly indicate sarcastic expression. the speaker is not literally losing brain cells but is using this hyperbole to sarcastically comment on how dull and seemingly unproductive the class is.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""great,"" ""biggest,"" ""brightest""
- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- no clear positive or negative sentiment words
- use of ""#irony"" hashtag suggests awareness of a contradiction
- neutral tone in describing someone's username and their action

step 2: true intention
- the author is pointing out a perceived contradiction between the user's name (hayek and hockey) and their accusation of racism
- the use of ""yeah"" at the beginning suggests agreement, but the rest of the tweet contradicts this
- the ""#irony"" hashtag explicitly calls out the author's belief that there's an ironic situation

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface neutrality contrasts with the implied criticism of the user @hayekandhockey
- the author is using the irony hashtag to highlight what they see as hypocrisy or lack of self-awareness in the other user's behavior
- the tweet is constructed to point out a contradiction without directly stating it, relying on the reader to understand the implication

based on this analysis, i can confidently say:

### label: sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""but of course it was"" initially appears to agree with a previous statement
- the second sentence presents a hypothetical scenario that seems extreme and unlikely

step 2: true intention
- the ""but of course it was"" is likely not genuine agreement, but rather a sarcastic response
- the extreme hypothetical scenario is used to highlight perceived injustice and lack of care for black individuals by law enforcement
- the tone is bitter and cynical, using exaggeration to make a point about systemic racism

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement in the first part contrasts sharply with the harsh criticism implied by the hypothetical scenario
- the exaggerated example is used to convey frustration and criticism, not as a literal belief
- the overall message is one of criticism and disbelief, masked by seemingly agreeable language

given this analysis, the true intention is clearly at odds with the surface sentiment, using exaggeration and false agreement to convey a critical message.

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

2. the use of the word ""love"" for a typically negative experience is a classic sarcastic technique.

3. the explicit hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the statement leaves no doubt about the author's intention to be sarcastic.

- use of profanity (""fucking cunt"", repeated ""cunt"")
- hashtags like ""#not #pissed #off #nope"" seem to contradict the angry tone
- phrase ""how cute is that"" contrasts with the aggressive language

- the speaker is likely referring to someone they're very upset with
- the contrasting ""cute"" comment and contradictory hashtags suggest sarcasm
- the speaker is likely not actually calm or ""not pissed off"" as the hashtags claim

- the use of ""how cute is that"" is likely meant sarcastically given the context
- the hashtags appear to be used ironically to emphasize the opposite of what they state
- the overall message seems to be conveying anger through sarcasm

The song was 'don't cry for me Argentina' #irony,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. the text simply states a fact about a song title ""don't cry for me argentina"". there are no obvious sentimental keywords or phrases. the hashtag #irony is included, which hints at a potential deeper meaning.

step 2: true intention
the inclusion of the #irony hashtag suggests that there's more to this statement than just naming a song. it's likely that the context or situation in which this song was played or mentioned is contrary to its title or message. for example, the song might have been played in a situation where crying or sadness was actually appropriate or expected.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface-level statement (which is just factual) and the implied meaning suggested by the #irony hashtag. this discrepancy, along with the explicit labeling of irony by the user, strongly indicates that this is a sarcastic or ironic statement. the user is likely pointing out a contradictory or unexpected situation related to the song's title or message.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step, as the message contains some complexity that requires careful analysis.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of curiosity and questioning, with the phrase ""i wonder..."" however, the specific questions being asked imply negative stereotypes about people who use food banks. the hashtags #freedomofspeech and #foodbanks seem to be attempting to frame this as a legitimate topic of discussion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this message is likely not genuine curiosity, but rather to express a prejudiced view against people who use food banks. the question implies that many food bank users are irresponsible with money (buying ""huge tvs"") or have substance abuse issues (""are drunks""). the use of #freedomofspeech suggests the author is aware that this view may be controversial or offensive.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface curiosity (""i wonder..."") and the loaded nature of the questions being asked. the author is not genuinely seeking information, but rather expressing a negative opinion about food bank users under the guise of asking a question. the use of hashtags, particularly #freedomofspeech, further suggests that the author is being provocative intentionally.

given this analysis, the message appears to be using sarcasm to express a controversial opinion while maintaining plausible deniability. the seemingly innocent wondering is actually a vehicle for expressing prejudice.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. ""serious sh*t"" could be interpreted positively or negatively depending on context. the ""#not"" and ""ayoba"" (a south african slang term meaning ""cool"" or ""nice"") add complexity. the censoring of ""shit"" suggests some restraint or formality.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems negative towards long-distance relationships. the use of ""serious sh*t"" in this context likely means ""difficult"" or ""problematic."" the ""#not"" before ""ayoba"" is crucial, as it negates the positive meaning of ""ayoba,"" emphasizing that long-distance relationships are not cool or nice.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a discrepancy between the potential positive interpretation of ""serious sh*t"" (which could mean important or significant in some contexts) and the clearly negative intention revealed by ""#not ayoba."" this contrast, along with the informal language and use of a hashtag to deliver the punchline, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""@outsilver87 @lasvegascapper ya, because if history has told us anything, it's that betting on sports is a great way to make money!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""ya"" (informal ""yes"") and ""great"" in all caps suggests strong agreement and enthusiasm.
- the phrase ""betting on sports is a great way to make money"" appears to be a positive statement about sports betting.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if history has told us anything"" is often used to introduce a contradictory statement.
- the exaggerated use of ""great"" in all caps hints at overstatement.
- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overly positive about sports betting.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

step 2: true intention

- overall surface sentiment appears negative or complaining.

step 2: true intention
- this could be a straightforward complaint about being overworked.
- however, the informal tone and exaggerated phrasing (""so hard"") could potentially indicate hyperbole or sarcasm.
- without more context, it's difficult to determine if the speaker is genuinely complaining or making a joke about a relatively easy workday.

- the tone seems friendly and lighthearted, indicated by the use of ""hey"" and the smiley face "":)"" at the end.
- the mention of ""geeky/nerdy followers"" is not inherently negative, but could be seen as playful.
- the use of ""#sarcasm marker"" suggests awareness of sarcasm as a concept.
- overall, the surface sentiment appears positive and casual.

step 2: true intention

- the phrase ""they'll start doing exactly the same"" suggests a humorous exaggeration of how literally some people might take posts.
- the true intention seems to be a playful critique of online communication challenges, particularly among a certain demographic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention in its lighthearted tone.
- however, the tweet itself is using a form of gentle sarcasm to make its point.
- the exaggeration about followers ""doing exactly the same"" is a sarcastic device.

- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm
- the tweet likely means the joke was actually terrible or inappropriate, not genuinely good

- there are no emojis or strong emotional indicators

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be responding to someone using plural self-reference (""we"" instead of ""i"")
- the phrase ""you'll get that"" implies some consequence or reaction
- the multiple @ mentions suggest this is part of a larger conversation
- the content seems to be critiquing or commenting on the use of plural self-reference

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral, but the true intention seems to be mildly critical
- there's a subtle implication that using plural self-reference will lead to some negative outcome or reaction
- the phrasing ""you'll get that"" could be interpreted as a dry or sarcastic way of saying ""you'll face consequences"" or ""you'll be perceived negatively""
- while not overtly sarcastic, there's a hint of irony or mockery in pointing out this linguistic behavior

after careful consideration, i believe this tweet has a subtle sarcastic tone. the seemingly neutral statement masks a criticism of plural self-reference, using understatement for effect.

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. phrases like ""gotta love"" and ""sets the festive mood"" suggest enthusiasm and appreciation for the musical performance. the description of ""jingle bells"" also evokes a festive atmosphere.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, several elements suggest a different intention:
1. ""romanian playing an improvised version"" implies an unexpected or unconventional performance.
2. ""in a minor key"" contrasts with the typically cheerful nature of jingle bells.
3. ""really sets the festive mood"" likely means the opposite, given the minor key.
4. the ""#not"" hashtag at the end is a clear indicator that the previous statements are meant sarcastically.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment sharply contrasts with the true intention. the author is using positive language to describe something that is likely perceived as unpleasant or unfestive. the ""#not"" hashtag confirms that the entire statement is meant sarcastically, negating the apparent positive sentiment.

Perfect time to get sick 😢 #not,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing frustration or disappointment about getting sick at an inconvenient time. the use of ""perfect time"" is clearly ironic, as no time is actually perfect to get sick. the crying emoji reinforces the genuine negative feelings about the situation. the ""#not"" hashtag is a common way to explicitly signal sarcasm or irony in social media posts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the initial positive phrase ""perfect time"" and the rest of the content, which expresses negative sentiment. this contrast, combined with the explicit use of ""#not"", strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to emphasize how bad the timing of their illness is.

- the explicit mention of irony in the tweet itself is a strong indicator of sarcastic intent
- the dramatic decrease in ""faith in humanity"" over a misunderstood tweet is likely hyperbole used for sarcastic effect

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""you've set yourself some target to achieve"" could be interpreted as encouraging. the hashtags ""#hot or #not"" don't convey a clear sentiment on their own.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is ambiguous and difficult to determine without more context. the phrase ""you've set yourself some target to achieve there"" could be genuine encouragement, or it could be sarcastic, implying the target is trivial or unimpressive. the ""#hot or #not"" hashtag suggests the tweet may be referencing a superficial rating system, which could be seen as a critique of such systems.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's not enough clear contrast between the surface sentiment and potential true intention to confidently label this as sarcastic. while there's a possibility of sarcasm in the phrasing, it's equally possible that the tweet is a straightforward comment about someone setting a goal related to attractiveness or popularity.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i would err on the side of caution.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as there are some complexities to consider:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part ""change is a process, #not an event"" seems like a straightforward, somewhat motivational statement
- the use of ""||"" and hashtag ""#not"" adds emphasis
- ""dafuq you thinking"" is a colloquial, somewhat aggressive phrase expressing confusion or disagreement

step 2: true intention
- the first part appears to be quoting or referencing a common saying about change
- the abrupt shift to ""dafuq you thinking"" creates a jarring contrast
- this contrast suggests the speaker is mocking or criticizing the initial statement
- the informal, aggressive tone implies frustration or derision towards whoever might believe the initial statement

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of the first part is neutral or positive, while the second part is negative and confrontational
- this stark contrast between the two parts is a common structure in sarcastic statements
- the speaker appears to be using the initial quote to set up an expectation, then subverting it with the crude response
- this structure and the mocking tone strongly suggest sarcastic intent

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- ""yay!"" exclamation, typically expressing joy or excitement
- multiple exclamation marks after ""again!!!"" suggesting enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears negative:
- getting a cold is generally an unpleasant experience
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates sarcastic intent
- the hashtag ""#notexcitedaboutthisshitatall"" clearly expresses negative feelings

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface positivity (""yay!"") and the true negative sentiment. the use of ""#sarcasm"" confirms the sarcastic intent. the contrast between the enthusiastic exclamations and the actual undesirable situation of getting sick is a classic sarcastic structure.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the hashtag ""#funny"" suggests a humorous or light-hearted tone
- ""#18+"" indicates adult content
- ""turn on"" could be interpreted as positive or suggestive
- ""#not all men"" is a phrase often used in serious discussions about gender issues
- the presence of a link suggests shared content, possibly an image

step 2: true intention
- the combination of ""#funny"" and ""#18+"" with ""turn on"" implies the content is likely meant to be humorous and adult-oriented
- ""aquabreeze"" and ""disgustinghotels"" are unclear without context, but might be usernames or references
- ""#not all men"" is typically used seriously in gender discussions, but its placement here, especially after ""#funny"", suggests it might be used ironically or sarcastically
- the juxtaposition of ""turn on"" with ""disgustinghotels"" creates a contradictory image, potentially for humorous effect

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears light-hearted and humorous
- the true intention seems to be making a joke or sarcastic comment, likely about gender issues or relationships
- the use of ""#not all men"" in this context, especially following ""#funny"", strongly suggests it's being used sarcastically

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification because:

1. the statement ""a burned tongue is a lovely way to start the day"" is clearly sarcastic. no one would genuinely consider a burned tongue to be a pleasant experience.

2. the use of the word ""lovely"" to describe a painful experience (burned tongue) is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning.

3. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates that the tweet is meant to be understood as sarcastic.

4. the additional hashtag ""#ouch"" further reinforces that the experience is actually painful, not lovely.

given these clear indicators, this tweet can be confidently classified as sarcastic without needing to go through a step-by-step analysis.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""@outsilver87 @lasvegascapper ya, because if history has told us anything, it's that betting on sports is a great way to make money!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""ya"" (informal ""yes"") and ""great"" in all caps suggests strong agreement and enthusiasm.
- the phrase ""betting on sports is a great way to make money"" appears to be a positive statement about sports betting.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if history has told us anything"" is often used to introduce a contradictory statement.
- the exaggerated use of ""great"" in all caps hints at overstatement.
- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overly positive about sports betting.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative or uncomfortable. the use of ""#cringe"" explicitly indicates discomfort or embarrassment. the emoji choices (😲😬) further reinforce this sentiment, showing shock and awkwardness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment but adds a layer of humor or social commentary. the speaker is expressing genuine discomfort about an older person (a friend's dad) interacting with them on social media in a way that feels inappropriate or awkward. the casual language (""ya mates"") and the use of hashtag humor suggest the speaker is sharing this experience in a relatable, somewhat humorous way despite the actual discomfort.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the speaker is genuinely expressing discomfort, but doing so in a way that's meant to be relatable and slightly humorous to their audience. while there's an element of exaggeration in the use of ""#cringe"" and the emojis, this doesn't constitute sarcasm. instead, it's a common way of expressing genuine feelings on social media platforms.

Steps:

the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be pointing out irony in a situation involving anti-state people, hackers, and sony. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the author sees some contradiction. the phrase ""little man (hacker) won"" suggests a david vs. goliath narrative, while ""in reality the state won"" presents a contrasting view.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking those who believe that hackers triumphed over a large corporation (sony). the author is suggesting that despite appearances, the state (likely referring to government or authority) actually benefited from this situation. the use of ""anti state ppl"" implies skepticism towards those who oppose governmental authority.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a discrepancy between the surface-level mention of irony and the actual statement, which doesn't present a clear ironic situation. instead, the author is using ""#irony"" sarcastically to mock those who might view the hacker's actions as a victory against the establishment. the contrast between the perceived win of the ""little man"" and the actual win of ""the state"" is presented in a way that suggests the author finds the misperception amusing or worthy of ridicule.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is indeed sarcastic. the use of ""#irony"" in this context, along with the mocking tone towards those who might misinterpret the situation, strongly indicates sarcasm.

step 2: true intention

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface advice and the true intention. the tweet uses irony to criticize people who post smoking videos. the hashtags ""#socool"" and ""#not"" directly indicate sarcasm, with ""#not"" negating the supposed coolness.

the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly curious. the question ""has anyone visualised..."" suggests genuine inquiry. the phrase ""kinda lipmus test"" (likely meant to be ""litmus test"") implies a comparison or evaluation, but doesn't carry strong sentiment on its own.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a mix of genuine inquiry and a playful or creative analogy. the author is asking about data visualization of twitter streams, but then compares it to a ""litmus test,"" which is typically used to test acidity or alkalinity. this comparison of digital data to a chemical test creates an unusual juxtaposition.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's no strong contradiction between the surface sentiment and true intention, the unexpected comparison of twitter data to a litmus test introduces an element of humor or cleverness. this could be seen as a mild form of sarcasm or wit, but it's not overtly sarcastic in the traditional sense of saying one thing and meaning the opposite.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the ""#not"" at the end. this hashtag is commonly used to negate the previous statement, indicating that the walk did not actually do any good. the author is likely emphasizing how unwell they feel by sarcastically claiming that a difficult walk helped when it clearly didn't.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with phrases like ""snuggles up"" and ""giddy glee"" suggesting warmth and excitement. these words typically convey affection and happiness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out inconsistent or hypocritical behavior. the use of ""then later"" implies a contrast with previous actions. the hashtag ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author is highlighting a contradictory situation. the capitalization of ""the royals"" suggests they're being singled out as significant in this context.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the implied criticism. the author is using cheerful language (""snuggles up"", ""giddy glee"") to mock what they perceive as insincere or contradictory behavior. the explicit use of ""#irony"" further confirms that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the use of exaggeratedly positive language to describe behavior the author clearly finds hypocritical, combined with the explicit labeling of irony, makes this a clear case of sarcasm.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- describing pleasant weather conditions (""blue skies, warm air"")
- mentioning ""royal accommodation"" which implies luxury
- the hashtag ""#whatmoredoesoneneed"" suggesting contentment
- use of exclamation marks indicating enthusiasm

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism or frustration, indicated by:
- the hashtag ""#education?"" followed by ""#not..."" implies that education is missing or lacking
- the contrast between luxurious conditions and the implied lack of education
- the ellipsis after ""#not"" suggests an omitted negative statement

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the positive surface sentiment and the implied criticism. the tweet starts by painting an idyllic picture but then uses hashtags to subtly criticize the situation, likely pointing out that comfortable conditions are prioritized over education. this use of contrast and implied criticism strongly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""great,"" ""biggest,"" ""brightest""
- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet mentions international human rights day, which is typically a positive observance.
- there are no overtly positive or negative words.
- the hashtag #irony is used, which immediately suggests a disconnect between the surface meaning and the true intention.

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""#irony"" implies that the author sees something contradictory or inconsistent about international human rights day.
- this suggests that the author may believe human rights are not being respected or upheld, despite the existence of this international day.
- the brevity of the tweet, with no additional context or celebration, further hints at skepticism or criticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface-level mention of international human rights day seems neutral or potentially positive.
- however, the addition of ""#irony"" completely changes the meaning, indicating that the author finds the concept of this day to be at odds with reality.
- the contrast between the seemingly straightforward mention of the day and the implication of irony creates a sarcastic tone.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or excited. the use of capital letters in ""both"" suggests emphasis or enthusiasm. the hashtag ""#everythingisfine"" also seems to convey a positive mood on the surface.

step 2: true intention
despite the seemingly positive surface, there are clear indicators of sarcasm:
1. the timing (""just one week before i'm going there"") implies the author is frustrated about missing the chance to see these celebrities.
2. the hashtag ""#everythingisfine"" is often used sarcastically to express that things are actually not fine.
3. the additional hashtags ""#not"" and ""#sonot"" explicitly negate the previous statement, confirming that everything is not, in fact, fine.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (excitement, positivity) sharply contrasts with the true intention (frustration, disappointment). the use of ""#everythingisfine"" followed immediately by ""#not"" and ""#sonot"" creates a clear sarcastic tone, where the author says one thing but means the opposite.

- the winking emoticon ""; )"" suggests a playful or teasing tone
- there are no overtly negative or sarcastic keywords

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""i take it"" implies the speaker is making an inference
- the mention of ""not in england"" suggests there's some context about england's current situation (possibly weather-related) that isn't explicitly stated
- the winking emoticon reinforces that there's an implied meaning beyond the surface level

- the winking emoticon is a key indicator that there's more to the message than its literal meaning
- however, this doesn't necessarily make it sarcastic - it's more of a gentle tease or humorous observation

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

- ""surrealist estate agency"" is an unusual and potentially humorous combination of words
- the exclamation marks (!!) add enthusiasm to the statement
- overall, the surface sentiment appears positive and excited

step 2: true intention
- ""surrealist estate agency"" is an oxymoron, as real estate agencies typically deal with concrete, practical matters, not surrealism
- the inclusion of a link suggests the tweet is likely referencing some unusual or absurd real estate listing or situation
- the unusual pairing and exclamation marks may indicate the author is poking fun at or expressing disbelief about something related to real estate

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the welcoming surface sentiment and the likely critical or humorous true intention
- the use of ""surrealist"" in this context is likely meant to highlight something absurd or unbelievable
- the enthusiastic punctuation is probably meant to emphasize the absurdity rather than express genuine excitement

- the use of ""fucking"" as an expletive indicates strong negative emotion
- ""gave up"" suggests frustration or disappointment
- ""#not-happy"" directly states a negative sentiment
- overall surface sentiment is clearly negative

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is expressing genuine frustration about their car breaking down
- the language is direct and emotional, matching the apparent sentiment
- hashtags reinforce the literal meaning rather than subverting it
- there's no indication of exaggeration or irony that would suggest sarcasm

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns closely with the true intention
- the strong language and hashtags emphasize sincere negative emotions
- there's no discrepancy between what is said and what is meant
- the tweet lacks any indicators of sarcasm such as hyperbole or mocking tone

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

label: not sarcastic

the tweet expresses genuine frustration about a car breakdown without any sarcastic elements.",0.0
I like the feeling when people thinks they're 2 steps ahead of me... But the truth is they're miles and miles behind me AHAHAHAHA |#sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the use of ""chu***"" (likely a censored hindi profanity) and the hashtag ""#irony"" suggest a critical or frustrated tone.

step 2: true intention
the tweet seems to be commenting on language attitudes in india. it implies that when a marathi-speaking person speaks hindi, they are considered or treated as ""chu***"" (likely meaning ""idiots"" or something similarly derogatory). the use of ""#irony"" suggests that the speaker finds this situation paradoxical or unfair.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface negativity aligns with the true intention of criticizing a perceived linguistic prejudice. however, the use of ""#irony"" indicates that the speaker is highlighting the absurdity of the situation rather than simply complaining. this suggests a sarcastic tone, using irony to point out the contradictory nature of expecting hindi from marathi speakers while simultaneously looking down on them for speaking it.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""lesson learnt?"" suggests a teachable moment or moral to the story.
- the use of ""herd of sheep"" to describe people is derogatory.
- hashtags like #irony and #capitalism indicate criticism of consumer behavior.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is mocking people who frantically bought tvs during black friday sales.
- it's implying these people acted foolishly, like sheep in a herd, without thinking.
- the irony is that now these same people are having trouble reselling the tvs they fought over.
- the author is criticizing both the consumerist frenzy of black friday and the short-sightedness of those who participated.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface question ""lesson learnt?"" is not genuinely asking if people learned something.
- instead, it's rhetorically pointing out the foolishness of the behavior.
- the use of ""herd of sheep"" and hashtags like #irony clearly indicate the author's critical stance.
- the contrast between the initial frenzy to buy and the subsequent struggle to sell highlights the sarcastic tone.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

- the use of hashtags ""#school"" and ""#sarcasm"" is neutral in tone

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems negative or frustrated:
- ""tomorrow three test signature"" implies multiple tests coming up, which is typically stressful for students
- the abrupt, choppy structure of the sentence suggests tension or frustration
- the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" hashtag directly indicates the speaker's sarcastic intent

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface politeness (""thank you"") and the underlying stress of having multiple tests. the addition of the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag confirms that the speaker is not genuinely thankful for the tests. they are using sarcasm to express their displeasure or stress about the upcoming tests.

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention

- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze

- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm

- the use of hashtags like ""#not #responsible"" and ""#discounts"" seems to highlight complaints.
- the overall tone appears to be one of frustration and disappointment.

step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to be expressing extreme dissatisfaction with a company's customer service.
- the mention of ""$10 #discounts"" in the context of poor service suggests the speaker finds this inadequate or insulting.
- the use of ""they say"" implies the speaker is quoting or paraphrasing the company's response, which they clearly disagree with.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment is negative, the true intention seems to amplify this negativity through sarcasm.
- the phrase ""they say #not #responsible"" likely doesn't mean the company literally said this, but rather the speaker is sarcastically implying this is the company's attitude.
- the mention of a $10 discount for ""the worst #customerservice"" is likely an exaggeration to emphasize how inadequate the company's response has been.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part is neutral, stating a fact about auntie calling.
- the second part expresses surprise and amusement with the astonished face and laughing emojis.
- the phrase ""i better get dressed then"" could be read as slightly exasperated, but the emojis suggest it's meant lightheartedly.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is genuinely informing about their aunt's imminent arrival.
- they're humorously acknowledging that they're not fully prepared (not dressed yet).
- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 3: comparison and analysis

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""we may be some time"" suggests a neutral or slightly negative sentiment, implying a long wait or delay.
- the hashtag ""#hibernot"" is a play on words combining ""hibernate"" and ""not,"" which could indicate a positive or energetic sentiment.
- the ""#not"" hashtag could be interpreted as negating the previous statement.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""we may be some time"" is likely a reference to captain oates' famous last words before his death in antarctica, typically used to indicate a long absence or difficult task.
- ""#hibernot"" suggests the opposite of hibernating, implying activity or adventure during a time typically associated with inactivity.
- the combination of these elements suggests the speaker is playfully indicating they're going on an adventure or outdoor activity, rather than staying inside or ""hibernating.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a contrast between the surface meaning of ""we may be some time"" (suggesting delay or absence) and the implied meaning of going on an adventure.
- the use of ""#hibernot"" further supports the idea of outdoor activity rather than staying in.
- the ""#not"" could be reinforcing the idea that they're not actually going to be gone for an extremely long time, or it could be negating the idea of hibernating.

given this analysis, while there's a slight mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. instead, it seems to be a playful way of announcing an outdoor activity or adventure.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the intended meaning isn't immediately clear to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears to be reporting news about the ndp (new democratic party) introducing a bill
- the hashtags ""#not appropriate"" and ""#confidentiality"" suggest concern or criticism
- the surface sentiment seems negative or critical towards the reported action

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is from @torontostar, which is likely a news outlet reporting on political developments
- ohip stands for ontario health insurance plan, which is already a public healthcare system
- it's unclear why making a public system ""public"" would be inappropriate or a confidentiality issue
- the combination of the news and the contradictory hashtags suggests the tweet might be pointing out an inconsistency or absurdity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the reported action (making ohip public) and the critical hashtags
- this mismatch creates an absurd or nonsensical situation
- the use of hashtags that contradict the nature of ohip suggests the tweet is likely mocking or criticizing the reported bill or the way it's being presented
- the incongruity between the surface sentiment and the logical analysis of the content points towards sarcasm

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is using sarcasm to comment on the political situation or media reporting.

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is mixed and complex. there are contrasting emotions expressed:
- positive: smiles, recognition
- negative: scowls, ignorance
the emojis also present a mix of concepts:
- positive: 😊 (church), 💰 (money bag)
- negative: 👊💥 (punch), 💔 (broken heart)
overall, there's a stark contrast between reactions to money and not (presumably lack of money).

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be a critique of how people and institutions behave differently based on the presence or absence of money. the structure ""x when there is money | y when there is not"" is repeated, emphasizing this contrast. the emojis at the end seem to represent various institutions (church, bank, hospital) followed by money, police, and violence, suggesting a cynical view of how these systems operate. the final line with broken hearts around ""god"" and ""$"" implies a criticism of the relationship between religion and money.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment presents contrasting reactions, the true intention is to highlight and criticize these contrasts sarcastically. the exaggerated nature of the reactions (smiles vs. scowls, recognition vs. ignorance) and the repetitive structure are typical of sarcastic expressions. the use of hashtags and emojis in an unconventional way further supports a sarcastic reading, as it's using a playful format to deliver a serious critique.

the surface positive sentiment (""gotta love"") directly contradicts the negative experience of being lied to. the addition of ""#not"" confirms that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their frustration or disappointment about being lied to.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm is subtle here:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears polite and factual, stating ""ladies wouldn't use that language.""
- there's a contrast introduced with ""but i guess you are not one.""
- no overtly positive or negative emotional words or emojis are used.

step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to be an insult or criticism disguised as a polite observation.
- by stating ""ladies wouldn't use that language"" and then implying the person addressed is not a lady, the speaker is essentially calling them unladylike or crude.
- the phrase ""but i guess"" introduces a false sense of uncertainty when the speaker is actually making a pointed judgment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the polite surface of the first statement contrasts sharply with the implied insult in the second part.
- the use of ""i guess"" is likely not genuine uncertainty but a sarcastic device to soften the delivery of the insult.
- the overall message is delivered in a way that maintains a veneer of civility while actually conveying criticism.

based on this analysis, the statement uses sarcasm to deliver an insult indirectly.

        ","let me think this through step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the phrase ""i hate you"". however, this is immediately followed by ""lol"" (laugh out loud), which introduces a contradictory light-hearted tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be playful or affectionate rather than genuinely hateful. the use of ""lol"" suggests that the speaker is joking. in casual online communication, phrases like ""i hate you lol"" are often used ironically between friends to express fondness or mild annoyance in a humorous way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface sentiment (""i hate you"") and the true intention (likely affection or playful annoyance). this mismatch, combined with the use of ""lol"" to signal humor, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- the link probably shows an image of the short hair being referred to.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

step 2: true intention

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

- without knowing what the link leads to, it's impossible to determine if there's a mismatch between the stated desire to post and the actual content being shared.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the absence of crucial context (especially the content of the linked image/video), i cannot confidently determine whether this tweet is sarcastic or not.

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is mixed:
- ""#lol"" suggests amusement
- ""#wtf"" indicates confusion or frustration
- ""great commercial"" appears positive
- ""#sarcasm"" explicitly states sarcasm

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be critical or mocking:
- ""#birthcontrol"" and ""#whatisbirthcontrol"" coupled with ""@planb"" suggests the tweet is about a birth control commercial
- the use of ""#wtf"" implies disbelief or criticism of the commercial's content
- ""#sarcasm"" directly indicates that the phrase ""great commercial"" is not meant sincerely

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly positive ""great commercial"" and the surrounding context (confusion, criticism, explicit sarcasm tag) clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to express disapproval or mockery of the commercial.

the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the speaker states they are the school nurse for the day, which could be seen as a professional responsibility. there are no overtly positive or negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the second sentence: ""and i have a fever."" this reveals an ironic situation where the person responsible for health care is themselves ill. the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly points out this contradiction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the seemingly normal situation of being a school nurse and the ironic twist of the nurse being sick. the use of ""so"" at the beginning suggests a casual tone that downplays the absurdity of the situation. the explicit labeling of the situation as ironic with the hashtag further emphasizes the speaker's awareness of the contradiction and likely frustration or amusement with the situation.

- no positive words or emojis are present

- larry ellison is likely being criticized here
- the phrase ""world's worst human"" is a hyperbolic statement
- the exaggeration suggests this might not be meant literally

- however, the use of extreme exaggeration (""world's worst human"") is a common sarcastic technique
- the casual tone and hyperbole suggest this isn't meant to be taken literally

- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or annoyance with the task at hand. the use of ""now to..."" at the beginning suggests a sense of reluctance or resignation. the ellipsis (...) at the end, followed by a link, could indicate that the task is more complex or tedious than it might initially appear.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle discrepancy between the neutral surface sentiment and the underlying tone of frustration. the speaker is likely using understatement to convey their annoyance with having to perform this technical task. the casual tone (""now to..."") combined with the specific technical details and the trailing ellipsis suggest a mild form of sarcasm.

- the speaker is discussing player retention in sports (likely basketball given the mention of ""ft's"" which likely means free throws)
- they're expressing a genuine opinion about retaining a player at maximum cost
- the phrase ""selfishly speaking"" indicates honesty about their personal perspective
- they hope for a slightly depressed market for the player, which aligns with their desire to retain him

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention align well
- there's no apparent contradiction or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm
- the speaker is being straightforward about their hopes and analysis of the situation
- the admission of selfishness further supports the sincerity of the statement

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

the tweet explicitly uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is a clear indicator that the statement is meant sarcastically. additionally, the exaggerated expression of shock (""i'm shocked"") and the use of multiple exclamation marks suggest an over-the-top reaction that is likely not genuine. the context implies that mark may frequently criticizes the buckeyes, so the author is sarcastically expressing fake surprise at his expected negative opinion.",1.0
"Google scholarship application kept crashing in Chrome. Opened it in IE, finished application without incident. #irony",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative:
- ""kept crashing"" indicates a problem
- ""finished application without incident"" suggests a positive resolution

step 2: true intention
the true intention involves pointing out an ironic situation:
- google's product (chrome) failed to handle a google application
- internet explorer (ie), often considered inferior, succeeded where chrome failed
- the hashtag #irony explicitly calls out the ironic nature of the situation

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment doesn't fully capture the speaker's intention. the true intention is to highlight the irony of the situation, using a factual statement to convey a sense of amusement or frustration at the unexpected outcome. the use of the #irony hashtag confirms the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

given this analysis, i can confidently label this as sarcastic.

the surface sentiment appears negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""guess you could say i've got my life together"" initially sounds positive, but is immediately followed by ""#not"", which negates it. the use of ""sorry"" also suggests a negative or apologetic tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously point out a mistake (setting an alarm incorrectly) and mock oneself for it. the phrase ""i've got my life together"" is clearly meant ironically, emphasized by the ""#not"". the mention of ""mom and jesus"" at the end adds to the self-deprecating humor, implying the speaker needs divine intervention for such a simple task.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention, but the sarcasm comes from the exaggerated self-mockery and the ironic use of ""i've got my life together"". the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly signals the sarcastic nature of the statement. the overall tone is self-deprecating humor delivered through sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, several elements suggest a different intention:
1. the exaggerated language (""have you ever seen the like??"") is likely hyperbolic.
2. the juxtaposition of ""republican move"" with robbing the royal family is incongruous, as republicans typically aren't associated with british royalty.
3. the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the statement is not to be taken at face value.
4. the mention of a ""32k meal"" is likely an exaggeration to highlight perceived excess.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface shock and concern contrasts sharply with the true intention, which appears to be mocking both the idea of republicans affecting the royal family and the extravagance associated with royalty. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the phrase ""i just love"" which typically expresses strong positive feelings. however, this is immediately contradicted by the eye-roll emoji (😒) at the end, which expresses annoyance or frustration. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#needmeds"" also suggest a negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to express frustration and discomfort about waking up with a migraine. the phrase ""i just love"" is used ironically to emphasize how unpleasant the experience is. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly negates the positive statement, while ""#needmeds"" emphasizes the severity of the migraine.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface positive sentiment (""i just love"") and the true negative intention. this contradiction, combined with the use of irony and the explicit negation in ""#not,"" are strong indicators of sarcasm.

- the use of ""oh oh"" suggests concern or worry
- ""#not #pleased"" indicates negative sentiment
- the hashtag ""#littletike"" implies a child is involved, which could be endearing in other contexts
- overall, the surface sentiment seems negative or worried

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be describing a situation where a child (referred to as ""littletike"") has done something that will displease their mother
- the repetition of ""oh oh"" emphasizes the anticipation of a negative reaction
- the use of hashtags, especially for common words like ""not"" and ""going,"" suggests a playful or exaggerated tone
- the included link likely leads to an image showing what the child has done

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention – both convey concern about an impending negative reaction
- the use of hashtags and the lighthearted reference to ""littletike"" suggest the tweet is more playful than genuinely worried
- while there's an element of exaggeration, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic in the sense of saying one thing and meaning the opposite

        ","sarcastic

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the tweet is clearly sarcastic due to several factors:

1. the statement ""its a shame on an off day that the nfl doesnt have any interesting stories and isnt getting any attention"" is contrary to reality. the nfl typically generates significant attention and stories even on off days.

2. the use of ""not"" in all caps at the end of the tweet is a clear indicator of sarcasm, explicitly reversing the meaning of the preceding statement.

3. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is included, which directly labels the tweet as sarcastic.

these elements together make it unambiguous that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic, likely commenting on the fact that the nfl is actually dominating the news cycle even on an off day.",1.0

- the link probably shows an image of the short hair being referred to.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

step 1: surface sentiment
- ""felicitats"" is catalan for ""congratulations,"" which is positive.
- there's a link, likely to an image or article.
- two hashtags: #penedesfera (possibly referring to a region or community) and #notcies (likely a misspelling of ""notícies,"" meaning ""news"" in catalan).
- the surface sentiment appears positive due to the congratulatory word.

step 2: true intention
- the tweet seems to be genuinely congratulating someone or something.
- the link probably provides context for the congratulations.
- the hashtags suggest this is related to news in the penedès region of catalonia.
- there are no obvious indicators of irony or sarcasm in the language used.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (congratulations) aligns with the likely true intention.
- there's no apparent contradiction or irony between the congratulatory word and the hashtags or link.
- the tweet appears to be a straightforward congratulatory message related to some news in the penedès region.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

step 1: surface sentiment
- negative phrases: ""rudderless at the death"", ""progressively worse""
- positive phrase: ""can't wait""
- hashtag: #sarcasm (explicitly indicates sarcasm)

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""can't wait"" is likely not sincere given the negative context
- ""seven games and we've got progressively worse"" implies disappointment
- the hashtag #sarcasm clearly indicates the author's intention to be sarcastic

step 3: compare and analyze

- the phrase ""at least"" often indicates a positive or consoling tone
- ""you got my joke"" suggests that understanding occurred, which is usually positive
- overall, the surface sentiment appears mildly positive or neutral

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""at least"" can sometimes be a marker for sarcasm, implying a bare minimum was achieved
- without more context, it's unclear if the speaker is genuinely pleased that their joke was understood or if they're expressing frustration that only this person got it
- the brevity and casual tone of the tweet could be hiding underlying sarcasm

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's potential for a mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention
- the phrase ""at least"" is often used sarcastically to point out a small positive in an otherwise negative situation
- however, without more context about the original joke or the relationship between the users, it's difficult to definitively determine sarcasm

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

i'm confident in this classification for the following reasons:

1. the tweet uses a rhetorical question (""is there a 'like' tab on me?"") to set up the sarcastic tone.

2. it draws a comparison between the speaker and a facebook status, which is inherently absurd and meant to be humorous.

3. the phrase ""i'm not a facebook status to be liked by people"" directly states the contrast between reality and the implied expectation, which is a common structure in sarcastic statements.

4. most importantly, the tweet includes the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is an explicit indication that the speaker intends the message to be taken as sarcastic.

5. the additional hashtag ""#rudebuttrue"" further reinforces the sarcastic tone, implying that while the statement might seem rude, it's expressing a truth (in a sarcastic manner).

given these clear indicators, particularly the explicit use of the sarcasm hashtag, i'm very confident in classifying this tweet as sarcastic.",1.0

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing disappointment or criticism about johnny manziel (known as ""johnny football"") and his performance with the cleveland browns. the truncated link at the end likely leads to an article detailing a poor performance or negative news about manziel or the browns.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention. both convey a negative sentiment about johnny manziel's situation with the cleveland browns. the unusual hashtag formatting (#johnny #football #time) could be seen as emphasizing each word sarcastically, suggesting that what was once exciting (""johnny football time"") is now disappointing.

        ","given the nature of this tweet, i believe it's best to analyze it step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears neutral on the surface
- uses hashtags to highlight key terms: #analysis, #economic, #issues, #whip, #up, #israelis, #chocolate, #pudding, #election
- shares a link, suggesting informational content
- no overtly emotional language or sentiment indicators

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely sharing a news article about economic issues in israel
- the phrase ""chocolate pudding election"" seems unusual in the context of economic and political news
- this juxtaposition of serious topics (economic issues, election) with a trivial item (chocolate pudding) could be interpreted as a subtle form of commentary or criticism

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment is neutral, the inclusion of ""chocolate pudding"" in relation to serious economic and political matters could be seen as a form of subtle sarcasm or irony
- however, without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is intentional sarcasm or simply an unusual news headline
- the tweet appears to be primarily sharing information rather than making a clear sarcastic statement

given the ambiguity and the lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i would lean towards classifying this as:

label: not sarcastic

the tweet seems to be sharing a news article with an unusual headline rather than making an overtly sarcastic comment. however, this classification is made with less than 100% certainty due to the potential for subtle irony in the juxtaposition of topics.",0.0

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or at least optimistic. the phrase ""better than"" suggests a favorable comparison, implying that three minutes is seen as a good thing compared to the alternative of no minutes.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is less clear-cut. while the statement is factually true (three minutes is indeed more than zero minutes), it could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context:
1. it could be a genuine attempt at positivity, encouraging someone to appreciate even a small amount of time.
2. alternatively, it could be a sarcastic comment implying that three minutes is an insignificant amount of time and barely worth mentioning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
without more context, it's difficult to definitively determine if this is sarcastic. however, the brevity of the statement and the fact that it's pointing out something so obvious (that 3 is more than 0) leans slightly towards a sarcastic interpretation. the use of twitter (@sr_duncan) also suggests this could be a quick, witty response to something, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm on social media.

given this analysis, i'm leaning towards a sarcastic interpretation, but with some uncertainty.

### Example:
Input: ""@outsilver87 @lasvegascapper ya, because if history has told us anything, it's that betting on sports is a great way to make money!""

Steps:

- the use of ""ya"" (informal ""yes"") and ""great"" in all caps suggests strong agreement and enthusiasm.
- the phrase ""betting on sports is a great way to make money"" appears to be a positive statement about sports betting.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if history has told us anything"" is often used to introduce a contradictory statement.
- the exaggerated use of ""great"" in all caps hints at overstatement.
- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overly positive about sports betting.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

- ""found my motivation"" sounds positive
- ""winners"" is typically a positive term
- the use of ""boy"" as an exclamation could indicate excitement

step 2: true intention
- ""aka the back of my eye lids"" implies sleeping or being lazy
- hashtags ""#not"" and ""#losers"" directly contradict the positive surface sentiment
- ""#senioritisisreal"" suggests a lack of motivation due to being a senior (in school)

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment presents finding motivation and being ""winners,"" but the true intention reveals the opposite. the author is actually talking about lacking motivation, sleeping, and feeling like a ""loser."" the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning, along with the use of contradictory hashtags, strongly indicates sarcasm.

- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

i'm confident in this classification without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the tweet explicitly includes the hashtag #sarcasm, which is a clear indicator of sarcastic intent.

2. the question ""how many people did we kill?"" in reference to a campaign is clearly not meant to be taken literally, especially in the context of discussing an online movement like gamergate.

3. the juxtaposition of gamergate with ebola (a serious disease) in a campaign context is absurd, further supporting the sarcastic tone.

4. the use of ""ah"" at the beginning sets a tone of mock nostalgia or false fondness, which is often used in sarcastic statements.

these elements combined make it very clear that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic, mocking the idea of gamergate having real-world deadly consequences.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. the quote ""peace on earth"" and the religious references (""lord, thy kingdom come, thy will be done"") suggest a positive, hopeful tone. however, the hashtags #terror and #irony introduce a negative and skeptical element.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disillusionment. the question ""where is the promise of 'peace on earth' in this?"" implies that the author sees a contradiction between the ideal of peace and some current event (likely related to terror, given the hashtag). the religious quote is used not in a straightforward faithful manner, but rather to highlight the perceived gap between religious ideals and reality. the use of #irony explicitly signals that the author sees a contradiction or incongruity in the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface-level positive religious sentiments and the underlying critical, skeptical tone. the author is using the juxtaposition of peaceful religious ideals against a presumably violent or terrifying reality to make a point. the explicit use of #irony, combined with this contrast, strongly suggests that the tweet is meant to be read sarcastically.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears negative due to the accusation of violence.
- the phrase ""you are violent"" is a direct and strong statement.
- the mention that it ""shows in your tweets"" suggests evidence for the accusation.

step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to be a direct criticism or confrontation.
- the use of all-caps ""you"" adds emphasis and could indicate frustration or anger.
- tagging multiple users suggests an attempt to call out or expose the accused person's behavior to others.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention.
- there's no indication of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
- the statement appears to be a straightforward accusation without any humorous or mocking undertones.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

Gael 'pro at presentations' Anderson #not #choke,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. ""pro at presentations"" suggests gael anderson is skilled at giving presentations. this seems like praise or a compliment.

step 2: true intention
however, several elements suggest a different true intention:
1. the use of quotation marks around 'pro at presentations' hints at irony or doubt about this claim.
2. the hashtag ""#not"" is a common way to negate the previous statement in social media language.
3. the hashtag ""#choke"" implies failure or poor performance, which directly contradicts being a ""pro"".

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment of praising gael's presentation skills sharply contrasts with the true intention. the hashtags and quotation marks work together to completely reverse the meaning, implying that gael is actually terrible at presentations and likely to choke or fail.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly meant to convey the opposite of what it literally says.

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

- ""relentless sound of am commuter traffic"" contrasts sharply with the idea of nature
- ""#fthunter"" could be read as ""f*** the hunter,"" expressing frustration
- ""#not@allpeaceful"" directly contradicts the initial positive sentiment

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the seemingly positive opening about nature and the reality of noisy traffic. the use of hashtags, especially ""#not@allpeaceful,"" further emphasizes this contradiction. the tweet is using irony to highlight the disconnect between the expectation of a peaceful natural experience and the reality of urban noise pollution.

step 2: true intention

3. the french word ""#frère"" (meaning ""brother"") adds an element of playfulness or inside joke.

- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance. the phrase ""well this is great.."" suggests something positive or beneficial has occurred. 

step 2: true intention
several factors indicate the true intention is negative:
1. the use of "".."" after ""great"" suggests hesitation or doubt.
2. the explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag directly states the comment is sarcastic.
3. the content of the news (making it illegal to record police) is generally seen as negative, restricting transparency and accountability.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""great"") sharply contrasts with the true negative sentiment about the law. this mismatch, combined with the explicit sarcasm tag, clearly indicates sarcasm.

- the combination of expressing difficulty and then saying ""good luck"" to oneself or another person often indicates a sarcastic tone
- the use of ""..."" adds to the sense that the speaker doesn't really believe it will be easy to remember the book

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm

i'm quite confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""so glad i came to work""
- exclamation marks suggest enthusiasm
- use of ""all the customers"" implies busyness

step 2: true intention
- the hashtag ""#not"" directly contradicts the positive statement
- ""#itsdead"" reveals the true situation - the workplace is empty
- coming to work very early (7:30am) contrasts with the lack of customers, emphasizing frustration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the enthusiastic surface sentiment sharply contrasts with the revealed truth
- the use of excessive exclamation marks and capitalization of ""all"" exaggerate the false positivity
- the hashtags explicitly negate the surface meaning and reveal the true frustration

the tweet is clearly using exaggerated positive language to highlight the frustration of coming to work early for no reason, making it decidedly sarcastic.",1.0

- the tweet starts with ""definitely not..."" which seems to express strong disagreement
- it then goes on to make statements about racism being systematic and entrenched
- the tone appears serious and matter-of-fact
- no emojis or obvious sentimental phrases are used

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is responding to someone (@deray), likely disagreeing with a previous statement

- this contradiction between the opening phrase and the following content suggests the ""definitely not..."" is not meant literally
- the user appears to be using irony to emphasize their point about the pervasiveness of racism

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface disagreement in ""definitely not..."" contrasts with the supporting statements that follow
- this mismatch between the opening and the rest of the content is a common sarcastic technique
- the user is likely using sarcasm to emphasize their belief that racism is indeed systematic and entrenched

3. the use of multiple exclamation marks after mentioning work further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

4. the juxtaposition of ""#awesome"" with ""#coldandflu"" reinforces the sarcastic intent, as having a cold or flu is generally not considered awesome.

- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive:
- the quote itself speaks of peace, which is generally positive
- no overtly negative words or phrases are used
- the hashtag #yclnationalcongress seems to be a neutral reference to an event

step 2: true intention
there are several clues that suggest a different intention:
- the use of ""#irony"" as a hashtag is a strong indicator that the author sees irony in the situation
- the juxtaposition of ""people are not fighting for ideas"" with a political context (ycl national congress) suggests skepticism about the sincerity of political rhetoric
- the mention of ""material benefits"" in contrast to ""ideas"" implies criticism of self-interest in politics

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface reading of the quote about peace and ideals contrasts with the implied criticism of political reality. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms that the author sees a contradiction between the words being quoted and the actual situation. this contrast between the seemingly positive message and the critical intention, highlighted by the irony hashtag, strongly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic. the phrase ""exactly what i need"" suggests that the field trip is something desired and beneficial.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. the timing of the field trip (two days before finals) is actually inconvenient and potentially detrimental to exam preparation. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the statement is meant to be interpreted in the opposite way.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (positive, enthusiastic) and the true intention (frustration, criticism of poor timing). the use of ""exactly what i need"" followed by ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure, where a seemingly positive statement is immediately negated to emphasize the opposite meaning.

step 2: true intention
however, the inclusion of ""#sarcasm"" at the end of the statement clearly indicates that the true intention is not genuine curiosity. the author is likely implying that the cause of anxiety is obvious or well-known, and they're using sarcasm to point this out.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the seemingly genuine question posed in the statement and the explicit labeling of the comment as sarcasm. this mismatch, along with the direct use of the sarcasm hashtag, confirms that the statement is indeed sarcastic. the author is likely using this sarcastic tone to critique or mock a situation where the cause of anxiety should be apparent.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at first glance with the phrase ""nice weather for today."" however, this is immediately contradicted by the hashtag ""#not"" and the angry face emoji 😠. these elements create a conflicting surface sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of the statement is to express dissatisfaction or frustration with the weather. the use of ""nice weather"" is actually meant sarcastically, as emphasized by the ""#not"" hashtag. the angry emoji further reinforces the speaker's negative feelings about the weather.

step 3: comparison and analysis

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive or neutral. the phrase ""go to bed 'early' for once"" suggests a positive intention to improve sleep habits. the use of quotation marks around ""early"" might indicate some skepticism, but overall the tone seems straightforward.

step 2: true intention
the true intention reveals frustration and irony. despite attempting to sleep early, the person has been awake since 2 am. the statement about only getting 10 hours of sleep all week further emphasizes the failure of the ""early"" bedtime plan. the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly points out the contradictory nature of the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment of attempting to improve sleep habits and the true outcome of continued sleeplessness. the use of ""early"" in quotation marks now reads as deeply ironic, given the context. the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms the author's intention to highlight the sarcastic nature of the situation.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the speaker describes a dog for sale as ""very annoying"", needing to be ""babied"", and requiring a bath. these are not typically positive selling points for a pet.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be humor or sarcasm. several clues point to this:
1. the exaggerated negative description is unusual for someone genuinely trying to sell a pet.
2. the phrase ""needs babied"" is an informal, somewhat affectionate way of saying the dog needs attention.
3. most importantly, the tweet ends with ""#sarcasm"", directly indicating the speaker's intent.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface negative sentiment contrasts with the likely true intention of humor. the use of the sarcasm hashtag confirms that the speaker is not seriously trying to sell the dog, but rather making a joke about their pet's behavior.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the intention isn't immediately clear to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive.
- the phrase ""i mean"" suggests a casual tone.
- the question ""amirite?"" (am i right?) seeks agreement or confirmation.

step 2: true intention
- the context is unclear without knowing who zach is or the full conversation.
- ""i mean"" can sometimes be used to introduce a sarcastic or ironic statement.
- ""amirite?"" can be used genuinely or sarcastically to emphasize a point.
- the statement ""zach is a teacher"" is presented as if it's meant to explain or justify something, but without context, it's hard to determine if this is sincere or ironic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a potential mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention.
- the casual tone and use of ""amirite?"" could be indicative of sarcasm, especially if the statement about zach being a teacher is meant to be ironic or contradictory to previous information.
- however, without more context, it's difficult to be certain whether this is genuine or sarcastic.

given the ambiguity and the potential for sarcasm in the phrasing, i'm leaning towards a sarcastic interpretation, but with less than full confidence.

Wash hands with water? MOH is rubbing this on everyone's face? #irony http://t.co/sPgfZZIqLO,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning or critical. the use of question marks suggests doubt or skepticism about the advice to wash hands with water. the phrase ""rubbing this on everyone's face"" typically has a negative connotation, implying excessive or annoying repetition of information.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing the ministry of health (moh) for promoting what the author considers to be obvious or trivial advice. the hashtag ""#irony"" is a clear indicator that the author is not taking the message at face value. the linked image (which we can't see) likely provides additional context that reinforces this interpretation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface questioning and critical tone aligns with the true intention of mocking the health advice. however, the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the author is employing sarcasm to make their point. the rhetorical questions are not genuine inquiries but rather vehicles for expressing disbelief or ridicule at what the author perceives as unnecessary or overly simplistic health guidance.

given this analysis, and particularly the explicit use of ""#irony"", i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

Input: ""come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with ewe. http://t.co/ceprvyqlgc""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive keywords: ""lovely weather""
- cheerful tone: ""come on"" suggests enthusiasm
- romantic/festive imagery: ""sleigh ride together""

step 2: true intention
- the tweet appears to be a playful reference to a christmas song lyric
- ""ewe"" is a pun on ""you,"" aligning with the lighthearted tone
- the included link likely leads to an image or content related to the tweet

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention align
- there's no indication of mockery or criticism
- the wordplay is fun rather than sarcastic

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tone is urgent and emphatic, indicated by ""someone tell me"" and ""tf"" (which likely stands for a vulgar intensifier)
- the phrase ""this shit is necessary"" suggests strong desire or importance
- no overtly positive or negative sentiment words are used

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is about finding a fried chicken ornament, which is an unusual and somewhat humorous christmas decoration
- the urgency and emphasis on finding this ornament seems exaggerated for comedic effect
- the use of casual language and slang (""tf"", ""shit"") contrasts with the seeming importance placed on the ornament
- the linked image likely shows the fried chicken ornament, adding to the humor

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment conveys urgency and importance, the true intention appears to be humorous
- the exaggerated importance placed on a novelty ornament suggests the tweet is not meant to be taken literally
- the contrast between the casual language and the stated ""necessity"" of the ornament implies a playful, not serious, tone

given this analysis, i believe the tweet is using humor and exaggeration in a way that could be interpreted as sarcastic. the speaker doesn't literally believe a fried chicken ornament is necessary, but is playfully emphasizing their desire for it.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet expresses frustration or annoyance
- the use of ""#fucccck"" (an elongated form of a swear word) indicates strong negative emotion
- there are no positive keywords or phrases

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely a genuine expression of frustration about insomnia or difficulty sleeping
- the elongated swear word emphasizes the intensity of the frustration
- there doesn't appear to be any hidden meaning or irony

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm isn't immediately obvious to me.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is mixed. ""decemberbessen"" doesn't have a clear sentiment. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#fail"" suggest negativity, while ""#footprint"" is neutral. the word ""sorry"" typically expresses regret or a negative sentiment. the ellipsis (....) might indicate hesitation or trailing off.

step 2: true intention
the combination of hashtags is unusual. ""#not"" could be negating ""#fail"", suggesting that something actually didn't fail. ""footprint"" might refer to an environmental or digital footprint. the ""sorry...."" followed by ellipsis could be insincere or exaggerated. the inclusion of a link suggests the tweet is referring to some content that provides context.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is somewhat negative, but the true intention seems to be more complex. the use of ""#not #fail"" together could be a way of sarcastically saying something did fail. the ""sorry...."" with ellipsis might be a sarcastic apology. without more context, it's difficult to be certain, but there are elements that suggest potential sarcasm.

given the analysis, while not entirely clear, there are enough indicators of potential sarcasm to lean towards that classification.

### Example:
Input: ""is khallilah henriques nnn all there? she mostly sounds blonde,but this morning confirmed it#ignorant on race relations#articulate minority.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""is [she] all there?"", ""sounds blonde"", and hashtags ""#ignorant"" and ""#articulate minority"" suggest a disapproving tone towards the subject.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the tweet appears to be genuinely questioning the subject's intelligence and criticizing her understanding of race relations. there are no clear indicators of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. the tweet expresses a straightforward negative opinion without employing sarcastic devices like exaggeration, mock praise, or ironic contrast.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears apologetic and regretful. the phrase ""hey sorry im late"" suggests a sincere apology for tardiness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is revealed in the second part of the tweet: ""i didnt want to come"". this contrasts sharply with the apologetic tone, indicating that the speaker wasn't actually sorry, but rather intentionally avoided coming. the hashtag ""#myperiod"" adds context, suggesting that the speaker is using their period as an excuse for not wanting to attend.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (apologetic) and the true intention (unapologetically admitting to not wanting to come). this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm. the tweet uses the format of a typical apology but subverts it with honesty about the real reason for being late. the hashtag further emphasizes the sarcastic tone by casually referencing a personal matter as justification.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the beginning suggests amusement or laughter
- the phrase ""lets see"" implies anticipation or curiosity
- no overtly negative words or phrases are present
- the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""lets see if he actually reads it"" implies doubt or skepticism about whether the person in question will read something
- the capitalization of ""reads"" emphasizes this doubt
- the true intention seems to be expressing skepticism or criticism, masked by the initial ""lol""

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the surface sentiment (amusement, curiosity) and the true intention (skepticism, criticism)
- the use of ""lol"" at the beginning appears to be ironic rather than genuine laughter
- the phrase ""lets see if he actually reads it"" is likely meant to be taken as the opposite of its literal meaning, implying that the speaker doesn't believe the person will read it

based on this analysis, the tweet appears to be using irony to express skepticism, which is a form of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward, sincere statement about relationships and judgments of people. the use of ""not everyone"" twice suggests a balanced, thoughtful perspective. the hashtag #irony at the end is a potential indicator of sarcasm, but it's not clear if it applies to the entire statement or just part of it.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to express a nuanced view about human relationships. the author is likely trying to convey that the length of time you've known someone doesn't necessarily correlate with their loyalty or character. the use of #irony suggests that this observation contradicts common assumptions or expectations about relationships.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the statement itself doesn't appear sarcastic in tone or content, the addition of #irony at the end introduces an element of potential sarcasm. however, in this case, the use of ""irony"" might be more about pointing out the paradoxical nature of the observation rather than indicating sarcasm in the traditional sense.

given this analysis, while there's an element of irony indicated, the statement doesn't fit the typical pattern of sarcasm where the literal meaning is opposite to the intended meaning. the #irony tag seems to be used to highlight the counterintuitive nature of the observation rather than to indicate sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet describes two nfl quarterbacks (mike smith and brian hoyer) walking into a bar
- they both say ""i told you it wasn't all my fault""
- the hashtags #coyotes and #browns refer to their respective teams
- on the surface, it appears to be a straightforward anecdote without obvious sentimental keywords or phrases

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is likely not describing a real event, but rather creating a fictional scenario
- the phrase ""i told you it wasn't all my fault"" suggests both quarterbacks are deflecting blame for poor performance
- the author is implying that both quarterbacks have been unsuccessful and are making excuses
- the use of hashtags for both teams indicates the author is drawing a parallel between the two situations

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears neutral, but the true intention is critical and mocking
- the tweet uses a joke format to deliver commentary on the quarterbacks' performances and attitudes
- the humor derives from the implication that both quarterbacks are equally ineffective and unwilling to take responsibility
- the mismatch between the casual scenario described and the underlying criticism indicates sarcasm

given this analysis, i can confidently say:

### Example:
Input: ""auntie just called and said shes on her way..|i better get dressed then :astonished_face::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part is neutral, stating a fact about auntie calling.
- the second part expresses surprise and amusement with the astonished face and laughing emojis.
- the phrase ""i better get dressed then"" could be read as slightly exasperated, but the emojis suggest it's meant lightheartedly.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is genuinely informing about their aunt's imminent arrival.
- they're humorously acknowledging that they're not fully prepared (not dressed yet).
- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention.
- there's no contradiction between the words and the emojis.
- the humor is self-deprecating rather than sarcastic towards others.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and excited. the phrase ""discovered"" suggests a new, interesting finding. ""fun to play with"" directly expresses enjoyment. the inclusion of a link also implies sharing something interesting or amusing.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, this tweet is likely referring to a cat or dog, not a human. the phrasing ""someone discovered"" and talking about a tail being ""fun to play with"" is a playful, anthropomorphic way of describing an animal's behavior. the link is probably to a video or image of a pet playing with its tail.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. there's no contradiction or irony present. the tweet is using a slightly humorous, personified way of describing an animal, but it's not using sarcasm. the intention seems to be genuinely sharing something amusing about pet behavior.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this tweet as:

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. the first sentence seems neutral or slightly positive, describing scouting a new running route. the second part, however, mentions ""crowds, traffic, noise"" which are typically negative elements. the smiling emoji (😄) and ""#not"" send conflicting signals.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear when we consider the elements together:
1. mentioning typically unpleasant urban elements (crowds, traffic, noise)
2. using a smiling emoji (😄) immediately after these negative elements
3. adding ""#not"" at the end

the ""#not"" is crucial here, as it's commonly used to negate or contradict what was just said. this suggests the author is actually describing a peaceful, quiet route, contrary to what the words literally say.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) presents a confusing mix of positive and negative elements. the true intention (step 2) reveals that the author is actually describing a pleasant, quiet running route by sarcastically claiming the opposite. this mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a more accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet starts with a factual statement about blount being out.
- the phrase ""you would think"" suggests an expectation.
- ""white gets some action"" implies a positive opportunity.
- ""i guess not"" at the end indicates disappointment or contradiction.

step 2: true intention
- the author is expressing frustration or disappointment.
- they expected white to get playing time due to blount's absence.
- the ""i guess not"" contradicts the expectation set up earlier in the tweet.
- the tone suggests the author is criticizing the decision not to play white.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the initial expectation and the final outcome.
- the use of ""you would think"" followed by ""i guess not"" is a classic sarcastic structure.
- the author is using this structure to express disappointment and possibly criticize the decision-makers.
- the true intention is to convey frustration, which is masked by the seemingly neutral language.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""#apologies"" suggests a sentiment of regret or admitting fault
- ""*scoffs humble pie*"" is an action description that seems to contradict the apology
- the overall surface sentiment is mixed, with an apology followed by a dismissive action

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""scoffs humble pie"" is an idiom meaning to admit one's mistakes or failings, but ""scoffs"" contradicts this
- the asterisks around ""scoffs humble pie"" indicate it's meant as an action, not just a phrase
- the combination of ""#apologies"" with the contradictory action suggests insincerity
- the true intention appears to be mocking or ridiculing the act of apologizing

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface apology (#apologies) is immediately undermined by the action of scoffing
- this contradiction between words and actions is a common sarcastic device
- the use of hashtag for apologies feels insincere, especially when followed by the mocking action
- the overall tone seems to be making light of the act of apologizing rather than offering a genuine apology

given this analysis, the statement appears to be using sarcasm to mock the idea of apologizing or to express insincere regret.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""#tbt"" (throwback thursday) typically indicates nostalgia or positive reminiscence
- ""#not"" immediately contradicts this, suggesting a negative sentiment
- ""dedicated to those days we dont want to throwback to"" explicitly states a negative feeling
- ""evil cold november day"" uses strong negative language

the surface sentiment is decidedly negative, despite the initial positive connotation of #tbt.

step 2: true intention
- the author is deliberately using the #tbt tag in an unconventional way
- they're highlighting unpleasant memories rather than pleasant ones
- the intention seems to be to humorously subvert the typical use of #tbt
- the link at the end suggests there's an image or post illustrating this ""evil cold november day""

the true intention appears to be making a joke about bad memories, using the framework of a typically positive social media trend.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear mismatch between the initial positive expectation set by #tbt and the actual negative content
- the use of ""#not"" explicitly signals this mismatch
- the exaggerated language (""evil cold november day"") further emphasizes the humorous intent
- the overall structure of the post is designed to set up an expectation and then subvert it

this mismatch between surface expectation and true intention, combined with the humorous tone and deliberate subversion of a social media trend, strongly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""3:30am is a great time to learn the male reproductive system. with the biggest and brightest power point slides ever. #biology""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""great,"" ""biggest,"" ""brightest""
- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrase: ""going to be a great day""
- negative elements: ""#not"" hashtag, sad face emoji 😔

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""today is going to be a great day"" on its own would be positive
- however, the ""#not"" hashtag is used to negate or contradict the preceding statement
- the sad face emoji further reinforces a negative sentiment

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear contrast between the initial positive statement and the following negative indicators
- the use of ""#not"" is a common sarcastic device to express the opposite of what was just said
- the sad emoji confirms that the speaker's true feelings are negative, not positive

given this analysis, the statement is clearly using sarcasm to express that the day is actually not expected to be great.

@MTNza so apparently twitter is free... so why is my data being depleted using twitter? #not impressed,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be confusion or mild frustration. the phrase ""apparently twitter is free"" suggests a neutral or positive expectation, but this is countered by ""why is my data being depleted"" and ""#not impressed,"" which indicate dissatisfaction.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to express frustration and criticism towards twitter and/or mtnza (likely a mobile network provider). the author is pointing out a contradiction between twitter being ""free"" and yet consuming their mobile data. the hashtag ""#not impressed"" reinforces their negative sentiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the initial statement ""apparently twitter is free"" and the subsequent complaint about data depletion. this juxtaposition of a supposedly positive aspect (free service) with a negative consequence (data usage) is characteristic of sarcasm. the use of ""apparently"" further suggests skepticism about the claim of twitter being free. the hashtag ""#not impressed"" serves as a sarcastic understatement of their actual frustration.

based on this analysis, the final label is:

- the phrase ""tough crowd"" suggests a negative or critical audience.
- ""josh smith was tremendous tonight"" is a highly positive statement.
- the surface sentiment appears mixed, with a negative opening followed by strong praise.

step 2: true intention
- ""tough crowd"" is often used sarcastically to imply that a performance or joke didn't land well.
- the stark contrast between ""tough crowd"" and the praise for josh smith's performance is suspicious.
- without more context about josh smith's actual performance, the extreme praise (""tremendous"") could be an exaggeration.
- the tweet seems to be responding to @andrewdbailey, possibly disagreeing with a negative assessment of josh smith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment doesn't align smoothly with the likely true intention.
- the use of ""tough crowd"" followed by extreme praise is a common sarcastic structure.
- the tweet appears to be mocking either josh smith's performance or someone else's assessment of it.
- the brevity and contrast in the statement are typical of sarcastic tweets.

1. the tweet expresses a genuine wish for david to perform with ""his old man"" (likely referring to his father) at an event called ""the carols.""

2. the phrase ""would be also great"" indicates sincere enthusiasm for this potential collaboration.

3. the hashtag ""#greatdou"" (likely meant to be ""#greatduo"") further emphasizes the positive sentiment towards both the potential collaboration and a previous performance (""in both cases"").

4. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements between the words and their intended meaning.

5. the overall tone is straightforward and positive, without any subtle hints of mockery or criticism that might suggest sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll explain my reasoning:

the surface sentiment appears positive with ""always a good thing,"" but the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm. this hashtag is commonly used to negate the preceding statement in a sarcastic manner. additionally, the content itself (taking an hour to defecate) is not typically considered a positive experience, which further supports the sarcastic interpretation.

the combination of an apparently positive statement about an unpleasant situation, followed by the ""#not"" hashtag, creates a clear sarcastic tone. therefore, this tweet can be confidently labeled as sarcastic.",1.0

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of frustration and irony. key phrases like ""devoted to being a boss in beating corruption"" suggest pride and accomplishment, while ""get beat in a corrupt election"" indicates disappointment. the hashtags #irony and #soclosetilden further emphasize a sense of frustration and unfairness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration and pointing out the irony of the situation. the author is likely criticizing the electoral system or their opponents, implying that despite their career fighting corruption, they fell victim to it. the reference to tilden (likely samuel j. tilden, who lost a controversial us presidential election in 1876) and ""#1vote"" suggest a very close and potentially disputed election result.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that the author is using irony to emphasize their point. the statement about being a ""boss in beating corruption"" is juxtaposed with losing in a supposedly corrupt election, creating a sarcastic tone. the use of hashtags like #irony explicitly signals the sarcastic intent.

- the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag directly signals that the statement is meant sarcastically.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- ""happy new year"" and ""liabeeeeee"" (likely an affectionate term) suggest positive sentiment
- laughing expressions ""hahaha"" and laughing emojis ""😂😂😂"" indicate amusement
- ""more clingy moments"" could be seen as positive if clingy is desired

step 2: true intention
- ""trying hard to be fragile and petite"" implies an effort to appear a certain way, possibly not natural
- the laughter and emojis after this statement suggest the speaker finds humor in this effort
- ""more clingy moments"" with laughing emojis could be playfully teasing about clingy behavior

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is mostly positive and playful
- the true intention seems to be gently teasing or poking fun at the effort to appear ""fragile and petite"" and the clingy behavior
- while there's an element of humor directed at these behaviors, it doesn't appear to be biting or mean-spirited
- the overall tone seems affectionate and playful rather than truly sarcastic

given this analysis, i believe the correct label is:

Did you know iOS 8 features custom keyboards? #sarcasm http://t.co/JhuwHjleiu,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears dismissive and unimpressed. key phrases like ""meh"" and ""nothing huge"" suggest a lack of excitement or interest in the described robot arm technology.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually to express amazement and excitement about the mind-controlled robot arm. the article is from a reputable science source (sciencedaily), and the technology described is indeed quite remarkable. the author is using understatement and feigned disinterest to highlight how impressive this development actually is.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (dismissive, unimpressed) and the true intention (amazed, impressed). this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm. additionally, the author explicitly includes the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", removing any doubt about their intent.

- they're expressing frustration about wasted planning and the weather ruining their plans.
- the use of ""that awkward moment"" is a common internet phrase to describe frustrating or ironic situations.
- the hashtag ""#stupidrain"" is a direct expression of annoyance, not meant to be taken literally.

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat positive or amused:
- the use of laughing emoji 😂😂😂😂😂 at the end suggests amusement
- the phrase ""same here"" indicates agreement or shared experience
- no overtly negative words are used

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or difficulty:
- the user is ""tryin to link d convos"" which implies some effort or struggle
- ""but another tweet cums up"" suggests interruption or distraction
- ""#sarcasm is the only wrd repeated"" implies that sarcasm is prevalent and possibly overwhelming in the conversation

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears lighthearted with the laughing emojis, the content of the tweet describes a frustrating experience of trying to follow a conversation but being interrupted by new tweets. the mention of ""#sarcasm"" being repeated suggests that the conversation itself is full of sarcasm, making it difficult to follow.

the laughing emojis at the end, in this context, likely represent a kind of rueful or ironic laughter at the situation rather than genuine amusement. this mismatch between the described frustration and the seemingly amused reaction is indicative of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears positive. the word ""fun"" is typically associated with enjoyment and positive experiences. without context, this statement might seem to be praising drivers who are ""shitty"" as being entertaining or amusing.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is negative. the use of ""shitty"" to describe drivers is clearly derogatory. additionally, the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a common way to negate the preceding statement, indicating that the opposite is true. this suggests that the speaker actually finds bad drivers annoying or frustrating, not fun at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (positive, ""fun"") and the true intention (negative, frustration with bad drivers). the use of ""#not"" explicitly signals that the statement should be interpreted opposite to its literal meaning. this stark contrast between what is said and what is meant is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be pointing out an ironic situation. the author is trying to get an article about madiba (likely referring to nelson mandela) on their site, but technical issues are preventing them from doing so. the use of ""#irony"" at the end explicitly indicates that the author finds this situation ironic.

step 3: comparison and analysis

i can confidently classify this input as sarcastic without going through the step-by-step analysis. here's why:

1. the statement ""i'm not closed-minded, i'm just dogmatic"" is inherently contradictory. being dogmatic is essentially a form of closed-mindedness.

2. the use of tildes (~) around the statement is often used to indicate a mocking or sarcastic tone in text.

3. most importantly, the hashtag #sarcasm is explicitly used, which is a clear indicator that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.

4. the additional hashtag #contradictions further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the statement by drawing attention to the contradiction between claiming not to be closed-minded while admitting to being dogmatic.

given these clear indicators, especially the explicit use of #sarcasm, i can confidently label this input as sarcastic without needing to break down the analysis further.",1.0

A Puppet at the #PTI rally wanting to make #NayaPakistan #irony http://t.co/3kAny6qhKr,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the tweet mentions a ""puppet"" at a rally wanting to make ""#nayapakistan"" (new pakistan). the use of hashtags like #pti (likely referring to pakistan tehreek-e-insaf political party) and #nayapakistan suggest engagement with political discourse.

step 2: true intention
several elements suggest the true intention is critical or mocking:
- the use of ""puppet"" is likely pejorative, implying someone controlled by others.
- the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the author sees irony in the situation.
- the inclusion of an image link suggests visual evidence supporting the author's point.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface-level mention of making a ""new pakistan"" contrasts with the implied criticism of calling someone a ""puppet."" the explicit use of ""#irony"" confirms that the author is pointing out a contradictory or hypocritical situation. this mismatch between the apparent goal (making a new pakistan) and the implied reality (puppetry) strongly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative. the phrase ""can't even begin to explain my frustration"" directly expresses a strong negative emotion. this is further emphasized by the use of the rolling eyes emoji (😒), which typically conveys annoyance or exasperation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely genuinely expressing their deep frustration about a situation. the hyperbolic phrase ""can't even begin to explain"" emphasizes the intensity of their feelings. the emoji reinforces this sentiment rather than contradicting it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. both indicate genuine frustration. while the statement uses some exaggeration (""can't even begin""), this is a common way to express strong emotions and doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm. the emoji supports the literal interpretation rather than suggesting an ironic or sarcastic tone.

Cause I love going to bed alone every night.. #not,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with the statement ""cause i love going to bed alone every night"" expressing enjoyment of sleeping alone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is actually the opposite of the surface sentiment. the use of ""..#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the speaker means the opposite of what they've just said. this hashtag is commonly used to negate the preceding statement in a sarcastic manner.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (love of going to bed alone) and the true intention (dislike of going to bed alone). the use of ""#not"" explicitly signals that the statement should be interpreted oppositely, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this statement as sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: ""one more all nighter and the semester is done""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
- negative phrases: ""kid who tried stealing tools"", ""is now mad""
- the hashtag #irony suggests the author sees irony in the situation
- no overtly positive sentiment or emojis

step 2: true intention
- the author is pointing out the irony of a thief being upset about having something stolen from them
- the use of ""kid"" to describe the thief may be condescending
- the juxtaposition of stealing tools (likely valuable) with hot sauce (relatively trivial) emphasizes the irony

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment is mostly negative, describing a theft attempt and subsequent anger
- the true intention is to highlight the ironic situation and possibly mock the thief
- the use of #irony explicitly signals that the author wants readers to recognize the irony, which is a common element in sarcastic statements
- the contrast between the serious act of stealing tools and the trivial loss of hot sauce creates a humorous effect typical of sarcasm

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""seeing beauty in everything""
- negative phrases: ""sucky thing""
- hashtags: #beautifulliar and #lovethwayyoulie seem positive at first glance
- ""lol"" indicates amusement

the surface sentiment is mixed, with both positive and negative elements.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""sucky thing about seeing beauty in everything"" suggests that what seems positive (seeing beauty) has a downside
- #beautifulliar and #lovethwayyoulie, when examined closely, actually have negative connotations (liar, lie)
- the use of #not at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating the seemingly positive statements before it
- the capitalization of ""not"" emphasizes the sarcastic tone

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment appears mixed, but leans positive with phrases about beauty and love
- however, the true intention is revealed through the careful use of negative connotations in hashtags and the explicit #not
- the contrast between the initially positive-seeming message and the revelation that it's about liars and lies indicates sarcasm
- the use of ""lol"" at the beginning further supports a sarcastic reading, as the author is finding humor in the irony of the situation

step 2: true intention

- the statement is using a play on words and exaggeration to make a point about the nature of waiting
- this kind of clever wordplay and mild exaggeration is often associated with sarcasm or dry humor
- the statement isn't aggressively sarcastic, but it does have a subtle sarcastic or ironic tone

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be making a commentary on modern relationships, particularly those formed or maintained through social media. by equating relationships formed by chance or choice with those formed on facebook, the author is likely critiquing the superficiality or artificiality of social media connections. the use of ""!!"" after facebook adds emphasis, potentially highlighting the absurdity of the comparison.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward observation of an ironic situation. the use of ""#irony"" at the end explicitly points out the ironic nature of the event described.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the irony of a tow truck, which is meant to help vehicles out of ditches, getting stuck in a ditch itself. this is especially ironic given that the road is described as ""very well cleaned,"" suggesting that conditions were good and such an incident shouldn't have happened.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention align in this case. the author is genuinely pointing out an ironic situation, rather than using sarcasm to convey a different meaning. the use of ""#irony"" is sincere and not meant to be sarcastic.

while irony and sarcasm can sometimes overlap, in this case, the statement is simply pointing out a genuinely ironic situation without employing sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a shocking or provocative statement about becoming ""necrophelic"" (presumably meant to be ""necrophilic"") after taking a latin final exam. the hashtags ""#justajoke"" and ""#not intodeadthings"" provide immediate context that contradicts the initial statement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly not to actually claim necrophilia. the author is making a hyperbolic joke about how difficult or ""deadly"" their latin final exam was, using dark humor to express their feelings about the test. the hashtags explicitly state it's a joke and deny any actual interest in ""dead things.""

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface statement (becoming necrophilic) and the true intention (expressing how challenging a latin exam was). the use of extreme exaggeration for comedic effect, combined with the self-aware hashtags that immediately negate the statement, are strong indicators of sarcasm.

- ""unless you are black during the obama administration"" introduces a negative contrast

the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""i guess"" suggests uncertainty, and the statement about paul not having ""buns"" seems factual. the hashtag ""#not"" could be interpreted as a simple negation.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, there are several clues that suggest a sarcastic intention:
1. ""buns, hon"" is likely a play on words, referencing both food and a colloquial term for buttocks.
2. ""#eatenalive"" suggests this is referencing a show or event where someone was supposed to be eaten by an animal.
3. ""#not"" at the end is actually a common way to indicate sarcasm on social media, implying the opposite of what was just said.
4. the @discovery tag implies this is about a discovery channel show, likely one that didn't live up to expectations.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface neutrality contrasts sharply with the underlying mockery. the tweet is using irony to criticize a show (likely on discovery channel) that promised something sensational (""eaten alive"") but failed to deliver. the use of wordplay and the ""#not"" hashtag are clear indicators of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or excited. the word 'important' is used to describe the call, and the phrase ""just what i need"" typically indicates something is welcome or desired. the mention of heading off to disneyland also suggests a positive context.

step 2: true intention
however, several clues indicate the true intention is negative:
1. 'important' is in quotation marks, suggesting skepticism about its actual importance.
2. the timing (an hour before leaving for disneyland) implies the call is actually an inconvenience.
3. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the preceding statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of importance and necessity sharply contrasts with the true intention (step 2) of expressing frustration at an ill-timed, unwanted interruption. the use of positive language to describe a negative situation, coupled with the explicit negation in the hashtag, is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""@tyquorshaaa: jackie just had the best joke i've heard in awhile| :face_with_tears_of_joy::weary_face::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey:""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive phrases: ""best joke i've heard in awhile""
- emojis: face with tears of joy (😂) suggests laughter
- mixed signals: weary face (😩) and see-no-evil monkeys (🙈) hint at discomfort or embarrassment

step 2: true intention
- the use of contrasting emojis (laughing vs. weary/embarrassed) suggests a mismatch between words and feelings
- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface praise of the joke conflicts with the negative emojis
- the exaggerated language combined with conflicting emotions points to sarcasm
- the tweet likely means the joke was actually terrible or inappropriate, not genuinely good

step 1: surface sentiment
- complaint about laptop speakers being ""too quiet"" for music and ""too loud"" for porn
- use of unamused face emoji 😒 suggests frustration or annoyance
- hashtag #irony explicitly points to ironic intent

step 2: true intention
- the statement presents a paradox: speakers are simultaneously too quiet and too loud
- the mention of porn adds an unexpected and somewhat taboo element
- the use of ""simply"" emphasizes the absurdity of the situation
- the hashtag #irony directly indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface complaint about speaker volume conflicts with itself, creating a logical impossibility
- the true intention appears to be highlighting the humor in this impossible situation
- the explicit use of #irony, combined with the contradictory nature of the statement, strongly indicates sarcasm
- the addition of the porn reference likely serves to amplify the humorous and sarcastic tone

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""thanks to"" typically expresses gratitude. the hashtag ""#goodjob"" also seems to convey praise. 

step 2: true intention
however, the context reveals a negative situation. the user is returning a ""brand new ps4"" due to ""faulty security."" this action indicates dissatisfaction, not gratitude. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous statements are meant to be taken oppositely.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the apparently positive surface sentiment (thanking and praising) and the true negative intention (expressing frustration and disappointment). the use of positive language to express a negative sentiment, coupled with the ""#not"" hashtag, is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""didn't focus"" indicates a lack of attention, which is generally seen as negative. there's no overtly positive language used.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear when we consider the context:
- the topic is an adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) lecture.
- adhd is characterized by difficulty focusing or paying attention.
- the hashtag #irony at the end explicitly signals that the statement is meant to be ironic.

the author is pointing out the irony that people with adhd (or people attending an adhd lecture) couldn't focus on a lecture about focusing problems.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (not focusing in a lecture) aligns with what one might expect in an adhd context. however, the explicit labeling of this as irony, combined with the subject matter, indicates that the author is deliberately highlighting this contradiction for humorous effect. this use of irony to comment on the situation is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism of the story and possibly the person telling it (fbhw, likely referring to a radio show or podcast). the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates that the initial positive statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the other hashtags reinforce the negative opinion about the story.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the initial positive statement ""great story"" and the subsequent negative hashtags. the use of ""#sarcasm"" confirms that the initial praise is not genuine. the exaggerated enthusiasm (""!!"") coupled with the stark contrast to the negative hashtags further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the tweet.

- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis

the surface sentiment appears to be a suggestion or advice to ""grind the gym,"" which typically means to work out intensively. the hashtags ""#not #calling #you #fat"" seem to explicitly deny any implication of calling the person fat.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. by explicitly stating ""#not #calling #you #fat,"" the speaker is actually drawing attention to the implication that they are, in fact, calling the person fat. the suggestion to ""grind the gym"" is probably not genuine advice but a veiled insult.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface-level suggestion and the true intention. the use of hashtags to deny an implication actually serves to emphasize that implication. this is a classic sarcastic technique where saying ""not x"" is used to actually suggest ""x."" the overall tone is mocking rather than genuinely helpful.

- the speaker is not seriously suggesting that people in india don't speak english well, nor are they genuinely planning a trip based on language barriers.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment seems positive and lighthearted
- ""officially making"" suggests a playful tone
- creating a special ""day"" for a group of people typically has positive connotations
- mentioning ""smoothie"" adds a casual, fun element

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is likely commenting on an unexpected trend in their customer base for the day
- the creation of this ""day"" is not official, but rather an ironic observation
- there's an implication that this customer demographic is unusual or noteworthy
- the speaker may be expressing surprise or amusement at this pattern

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of creating a special day contrasts with the likely true intention of making a wry observation
- the ""official"" nature of the day is clearly not serious, indicating a mismatch between the literal statement and the intended meaning
- the specificity of ""single men get a smoothie"" day suggests an exaggeration for humorous effect
- the explanation ""because that's who my customers have been all day"" reveals the actual reason for the statement, which is to comment on an observed pattern rather than genuinely create a special day

given this analysis, the statement appears to use irony to humorously comment on an unexpected customer trend. the mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention, along with the exaggeration and playful tone, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""my favorite thing"" suggests a positive surface sentiment about the described activity. this implies enjoyment of waking up early, driving in difficult conditions, and seeing someone.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- waking up at 4 am is generally considered unpleasant.
- driving 20 minutes in snow is typically seen as difficult and undesirable.
- the phrase ""just to see this bitch ass"" is clearly negative and insulting.
- the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#paneraproteam"" suggest dissatisfaction with the situation or the person being referred to.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""my favorite thing"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about the early wake-up, difficult drive, and the person being visited. this mismatch, combined with the insulting language and negative hashtags, strongly suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""great,"" ""biggest,"" ""brightest""
- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""#irony"" at the beginning suggests the author is highlighting something ironic or potentially sarcastic.
- the quote presents two contrasting options for the country's future: ""zionist"" or ""extremist.""
- the statement claims the elections are not about a specific policy (zero vat) but about a fundamental choice for the country's identity.

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""#irony"" implies the author doesn't take the quoted statement at face value.
- the dichotomy presented between ""zionist"" and ""extremist"" is likely an oversimplification or mischaracterization of the political situation.
- the author is likely criticizing the rhetoric surrounding the elections and the way the choices are being framed.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface level presents a serious statement about the nature of the elections.
- however, the ""#irony"" tag and the extreme dichotomy presented suggest the author is actually mocking or criticizing this view.
- the contrast between the seemingly straightforward quote and the irony tag indicates a sarcastic intent.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is clearly negative. the phrase ""pisses me off so bad"" is a strong expression of anger or frustration. the use of ""so bad"" intensifies this negative emotion. the hashtag #theapprentice suggests this is in reference to a tv show context.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. there's no obvious indication of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm. the statement seems to be a straightforward expression of genuine frustration or anger towards a person named katie, likely in the context of the tv show the apprentice.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy. the language is direct and emotionally charged, which is typical for genuine expressions of frustration. there are no contradictory elements or subtle cues that might indicate sarcasm. the use of a hashtag is common in social media to provide context, not necessarily an indicator of sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears critical and confrontational. it points out perceived hypocrisies between k. michelle and lil kim, highlighting physical alterations and career achievements. the use of ""#irony"" at the end suggests awareness of a contradictory situation.

step 2: true intention

- ""god"" used as a term of high praise
- exclamation mark indicates emphasis or strong emotion
- hashtags ""#dimebag"" and ""#darrell"" refer to a specific person, likely with reverence
- ""#pantera"" refers to a band, providing context

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""rest in peace"" is typically used for someone who has died
- however, the hashtag ""#is #not #dead"" directly contradicts this
- this contradiction creates a confusing message
- the use of multiple single-word hashtags may be an attempt to emphasize each word

- the surface sentiment appears respectful and mourning
- the true intention seems to be making a statement that contradicts the typical use of ""rest in peace""
- the contradiction between ""rest in peace"" and ""is not dead"" suggests a sarcastic or ironic tone
- the use of ""riff god"" and the emphasis on ""not dead"" could be interpreted as a fan's passionate assertion that the musician's legacy lives on, but expressed in a sarcastic manner

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly positive. the use of hashtags like #not #forget suggests an earnest attempt to raise awareness. the topics mentioned (#diamond, #humanrights, #bigdata) don't inherently carry strong sentiment, but the context implies a call to remember or consider something important.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be drawing attention to the potentially negative aspects of the diamond industry, particularly in relation to human rights issues. the mention of ""origin"" and ""relation with #humanrights"" suggests the speaker wants to highlight ethical concerns in diamond sourcing and production. the inclusion of #bigdata might imply a call for transparency or deeper analysis of the industry.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface appears neutral or mildly positive in its call to remember, the underlying message is likely more critical of the diamond industry. the use of ""#not #forget"" could be interpreted as a gentle sarcastic nudge, implying that people often overlook or choose to ignore these issues.

however, the overall tone doesn't strongly indicate sarcasm. it appears more as a sincere, if somewhat pointed, reminder about ethical considerations in the diamond industry. the use of hashtags and the direct nature of the message suggest it's more likely an earnest attempt to raise awareness rather than a sarcastic comment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this tweet is to express frustration or disagreement with people who claim that oakland (presumably referring to a school or university) is easier than other schools. the use of ""i love it when..."" is clearly not meant to be taken literally. the angry emoji reinforces the speaker's actual negative feelings about this claim. the ""#not"" hashtag explicitly negates the opening statement, confirming that the speaker does not, in fact, love it when people say this.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""i love it"") is deliberately contrasted with the true negative intention, as indicated by the emoji and hashtag. this stark contrast between what is said and what is meant is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to emphasize their disagreement with the notion that oakland is easier than other schools.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion. the use of ""?!"" at the end indicates a strong emotional reaction, likely shock or disbelief. the phrase ""where did that come from"" suggests the speaker is taken aback by something unexpected.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the tweet appears to be a genuine expression of surprise or confusion in response to something @robinhosking said or did. there's no clear indicator of irony or hidden meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. the tweet expresses straightforward surprise or confusion without employing sarcastic devices like exaggeration, mock praise, or ironic contrast. the direct question and emphatic punctuation suggest sincerity rather than sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet uses vivid, unpleasant imagery (""head filled with snot"", ""cheese grater on throat"")
- the hashtag ""#unimpressed"" explicitly states a negative sentiment
- overall, the surface sentiment is clearly negative and expresses discomfort

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is describing symptoms of a cold or flu in a creative, exaggerated way
- the author is using hyperbole to emphasize how bad they feel
- the hashtag ""#unimpressed"" is likely meant to understate their reaction to feeling ill, which is a form of irony

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (feeling terrible) aligns with the true intention (complaining about being sick)
- however, the use of exaggerated imagery and the understated ""#unimpressed"" introduce a subtle layer of humor and irony
- while not overtly sarcastic, there is a slight mismatch between the dramatic description and the mild ""#unimpressed"" reaction, which could be interpreted as a mild form of sarcasm

after careful consideration, i believe this tweet contains elements of sarcasm, primarily through the contrast between the vivid description and the understated hashtag.

- use of exclamation marks (!!) indicates enthusiasm

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be strongly negative. the phrase ""i am so immensely sad about this"" directly expresses a high degree of sadness or distress.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning or irony. the statement could be genuine, expressing real sadness about something related to the tv show ""cougar town"" or its cast (based on the twitter handles mentioned). however, the use of such strong language (""so immensely sad"") could potentially be an exaggeration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's no clear evidence of sarcasm in this statement. while the intensity of the emotion expressed (""so immensely sad"") could be seen as slightly hyperbolic, this alone doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm. people often use emphatic language on social media to express their feelings about tv shows or celebrities. without more context or clear contradictory elements, it's safer to assume the statement is sincere.

given this analysis, i believe the most appropriate label is:

### label: not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or supportive. the phrase ""that strategy seems to b working so well"" suggests approval of the mentioned drone strike strategy. the ""#not"" at the end could be overlooked in a quick reading.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is strongly critical and disapproving. the suggestion to ""kill their kids in a drone strike"" is deliberately shocking and morally reprehensible. the phrase ""seems to b working so well"" is actually mocking the ineffectiveness and cruelty of such a strategy. the ""#not"" at the end explicitly negates the apparent approval, confirming the sarcastic intent.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the surface approval in step 1 and the actual condemnation in step 2. the tweet uses dark humor and exaggeration to criticize drone strike policies, presenting an absurd and immoral suggestion as if it were a reasonable strategy. the use of ""#not"" further emphasizes the sarcastic nature by explicitly contradicting the surface meaning.

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. ""another day in paradise"" is typically a phrase used to describe a wonderful, idyllic situation. the hashtag #irony is neutral in tone but hints at a potential contrast.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the context. the speaker is on a ""work bus,"" which implies they're commuting to work. most people don't consider their daily commute to work as ""paradise."" the song choice ""another day in paradise"" contrasts sharply with the likely mundane or potentially unpleasant experience of a work commute.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment of ""another day in paradise"" directly conflicts with the implied negative experience of a work commute. the use of #irony explicitly signals that the speaker means the opposite of what is being said. the juxtaposition of the idealistic song lyrics with the mundane reality of a work commute creates a sarcastic tone.

step 1: surface sentiment
- negative sentiment expressed through ""hate my brother even more""
- use of hashtags ""#jk"" (just kidding) and ""#stilljk"" (still just kidding) suggest playfulness
- ""#not"" contradicts the previous ""#jk""
- ""#fatbro"" could be seen as a negative descriptor

step 2: true intention
- the statement about hating the brother is likely not meant literally due to the ""just kidding"" hashtags
- the contradictory hashtags (#jk followed by #not followed by #stilljk) create a playful, teasing tone
- sharing a link indicates the speaker wants to show what the brother did
- the overall tone seems to be lighthearted teasing rather than genuine hatred

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of hatred contrasts with the playful hashtags
- the use of contradictory hashtags and exaggerated language (""hate... even more"") suggests the speaker is not being entirely serious
- the combination of negative statement with playful contradictions is a common sarcastic technique

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- neutral to slightly positive tone
- ""spread their positions"" suggests a strategic financial move
- ""long feeder cattle"" is a specific financial term, neutral in sentiment
- no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis

step 2: true intention
- the presence of ""#sarcasm"" at the end directly indicates the tweet is meant sarcastically
- the financial jargon is likely being used mockingly
- the tweet is probably criticizing or making fun of a financial decision or strategy

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears neutral or mildly positive
- the true intention, as indicated by the #sarcasm hashtag, is to mock or criticize
- there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention
- the use of specific financial terminology adds to the sarcastic effect

given the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" and the analysis of the tweet's content and structure, i can confidently label this as:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as there are some nuances to consider:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""it's all about"" typically indicates importance or focus
- ""twitter"" is neutral
- ""#not a clue"" could be read as a straightforward admission of not understanding

step 2: true intention
- the hashtag ""#not a clue"" is likely used ironically here
- the structure ""it's all about x"" is often used sarcastically to criticize an excessive focus on something
- the contrast between the definitive ""it's all about twitter"" and the admission of having no clue creates a contradictory and likely sarcastic tone

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of importance contrasts with the apparent admission of ignorance
- the use of the hashtag in this way is a common sarcastic device on social media
- the overall structure and contradiction point towards a sarcastic criticism of an overemphasis on twitter

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

- negative phrases: ""don't actually care about the truth"", ""go troll someone else""
- semi-positive ending: winking face emoticon "";-)"" suggests playfulness or friendliness
- mixed signals overall

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is expressing frustration or annoyance with @ban_postgate
- accuses the other person of not caring about truth and of trolling
- the winking emoticon at the end softens the message slightly, but doesn't negate the criticism
- the phrase ""whatever"" indicates dismissiveness

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is mostly negative with a slight positive element at the end
- the true intention is critical and dismissive
- the winking emoticon creates a mismatch between the harsh words and the seemingly friendly sign-off
- this mismatch, combined with the dismissive tone, suggests sarcasm
- the speaker is using a seemingly friendly emoticon to deliver a critical message, which is a common sarcastic technique

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be gratitude and acknowledgment, as indicated by the word ""thanks"". however, this is immediately followed by a statement of misunderstanding (""i thought it was tomorrow""), which creates confusion.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the hashtags at the end:
#not - this negates the previous statement, indicating the speaker didn't actually think it was tomorrow.
#iknow - this further reinforces that the speaker was already aware of the correct information.
#notthepoint - this suggests that the entire exchange is beside the main issue being discussed.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface gratitude and apparent confusion sharply contrast with the true intention revealed by the hashtags. the speaker is using false gratitude and feigned misunderstanding to make a point, likely about the irrelevance or obviousness of the information provided by @kaylabattaglia.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly using sarcasm to communicate frustration or criticism.

the surface sentiment appears critical. the phrase ""we're the narrow minded ones"" suggests self-criticism or admission of narrow-mindedness. the hashtag #irony explicitly points to ironic content.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. the author is implying that the person talking about gender roles is actually the narrow-minded one, not ""we"" (presumably the author and others). the use of ""she talkin bout"" in casual language sets up a contrast with the more formal concept of ""gender roles,"" hinting at mockery.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface self-criticism conflicts with the true intention of criticizing the other person. the hashtag #irony confirms that the statement should not be taken at face value. the author is using sarcasm to point out the perceived hypocrisy or narrow-mindedness of someone discussing gender roles.

step 2: true intention

- ""case of the mondays"" is typically a negative phrase, implying sluggishness or reluctance
- the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of sarcasm, negating the previous statement

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll break down my reasoning:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive at the end with ""woo!"" which typically expresses excitement or joy.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is clearly negative. the author describes a series of unfortunate events: waking up after a long night shift, having no gas, eating a microwave meal, and taking a cold shower. the ""woo!"" at the end is clearly not genuine excitement but rather an ironic exclamation. this is further confirmed by the hashtags #sarcasm and #fml (fuck my life), which explicitly indicate sarcasm and frustration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive ""woo!"" and the negative situation described, along with the explicit #sarcasm hashtag, clearly indicate that this is a sarcastic statement. the author is using irony to emphasize their frustration with their current circumstances.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out hypocrisy or inconsistency. the speaker is noting that a science communicator, who presumably should be accurate, is exaggerating a study about exaggeration in science communication. this creates a circular or self-referential situation that the speaker finds ironic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, but the true intention is to highlight an ironic situation. the use of ""#irony"" explicitly signals that the speaker wants the audience to recognize the contradiction. this contradiction between a science communicator potentially doing exactly what they're criticizing is the core of the sarcastic tone.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of all-caps words like ""logically"", ""not"", ""less protection"", ""deadly virus"", ""ebola"" suggests emphasis and intensity.
- the hashtags (#) throughout the text add a social media context and further emphasis.
- the quotation marks around ""deadly virus"" and ""get"" imply skepticism or questioning of these terms.
- the overall tone seems questioning and somewhat confrontational.

step 2: true intention
- the statement appears to be questioning the logic of a situation, likely related to covid-19 precautions.
- it's implying that if people wear less protection for a supposedly deadly virus and don't contract a serious disease like ebola, then there's an inconsistency in the logic.
- the true intention seems to be to cast doubt on the severity of the virus or the effectiveness of protection measures.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of emphasis and questioning aligns with a sarcastic tone.
- the use of quotation marks around key phrases suggests mockery or disbelief.
- the exaggerated comparison between covid-19 precautions and ebola is a classic sarcastic technique.
- the overall structure of the statement, posing it as a logical question while implying an illogical situation, is characteristic of sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses typical sarcastic devices such as exaggeration, mockery, and implied criticism to question the logic of virus protection measures, making it clearly sarcastic in nature.",1.0

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be self-deprecating and somewhat negative. the phrase ""if only i could be a cooler kid"" suggests a desire to be different. the ""xp"" emoticon and ""lol"" (laugh out loud) add a lighthearted tone. the statement ""i'm such a nerd"" seems to be self-critical. the hashtags appear to be expressing frustration or uncertainty about rejection.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or insecurity through sarcasm. the exaggerated use of hashtags (especially with words like ""can"", ""i"", ""know"") suggests the author is mocking the idea of using hashtags to solve problems or gain popularity. the self-deprecating tone combined with ""lol"" indicates that the author might not truly believe they're uncool or a nerd, but rather is poking fun at the concept of trying to be ""cool"".

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while on the surface it appears to be a straightforward expression of wishing to be cooler and self-criticism, the exaggerated language and use of hashtags suggest that the author is actually mocking these kinds of sentiments. the sarcasm is evident in the contrast between the seemingly sincere wish to be cooler and the ridiculous string of hashtags that follow.

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock the idea that speakers wouldn't know when their talk is over. the question ""otherwise how would they know?"" is rhetorical, implying that it's absurd to think speakers wouldn't naturally know when to conclude. the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag explicitly indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of the word ""struggle"" which implies difficulty
- describing the situation as ""killer"" which typically indicates something extremely challenging or unpleasant

step 2: true intention
analyzing the true intention:
- the phrase ""the struggle is real"" is a common expression, often used humorously or sarcastically to describe minor inconveniences
- using ""killer"" to describe studying and writing an article is likely an exaggeration
- there's no indication of actual life-threatening circumstances, suggesting hyperbole

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overtly negative
- the true intention seems to be expressing frustration, but in an exaggerated way
- the use of hyperbole (""killer"") for relatively common academic tasks (writing an article, studying for a final) suggests sarcasm
- this type of exaggeration is often used in sarcastic statements to emphasize the speaker's feelings about a situation that isn't actually as extreme as described

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

step 1: surface sentiment
- positive sentiment expressed through ""so glad""
- use of the raised hands emoji 🙋 typically indicates excitement or celebration
- overall, the surface sentiment appears very positive about being off work

step 2: true intention
- the phrasing ""so glad"" could be genuine or potentially exaggerated
- being off work is generally seen as a positive thing, aligning with the surface sentiment
- the emoji usage seems to reinforce the positive sentiment
- there are no clear contradictions or context clues suggesting an opposite meaning

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and likely true intention appear to align
- there's no obvious irony, contradiction, or exaggeration that would clearly indicate sarcasm
- while it's possible this could be sarcastic in a specific context we're not privy to, based solely on the text provided, it appears to be a straightforward expression of happiness about not working

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) and the laughing emoji 😆 at the end suggest amusement or humor.
- the statement about the mom's inability to text and talk simultaneously seems neutral or slightly negative.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is likely not genuinely praising their mother's inability to multitask.
- the ""lol"" and emoji, combined with pointing out a perceived flaw, suggest gentle mockery or teasing.
- this kind of comment is often made by younger generations about older generations' struggles with technology.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment appears amused, the true intention seems to be to poke fun at the mother's technological limitations.
- the use of ""lol"" and the emoji are not expressing genuine laughter at a funny situation, but rather amusement at someone's perceived shortcoming.
- this misalignment between the surface sentiment (apparent amusement) and the true intention (mild mockery) is characteristic of light sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears positive. the use of ""ahh..."" suggests nostalgic fondness. the hashtag ""#goodtimes"" explicitly indicates positive memories. the phrase ""i seem to remember (sort of)"" adds a lighthearted, humorous tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment. the speaker is genuinely reminiscing about past experiences at concerts on ""the hill."" the mention of ""mud sliding"" and the slightly hazy memory (""seem to remember (sort of)"") suggest fun, possibly wild times at these events. the speaker is sharing a fond memory with a touch of humor about their potentially intoxicated state during these concerts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the speaker is sincerely recalling good memories from past concerts, with a touch of self-deprecating humor about their state during these events. the tone is nostalgic and positive throughout, without any indicators of sarcasm or irony.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is addressing ""snow"" directly, which is unusual and suggests personification
- the desire to get out of dance early due to snow implies that the speaker hopes for bad weather or difficult conditions
- this contradicts the typical desire for good weather, especially for activities

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the polite, hopeful surface sentiment and the underlying desire for potentially disruptive weather
- addressing an inanimate object (snow) as if it could grant wishes is a common sarcastic device
- the speaker is likely using gentle irony to express frustration with dance or a desire to avoid it, rather than genuinely hoping for snow

given this analysis, i believe the statement is sarcastic. the speaker is using a seemingly positive request to express a contradictory desire, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing amusement or absurdity about an unexpected situation. the speaker is likely making a joke about finding evidence of a stripper's presence without actually seeing a stripper. this kind of humorous observation often employs sarcasm to highlight the absurdity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface confusion and the likely humorous intent. the question is rhetorical, not genuinely seeking an answer. the juxtaposition of ""evidence of a stripper"" with ""no stripper"" creates a comedic effect. the emojis, while seemingly negative, likely emphasize the humorous disbelief rather than genuine frustration.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a philosophical or rhetorical question. the use of #irony as a hashtag suggests that the speaker is pointing out a contradiction or paradox in the concept of missing something one never possessed. this implies a deeper meaning or reflection on the nature of longing and desire.

step 3: comparison and analysis

the surface sentiment appears negative due to:
- use of the word ""stupid"" to describe malaysians

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be critical of mahathir's statement, indicated by:
- the use of quotation marks around ""stupid"", suggesting the author is quoting mahathir rather than agreeing
- the hashtag #irony at the end of the tweet
- the context of mahathir being a former leader of malaysia criticizing his own people

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a contrast between the surface negative sentiment (malaysians being called stupid) and the true intention (criticizing mahathir for making such a statement). the use of the #irony hashtag is a clear indicator that the author is pointing out the irony in mahathir's statement, rather than agreeing with it. this suggests the tweet is meant to be understood sarcastically, critiquing mahathir's words rather than endorsing them.

        ","i think i should approach this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the message appears friendly and helpful on the surface
- offers advice to ""check out the buttons""
- uses a playful winking emoji 😜
- asks to be followed back, which seems casual and friendly

step 2: true intention
- the first part about checking buttons seems genuinely helpful
- however, the ""and follow me back"" with the winking emoji suggests a less sincere motive
- the winking emoji often implies a joke or that something shouldn't be taken too seriously
- the combination of helpful advice and a request for a follow with a wink creates a mixed message

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment appears helpful and friendly, the true intention seems more complex
- the winking emoji suggests the speaker may not be entirely serious about their advice or request
- there's a subtle implication that the advice about buttons might be obvious or unnecessary
- the quick shift from advice to a follow request with a wink could be seen as slightly manipulative or joking

given this analysis, there's a hint of playful sarcasm, particularly in how the message is constructed and the use of the winking emoji. however, it's not overtly or aggressively sarcastic.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""no one really says that"" appears to be a straightforward denial or contradiction.
- there are no obvious emotional keywords or emojis.
- the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative, as it's refuting someone else's statement.

step 2: true intention
- this appears to be a response to someone named holly manthei.
- the phrase ""no one really says that"" could be interpreted literally, or it could be an exaggeration.
- without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is meant to be taken at face value or if there's an underlying meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention seem to align.
- there's no clear indication of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.
- the statement is brief and doesn't contain typical markers of sarcasm like hyperbole or mocking tone.
- however, the use of ""really"" could potentially be emphasizing the statement in a way that might be sarcastic, but this is not definitive.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the straightforward nature of the statement, i'm inclined to classify this as not sarcastic. however, without more context, there's a small chance it could be subtle sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""bullshit,"" ""complete rip off,"" and calling people ""idiots"" indicate strong disapproval. the use of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator of contradiction.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing both wendy williams (or her show/products) and people who might fall for what the author perceives as a bad deal. the statement ""and i bet some of u idiots really that's a good sale"" followed by ""#not"" is clearly meant to contradict the idea that it's actually a good sale.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the literal statement ""some of u idiots really that's a good sale"" and the intended meaning, which is that it's not a good sale at all. the use of ""#not"" is a classic sarcasm indicator, used to explicitly state that the opposite of what was just said is true. this, combined with the overall critical tone and the exaggerated language, strongly indicates sarcasm.

- they're humorously acknowledging that they're not fully prepared (not dressed yet).
- the emojis indicate they find the situation funny rather than annoying.

step 3: comparison and analysis

- there's no contradiction between the words and the emojis.

- the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly philosophical.
- it presents two options as questions: being right or being happy.
- there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis.

step 2: true intention
- this phrase is likely a rhetorical question, implying that being right and being happy are often mutually exclusive.
- the true intention seems to be to provoke thought about prioritizing happiness over always needing to be correct.
- it suggests that sometimes, letting go of the need to be right can lead to greater happiness.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention.
- the statement is thought-provoking but not necessarily sarcastic.
- it doesn't use irony or mock any particular viewpoint.
- the phrasing is more of a philosophical musing than a sarcastic comment.

### Example:
Input: ""my teacher just gave me an ""i feel sorry for you look"" i must look really adorable...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to the use of the word ""adorable,"" which typically has a positive connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""i feel sorry for you look"" from the teacher suggests a negative situation. the contrast between this and claiming to look ""adorable"" indicates irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""adorable"") sharply contrasts with the implied negative situation (teacher feeling sorry). this mismatch is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the author is likely using self-deprecating humor to comment on their own misfortune or appearance.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat negative or self-deprecating. the phrase ""broken down justin bieber"" suggests a less-than-flattering comparison, which typically wouldn't be seen as positive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock or make light of something the philosophy professor said. by attributing this quote to their professor and including the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag, the author is clearly indicating that this statement is not meant to be taken seriously. the comparison to a ""broken down justin bieber"" is likely meant to be humorous and absurd.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (self-deprecating comparison) is actually being used to create a sarcastic effect. the author is using this ridiculous comparison to poke fun at their professor or the situation. the explicit use of the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag removes any doubt about the intended tone.

this tweet appears to be a straightforward product promotion or description, likely for an online listing or advertisement. there are no indicators of sarcasm present. the text is describing a christmas sweater in an enthusiastic manner, emphasizing that it's ""not so ugly"" which seems to be a genuine attempt to promote the product as more appealing than typical ""ugly"" christmas sweaters. the use of capital letters and hashtags is consistent with standard social media marketing practices rather than sarcastic commentary.",0.0

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention.
- the tweet seems to be a simple statement about short hair, possibly showing off a new haircut.
- the ""#really"" emphasizes the shortness rather than contradicting it.

        ","let's analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement begins with positive self-awareness: ""i know who i am.""
- it acknowledges imperfection: ""i'm not perfect.""
- it then makes a bold claim: ""i'm not the most beautiful woman in the world. but i'm one of them.""
- the hashtags include ""#women"" (neutral), ""#not"" (potentially negative), and ""#perfet"" (likely a misspelling of ""perfect"", which could be seen as positive or ironic).
- the quote is attributed to mary j. blige, a well-known singer.

step 2: true intention
- the statement appears to be about self-confidence and embracing one's imperfections.
- the bold claim about being one of the most beautiful women in the world could be interpreted as genuine self-confidence or as an exaggeration for effect.
- the misspelled hashtag ""#perfet"" could be a deliberate play on the idea of imperfection mentioned in the quote.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the statement includes some self-deprecating elements (""i'm not perfect""), it ultimately conveys a message of self-assurance.
- the bold claim about beauty could be seen as humorous self-aggrandizement, but it's consistent with the overall tone of self-confidence.
- the misspelled hashtag adds a touch of irony that aligns with the theme of embracing imperfection.
- given that this is a quote from a public figure known for her confidence and empowering messages, it's likely meant to be taken at face value rather than sarcastically.

### label: not sarcastic

the quote, while containing elements that could be interpreted as humorous or slightly self-deprecating, appears to be a genuine expression of self-confidence and embracing one's imperfections. the overall message aligns with mary j. blige's public persona and the empowering messages she often shares. therefore, it's most likely not intended to be sarcastic.",0.0

### Example:
Input: ""wow writing 3 reviews on 3 concerts i didn't attend is exactly what i want to be doing right now instead of sleeping""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- ""wow"" expressing enthusiasm
- ""exactly what i want to be doing"" suggesting desire and satisfaction

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely negative, indicated by:
- writing reviews for concerts not attended implies dishonesty or pointlessness
- mentioning ""instead of sleeping"" suggests the task is interfering with a basic need
- the exaggerated specificity (""3 reviews on 3 concerts"") hints at frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the seemingly positive surface sentiment and the clearly negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using exaggeration and false enthusiasm to express their actual frustration and displeasure with the task.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the hashtag #irony suggests the author is pointing out some inconsistency.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be criticism or calling out hypocrisy. the author is implying that someone (likely ""she"" referred to in the tweet) is criticizing effigies of jesus or allah while not having hindu gods themselves, which the author sees as inconsistent or hypocritical.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't a stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intention in this case. the use of ""#irony"" is a direct indicator that the author is pointing out a contradictory or hypocritical situation. while this isn't classic sarcasm with an overtly positive surface sentiment masking a negative intention, the use of irony to point out inconsistency is a form of sarcastic expression.

given this analysis, i believe the correct label is:

### label: sarcastic

I have three exams today lets gooooo! #School #Sarcasm #Swag,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears positive due to:
- the enthusiastic ""lets gooooo!"" exclamation
- the use of ""#swag"" which is often associated with positive, cool attitudes

step 2: true intention
several clues suggest the true intention is likely negative:
- having three exams in one day is generally considered stressful and undesirable
- the explicit use of ""#sarcasm"" in the hashtags clearly signals the author's sarcastic intent
- the exaggerated ""gooooo"" could be read as over-the-top false enthusiasm

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""lets gooooo!"" and ""#swag"") contrasts sharply with the likely negative feelings about having multiple exams. this mismatch, combined with the explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag, clearly indicates that the statement is sarcastic.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase ""feelin real good today"" suggests a positive feeling. the greeting ""welll helllo"" also seems friendly and upbeat.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, several elements reveal the true intention:
1. the mention of ""fever"" and ""103"" (presumably referring to a high temperature) contradicts feeling good.
2. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous statement is meant to be taken as the opposite.
3. the exaggerated spelling in ""welll helllo"" could be read as dramatic or sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""feelin real good"") directly conflicts with the implied negative experience of having a high fever. the use of ""#not"" explicitly reverses the meaning of the statement. this stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

- the tweet appears to be a playful jab rather than genuinely hurtful
- the contrasting elements (criticism vs. love, annoyance vs. shout out) suggest a sarcastic or ironic tone

given the analysis, i believe this tweet is using sarcasm to express a complex parent-child relationship. the author is likely using exaggeration and contrast for humorous effect, while still conveying genuine affection.

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet appears neutral on the surface
- no overtly positive or negative words
- the hashtag #irony suggests some form of ironic intent

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is addressing two users, @moansar and @louisemensch
- the phrase ""talking to yourself again mo"" implies that mo (likely @moansar) is engaging in a one-sided conversation
- the use of ""again"" suggests this is a recurring behavior
- the hashtag #irony is used to explicitly point out the ironic nature of the situation

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface neutrality masks a more critical intention
- the tweet is implying that mo is engaging in a pointless or self-serving dialogue
- the use of #irony confirms that the tweet is meant to be understood as sarcastic or ironic
- the sarcasm is directed at mo's behavior, suggesting it's foolish or unnecessary

based on this analysis, i can confidently say:

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. the use of hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#oxymoron"" suggests a critique. the phrase ""planned parenthood"" in quotes indicates focus on this term. the final statement ""nothing abt parenting"" is a direct negative comment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be criticizing planned parenthood. by using ""#irony"" and ""#oxymoron"" alongside ""planned parenthood"" in quotes, the author is suggesting that the organization's name is contradictory to its actual function. the final statement reinforces this by claiming the organization has nothing to do with parenting.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) is relatively mild, using hashtags and quotation marks to imply criticism indirectly. however, the true intention (step 2) is a sharp critique of planned parenthood, suggesting its name is misleading. the use of ""#irony"" and ""#oxymoron"" explicitly signals the author's sarcastic tone, highlighting the perceived contradiction between the organization's name and its activities.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously point out the futility of trying to eat quietly in a silent area. the addition of ""#not"" at the end is a clear indicator that the previous statement is meant to be taken ironically. the author is actually implying that no matter how slowly they chew, it will still be noticeable.

- the included link probably leads to an image or article explaining the situation

- the phrase ""and then there were none"" could be used dramatically, but not necessarily sarcastically

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""all nighter"" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting stress or exhaustion. however, ""the semester is done"" implies a sense of relief or accomplishment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is likely expressing a factual statement about their current situation - they need to pull one more late night of studying or work, and then their academic semester will be complete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward expression of the speaker's current academic situation, without any apparent irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears strongly negative. the phrase ""have the blood of those cops on their hands"" is a very serious accusation, implying responsibility for harm or death. the tone is accusatory and harsh towards the mentioned parties (mainstream media, obama, holder, deblasio).

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the statement appears to be a genuine expression of anger and blame towards the mentioned parties, holding them responsible for some incident involving police officers. the inclusion of ""no doubt"" at the beginning emphasizes the speaker's certainty in this accusation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there doesn't seem to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement is direct, forceful, and doesn't employ any typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or unexpected twists. the language is consistent with someone expressing a sincere, albeit controversial, opinion.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

label: not sarcastic

the statement appears to be a genuine expression of the speaker's beliefs and accusations, without any indication of sarcasm.",0.0
@coreybking thanks for the spoiler!!!! #not,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and grateful. the use of ""thanks"" and multiple exclamation marks suggest enthusiasm and appreciation. the hashtag ""#not"" is present but could be interpreted different ways initially.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention is likely frustration or annoyance at having a spoiler revealed. the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a key indicator that the preceding statement is meant to be interpreted oppositely. this is a common internet shorthand for sarcasm or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface-level gratitude and the likely actual feeling of frustration. the exaggerated thanks (with multiple exclamation points) followed by the contradictory ""#not"" is a classic sarcastic structure. the author is using verbal irony to express their displeasure about having something spoiled for them.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: ""@outsilver87 @lasvegascapper ya, because if history has told us anything, it's that betting on sports is a great way to make money!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""ya"" (informal ""yes"") and ""great"" in all caps suggests strong agreement and enthusiasm.
- the phrase ""betting on sports is a great way to make money"" appears to be a positive statement about sports betting.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if history has told us anything"" is often used to introduce a contradictory statement.
- the exaggerated use of ""great"" in all caps hints at overstatement.
- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overly positive about sports betting.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""@zachsellsmagic i thought all people did for the holiday was to stream holiday cube all day?!?!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""well maybe if you weren't such a noob"" appears negative and critical.
- ""you would be up talking to me at 2:30 in the morning"" suggests disappointment or frustration.
- the "":p"" emoticon (sticking out tongue) at the end softens the tone and indicates playfulness.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is likely not actually criticizing the other person for being a ""noob.""
- the late-night timing and playful emoticon suggest this is friendly banter.
- the true intention seems to be playfully teasing a friend for not staying up late to chat.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the seemingly critical words and the playful intention.
- the use of exaggerated language (""such a noob"") and the contrasting emoticon are typical of sarcastic humor.
- the speaker is using mock criticism to express affection or friendship, a common sarcastic technique.

based on this analysis, i can confidently classify this as:

        ","given the limited context provided by the input ""#not insured"", i don't have enough information to confidently determine whether this is sarcastic or not without more context. therefore, i'll walk through the steps to analyze it:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""not insured"" on its own is neutral to slightly negative
- the hashtag format suggests it's meant to be a categorization or comment

step 2: true intention
- without more context, the true intention is unclear
- it could be a straightforward statement about lack of insurance
- alternatively, it could be a commentary on a situation where insurance would have been beneficial

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's not enough information to definitively determine if there's a mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention
- the use of ""#not"" could potentially be a sarcastic marker, but it's not conclusive without more context
- the brevity of the statement makes it difficult to detect any clear rhetorical devices or style indicators of sarcasm

given the lack of clear sarcasm indicators and the ambiguity of the short statement, i would lean towards classifying this as:

label: not sarcastic

however, i want to emphasize that this classification has low confidence due to the limited context provided. more surrounding text or information about the situation being referenced would be necessary for a more accurate determination.",0.0
Horray to working all weekend! #sarcasm #ohwell 💰💰👍😏,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

i'm confident in this classification without needing to go through the step-by-step process. the reasons for this judgment are:

1. the use of ""horray"" (likely meant to be ""hooray"") in conjunction with ""working all weekend"" creates an immediate contrast between a celebratory exclamation and a typically undesirable situation.

2. the explicit use of the hashtag #sarcasm directly indicates the author's intent.

3. the combination of emojis at the end, particularly the money bags (💰💰) followed by the smirking face (😏), further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

4. the hashtag #ohwell suggests a resigned attitude, which contrasts with the initial enthusiastic ""horray,"" adding to the sarcastic tone.

these elements together create a clear sarcastic message about the displeasure of working on the weekend, despite the superficially positive opening.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""the true definition - #iran hosting a conference against extremist! http://t.co/bt5ujr1cpa""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral. the phrase ""the true definition"" suggests something genuine or authentic. the exclamation mark after ""extremist"" could indicate enthusiasm or emphasis.

step 2: true intention
the use of ""the true definition"" is likely ironic, implying the opposite. iran, often associated with supporting extremism, hosting a conference against extremism creates a stark contradiction. the exclamation mark now reads as exaggerated disbelief rather than enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (step 1) of authenticity and possible enthusiasm sharply contrasts with the likely true intention (step 2) of pointing out hypocrisy or absurdity. this mismatch between apparent meaning and intended meaning is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems positive or neutral. ""munching cheese"" suggests enjoyment, and comparing it to christmas implies a special or celebratory feeling. the hashtag ""#stiltonoverload"" could be seen as enthusiastic about the amount of cheese being consumed.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing mild amusement or self-deprecation about eating too much cheese. the comparison to christmas (typically a time of indulgence) and the use of ""overload"" suggest the person is aware they're eating more cheese than usual or perhaps more than they should.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive, the true intention carries a hint of self-aware humor about overindulgence. the use of hyperbole (comparing cheese eating to christmas) and the somewhat exaggerated hashtag ""#stiltonoverload"" suggest a light-hearted, mildly self-mocking tone. this subtle contrast between enthusiasm and awareness of excess indicates a mild form of sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i would classify this as:

label: sarcastic

the sarcasm here is gentle and self-directed, rather than bitter or critical, but it does employ typical sarcastic devices like hyperbole and a contrast between surface enthusiasm and underlying self-awareness.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""@outsilver87 @lasvegascapper ya, because if history has told us anything, it's that betting on sports is a great way to make money!""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the use of ""ya"" (informal ""yes"") and ""great"" in all caps suggests strong agreement and enthusiasm.
- the phrase ""betting on sports is a great way to make money"" appears to be a positive statement about sports betting.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if history has told us anything"" is often used to introduce a contradictory statement.
- the exaggerated use of ""great"" in all caps hints at overstatement.
- historically, most people lose money betting on sports, not gain it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is overly positive about sports betting.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea that sports betting is profitable.
- the stark contrast between the surface meaning and the implied meaning indicates sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the tweet describes a ""hazard worker training"" session
- mentions donuts and smoking breaks, which could be seen as neutral or positive elements of a work day
- uses hashtags like #fail and #irony, which suggest negative sentiment
- mentions @mealfit and @crossfit, which are associated with fitness and health

step 2: true intention
- the author is pointing out the irony of unhealthy behaviors (eating donuts, smoking) during a hazard worker training
- the hashtag #nomealfitters implies criticism of the lack of fitness-conscious choices
- tagging @mealfit and @crossfit emphasizes the contrast between the described scene and health-focused practices

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface description of the training session contrasts sharply with the implied criticism
- the use of hashtags like #fail and #irony explicitly signal the author's disapproval and sarcastic intent
- the juxtaposition of unhealthy choices in a safety-oriented setting is meant to highlight absurdity

given this analysis, the tweet is clearly using irony to criticize the contradictory nature of the described situation.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis

in the context of sports (mcfc likely refers to manchester city football club), ""kill"" is often used figuratively to mean ""defeat decisively"" or ""outperform significantly."" the true intention is likely to praise mcfc for playing exceptionally well or dominating their opponents in a match or competition.

there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (which seems violent and negative) and the true intention (which is likely positive, praising the team's performance). the use of hyperbole (""kill"" instead of ""defeat"") and the contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning are classic indicators of sarcasm in sports commentary.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the context requires some analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative
- the phrase ""yet no..."" suggests a criticism or complaint
- the hashtag #irony indicates the author is pointing out something contradictory

step 2: true intention
- the author is commenting on a story or situation involving @susancalman and @claireofthorpe
- they're pointing out that despite the story being referred to as a ""dog in the manger"" story, it doesn't actually contain a dog in a manger
- the use of quotation marks around ""dog in the manger"" suggests it's being used idiomatically
- the hashtag #irony indicates the author finds this contradiction amusing or noteworthy

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of complaint aligns with the true intention of pointing out a contradiction
- however, the use of ""#irony"" suggests the author is more amused than genuinely upset
- the tweet is pointing out a literal interpretation of an idiomatic phrase, which is a common form of wordplay or mild sarcasm
- while there's an element of criticism, it seems to be delivered in a light-hearted, observational manner rather than harsh sarcasm

label: not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and mocking. the use of ""#irony"" and ""#lol"" suggests the author finds something humorous or contradictory in the situation. the phrase ""sky fairy"" is a derogatory term often used by atheists to refer to god, indicating skepticism or derision towards religious beliefs.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting what the author perceives as hypocrisy or inconsistency in religious teaching. the author is drawing a parallel between santa claus and religious beliefs, implying that both are fictional but treated differently by the reverend. the use of ""sky fairy"" and the contrast with santa being declared not real emphasizes the author's view that religious beliefs are equally implausible.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface-level use of ""#irony"" and the deeper critique being made. the author is using sarcasm to point out what they see as an logical inconsistency in religious teaching. the hashtag ""#lol"" further emphasizes the author's mocking tone and sarcastic intent.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""great,"" ""biggest,"" ""brightest""
- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings
- the overall tone suggests the author is actually complaining about their study situation while pretending to be excited

- no explicitly positive or negative words
- factual statement about laborers suffering from food insecurity
- hashtags #irony and #poverty indicate a critical perspective

step 2: true intention
- highlighting the contradiction between a highly productive agricultural region and the poverty of its workers
- drawing attention to the unfairness of this situation
- using #irony to emphasize the absurdity of food producers lacking food security
- criticizing the systemic issues that lead to this paradox

step 3: comparison and analysis

- the use of #irony explicitly signals the author's intent to highlight the contradiction

### Example:
Input: ""really looked forward to waking up this early for finals......""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""looked forward to"" typically indicates positive anticipation. this suggests a surface-level positive sentiment about waking up early for finals.

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is likely negative:
- the use of ""really"" at the start often signals sarcasm.
- finals are generally stressful and not eagerly anticipated.
- waking up early is usually considered unpleasant.
- the excessive ellipsis (......)  at the end implies a trailing off, often used to convey skepticism or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface positive sentiment (""looked forward to"") sharply contrasts with the likely negative true feelings about early mornings and finals. this mismatch, combined with the linguistic clues, strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the speaker is describing an action their friend took, which could be seen as playful or fun (""cuz she's fun like that"").

step 2: true intention
several clues indicate the true intention is negative or sarcastic:
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the statement as sarcastic.
- the phrase ""cuz she's fun like that"" is likely meant ironically, implying the friend's action wasn't actually fun or appreciated.
- ""#brat"" at the end suggests the speaker views their friend's action negatively.
- the context of sending a snapchat of someone ""drinkin water"" doesn't seem particularly interesting or fun, which adds to the sarcastic tone.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat negative or frustrated. the tweet suggests that girls are not answering the author's phone calls because they assume he's calling to ask them out early, which implies a dating context.

step 2: true intention
the true intention reveals a twist: the author claims he's actually calling to ""cut them,"" which means to end the relationship or stop seeing them. this is unexpected and contradicts the assumed reason for calling. the use of ""#irony"" at the end explicitly signals that the author is pointing out the ironic nature of the situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface reading (girls avoiding calls from a potentially eager suitor) and the claimed true intention (the caller wanting to end things). this reversal of expectations, combined with the explicit use of ""#irony,"" strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is likely using this ironic situation to make a humorous comment about dating dynamics or miscommunication.

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or confusion, indicated by the use of multiple punctuation marks (""?!?!"") and the phrase ""i thought,"" which suggests a mistaken belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to humorously exaggerate and mock the idea that streaming holiday cube (likely referring to a magic: the gathering format) is the only activity people engage in during holidays. the author is using hyperbole to comment on the popularity of this activity among a certain group.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of genuine surprise contrasts with the true intention of mocking exaggeration. this mismatch between the literal statement and the implied meaning is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize or mock the perceived avoidance of using the word ""christmas."" this is evident from:
1. the exaggerated warning not to say ""christmas""
2. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm""
3. the contradictory hashtag ""#itisachristmastree""

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be criticism of grayling's actions. the juxtaposition of banning prison books and attempting to ban judicial reviews implies that grayling is restricting access to both knowledge (books) and legal recourse (judicial reviews). the use of ""of course"" in this context likely indicates sarcasm, suggesting that grayling's actions are predictably restrictive or authoritarian. the ""#irony"" hashtag further reinforces that the statement is not to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreement conveyed by ""of course"" contrasts sharply with the underlying criticism of grayling's actions. the tweet uses sarcasm to highlight what the author sees as a pattern of restrictive policies. the inclusion of the ""#irony"" hashtag explicitly signals that the statement is intended to be understood as ironic or sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface compliment ""you seem super smart"" and the likely intention to criticize or mock the retweeted opinion. this discrepancy, combined with the controversial nature of the topic, strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is likely using irony to highlight what they perceive as an unintelligent or morally questionable stance on waterboarding.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment seems positive at first, with the mention of ""getting cooked breakfast"" implying a nice gesture.
- however, the phrase ""hes defo up to something"" introduces suspicion.
- the emojis used (😕😮😆😆) convey a mix of confusion, surprise, and amusement.

step 2: true intention
- the author is suggesting that the act of getting a cooked breakfast is unusual and therefore suspicious.
- the phrase ""hes defo up to something"" implies that this nice gesture is out of the ordinary and might have an ulterior motive.
- the use of laughing emojis at the end suggests the author finds humor in this situation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a clear contrast between the positive act (cooked breakfast) and the suspicious interpretation.
- the author is using humor to imply that something good (breakfast) must have an hidden agenda.
- this juxtaposition of a nice gesture with suspicion, combined with the amused tone, strongly suggests sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can confidently say:

label: sarcastic

the tweet uses the unexpected kindness of a cooked breakfast to sarcastically imply suspicion, creating humor through the contrast between the nice gesture and the playful accusation of ulterior motives.",1.0

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step, as the sarcasm in this tweet is not immediately obvious without more context.

step 1: surface sentiment
- ""roflmao"" (rolling on the floor laughing my ass off) indicates extreme amusement
- ""yeah"" suggests agreement
- ""oops"" in all caps might indicate emphasis on a mistake or accident

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""roflmao"" seems exaggerated for the context
- ""yeah, oops is right"" suggests a mocking or critical tone, implying that someone made a significant mistake
- the multiple @ mentions indicate this is part of a conversation where the speaker is likely responding to or commenting on something said by others

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the extreme amusement expressed by ""roflmao"" seems disproportionate to the simple agreement with ""oops""
- the exaggerated laughter combined with the emphasis on a mistake (""oops"") suggests the speaker is not genuinely amused, but rather mocking or criticizing
- the contrast between the surface amusement and the likely critical intention points to sarcasm

based on this analysis, i believe the tweet is sarcastic. the exaggerated expression of amusement is likely used to mock or criticize something said or done by one of the mentioned users.

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

        ","i'll need to think through this step-by-step, as the input is somewhat ambiguous and requires careful analysis.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is difficult to determine. the repetition of ""coin!"" and the username ""lecoincanard"" don't convey clear emotion. the phrase ""have a wank over this hashtag"" could be interpreted as crude or dismissive, but without more context, it's hard to be certain.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or making light of hashtag culture. the repetitive ""coin!"" exclamations followed by the crude suggestion to ""have a wank over this hashtag"" implies a dismissive or satirical attitude towards social media trends and hashtag usage.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is unclear, the likely intention is to mock or satirize. the use of repetition and crude language to comment on hashtag culture suggests a sarcastic tone. the statement isn't straightforwardly sincere, but rather uses exaggeration and shock value to make a point about social media behavior.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is intended to be sarcastic.

- romantic/festive imagery: ""sleigh ride together""

step 2: true intention

- ""ewe"" is a pun on ""you,"" aligning with the lighthearted tone
- the included link likely leads to an image or content related to the tweet

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- positive words: ""great,"" ""biggest,"" ""brightest""
- enthusiasm about learning at 3:30am and using large, bright slides

step 2: true intention
- 3:30am is generally considered a very inconvenient time for studying
- exaggerated language about slide size and brightness seems unrealistic
- the hashtag #biology adds a sense of forced positivity

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity contrasts sharply with the likely frustration of studying at such a late hour
- the exaggerated praise for the powerpoint slides further emphasizes the disconnect between words and probable feelings

- there's a question about padding, which could be interpreted as genuine concern for safety

step 2: true intention
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" at the end explicitly indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value
- the question about padding suggests that there likely wasn't any padding, and the fall was probably onto a hard surface
- the seemingly concerned tone is actually mocking the situation

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface concern contrasts sharply with the true intention of mocking or making light of what was likely a painful incident
- the use of the sarcasm hashtag removes any ambiguity about the author's intent
- the question about padding is likely rhetorical, emphasizing the sarcastic nature of the comment

- the surface sentiment appears somewhat positive or neutral
- ""hope"" is generally a positive word
- there's no overtly negative language or insulting terms
- the tone seems casual and friendly

step 2: true intention
- the tweet is referencing a header (likely in a soccer/football context) and its potential impact on someone's hair (""barnet"" is british slang for hairstyle)
- the implication is that a powerful header might mess up someone's carefully styled hair
- there's a subtle contrast between the physical action of heading a ball and concern for one's hairstyle
- this juxtaposition could be seen as gently mocking or teasing

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment is somewhat positive, the true intention appears to be light teasing
- the contrast between the athletic action and concern for appearance creates a subtle humorous effect
- however, the sarcasm, if present, is very mild and could be interpreted as friendly banter
- the statement could be genuine concern or mild teasing, depending on the relationship between the tweeter and @lawsondath92

- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

3. the last sentence ""always trying to learn"" feels slightly disconnected from the specific task mentioned, which could be a hint of insincerity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is positive and straightforward, the true intention seems to be conveying frustration or criticism, possibly aimed at a lack of support or unreasonable expectations. the speaker appears to be using exaggerated enthusiasm about an obscure task to highlight the absurdity of the situation.

given this analysis, i believe there's a strong possibility that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is likely using a positive tone to mask criticism or frustration.

step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part of the tweet appears to be a straightforward news headline about protesters taking to the streets over a decision related to a chokehold death.
- the second part ""/mexico's streets aren't the only ones taken"" seems to be an additional comment, comparing the situation to mexico.
- the surface sentiment is fairly neutral, reporting on events.

step 2: true intention
- the news headline portion is likely meant to be taken at face value, reporting on actual protests.
- the added comment about mexico's streets appears to be drawing a parallel between the reported protests and some situation in mexico.
- however, this comparison seems unnecessary and potentially dismissive of the original protest's significance.
- the phrasing ""aren't the only ones taken"" implies a sense of competition or equivalence between different protest situations, which may be inappropriate given the serious nature of the original protest.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the straightforward reporting in the first part and the somewhat flippant comparison in the second part.
- the addition of the mexico comment seems to downplay the importance of the original protest by suggesting it's not unique or particularly noteworthy.
- this subtle undermining of the protest's significance through an unnecessary comparison is a hallmark of sarcasm.
- the sarcasm here is not overt, but rather lies in the implication that the protests aren't as significant as they might seem because ""mexico's streets aren't the only ones taken.""

based on this analysis, i believe the tweet is subtly sarcastic.

i'm confident in this judgment, but i'll briefly explain my reasoning:

the tweet contains clear markers of sarcasm:

1. the use of ""#tgif"" (thank god it's friday) followed immediately by ""oh just kidding"" explicitly signals the opposite sentiment.

2. phrases like ""love 12 hour days"" and ""#nolife"" are likely meant ironically, as most people don't actually enjoy such long work days.

3. the inclusion of ""#sarcasm"" is a direct indicator that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

4. the overall tone contrasts the typical positive tgif sentiment with the reality of a difficult work schedule, emphasizing the sarcastic intent.

these elements combined make it clear that the tweet is sarcastic in nature.",1.0

### Example:
Input: ""students too busy protesting a grand jury decision to study deserve to fail. actions have consequences.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and unsympathetic towards protesting students. key phrases like ""deserve to fail"" and ""actions have consequences"" suggest a harsh, judgmental tone.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the statement likely aims to critique the notion that civic engagement should be penalized academically. the exaggerated stance that students ""deserve to fail"" for participating in protests is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of such a view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the surface-level harsh judgment and the likely intention to criticize such judgment indicates sarcasm. the statement employs hyperbole to make a point about the value of civic engagement versus the potential academic consequences.

however, several elements indicate a negative true intention:
- the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#boo"" explicitly negate the positive statement.
- ""#fog"" suggests poor driving conditions.
- ""#work"" implies the person has to go to work, which is often viewed negatively.
- the shocked/flustered emoji 😳 repeated three times suggests stress or frustration.
- the inclusion of a link (likely an image of foggy conditions) further emphasizes the negative driving situation.

- overuse of see-no-evil monkeys implies wanting to unsee or forget something
- capitalization of ""best joke"" may indicate exaggeration

- the statement appears to be questioning the logic of restaurants' policies on breastfeeding.
- the use of ""thrive on the social nature of eating"" suggests a positive view of social dining.
- the hashtag #irony is a direct indicator that the author sees contradiction in the situation.

step 2: true intention
- the author is pointing out a contradiction between restaurants encouraging social interaction and simultaneously discouraging public breastfeeding.
- the question format is rhetorical, not seeking an actual answer but rather highlighting the perceived absurdity of the situation.
- the use of ""only"" in ""only breastfeed in private"" emphasizes the restrictive nature of such policies.

step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface question contrasts with the author's clear disagreement with the implied policy.
- the use of #irony explicitly signals the author's sarcastic intent.
- the rhetorical question format is a common device for expressing sarcasm.

there's a clear mismatch between the surface positive sentiment (""shweeeet"") and the true negative intention revealed by the context and the ""#not"" hashtag. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm. the author is using irony to express their displeasure about the upcoming drive.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears emotional and sympathetic. key phrases like ""sheds tears"" and ""it makes me weak"" indicate sadness and emotional vulnerability. the emoticon "";_;"" further reinforces this sentiment, representing crying or sadness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the user appears to be genuinely expressing empathy and emotional connection to jessica (presumably a k-pop idol) crying at her fan signing event. the comment ""it makes me weak everytime sica"" suggests this is a recurring emotional response from the fan towards jessica (nicknamed sica).

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the language used is straightforward and emotionally sincere, without any indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm. the user seems to be genuinely affected by jessica's emotional display.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### Example:
Input: ""@davidvitty to watch re blues? chelsea's of course""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""of course"" could indicate enthusiasm or certainty about watching chelsea's blues.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the ""of course"" likely carries a different tone. it suggests obviousness or inevitability, potentially mocking the idea of watching chelsea. the question format and brevity also hint at a dismissive attitude.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface enthusiasm conflicts with the underlying dismissive tone. the ""of course"" is likely used ironically to imply the opposite - that watching chelsea is not desirable or worth consideration.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly confused. the use of ""#irony"" at the beginning suggests some level of sarcasm or contradiction. the phrase ""or something"" at the end indicates uncertainty or dismissiveness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or ridiculing the idea that al jazeera would support anti-gamergate due to feminism. the ""or something"" phrase is likely used sarcastically to imply that the connection between al jazeera, anti-gamergate, and feminism is absurd or poorly reasoned.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface neutrality contrasts with the underlying mockery. the use of ""#irony"" at the beginning explicitly signals that the statement should not be taken at face value. the structure of the sentence, presenting a seemingly factual statement followed by ""or something,"" is a common sarcastic technique used to undermine the credibility of the statement itself.
