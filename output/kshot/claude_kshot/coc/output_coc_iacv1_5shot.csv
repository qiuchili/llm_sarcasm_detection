### Example:
Input: ""said the troll that lives in the uk""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no overtly positive or negative words, emojis, or sentimental phrases. the statement is matter-of-fact in tone.

step 2: true intention
the statement seems to be a straightforward description or attribution of a quote to someone characterized as a ""troll"" who lives in the uk. while calling someone a ""troll"" can be negative, the overall intention appears to be simply identifying the source of a previous statement.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely attempting to explain a logical fallacy in the reasoning about god's nature and omnipotence. the intention is to provide a thoughtful, rational critique of the original question.

Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what?

""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required.

### Example:
Input: ""are you trying to make a point here? or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   one of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. there's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with tv shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   we need massive reform. we gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.""

### Example:
Input: ""the anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the statement appears neutral in tone. it uses matter-of-fact language to describe a claim made by anti-abortionists. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis that would indicate a strong positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the sentence seems to be straightforwardly reporting a viewpoint held by anti-abortion advocates. it doesn't employ rhetorical devices like hyperbole, irony, or exaggeration that might suggest sarcasm. the language is direct and informative rather than stylized or dramatized.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (neutral reporting) aligns with the true intention (conveying information about a stance). there's no discrepancy between what is said and what is meant that would indicate sarcasm.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

        Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.

BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what?

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative due to the word ""lie"". the phrase ""oft-repeated"" suggests frustration or weariness with hearing the same thing multiple times.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to dismiss or discredit a statement or claim that the speaker believes is false and has been stated many times before. the brevity and directness of the statement suggest genuine frustration rather than playful or ironic sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. there's no apparent contradiction or irony between what is said and what is meant. the statement is brief and direct, lacking the exaggeration or mock enthusiasm often found in sarcastic comments.

based on this analysis, i conclude that the statement is:

### Example:
Input: ""the question is illogical. by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible. see another thread for that topic.   the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature. to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.""

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Prove it. Got any credible scientific or sociological studies? NOPE, ya don't. Didn't think so.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and dismissive. the use of ""prove it"" and ""nope, ya don't"" indicates a challenging tone. the phrase ""didn't think so"" suggests a presumptuous attitude. the all-caps ""nope"" adds emphasis and a sense of finality.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to mock or belittle the person being addressed. the speaker is not genuinely asking for proof or studies; they're implying that no such evidence exists. the rapid-fire sequence of statements (""prove it,"" ""got any...?"", ""nope,"" ""didn't think so"") suggests a rhetorical style meant to shut down discussion rather than encourage it.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a discrepancy between the surface sentiment (which appears to be asking for evidence) and the true intention (which is to mock the lack of evidence). the speaker uses rhetorical questions and immediately answers them, not giving the other person a chance to respond. this style of communication, where the literal meaning differs from the intended meaning, is characteristic of sarcasm.

Input: ""it is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. most protestors on both sides aren't great. one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? you hear ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? no one would admit to this but it is statements like ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. and in that case, i agree...that can be a tough decision.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

step 2: true intention

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step, as the potential for sarcasm requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to mildly negative. the statement is presented matter-of-factly, without obvious emotional keywords or phrases. the phrase ""i fail to see"" suggests some frustration or disagreement, but it's not overtly emotional.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to point out an absurdity or irrelevance in an argument. by equating the subject (likely a pro-life argument about fetal development) to tapeworms, the author is likely trying to ridicule or dismiss the argument as nonsensical. the second sentence reinforces this by explicitly stating the perceived irrelevance to the abortion debate.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the language is superficially neutral, the comparison to tapeworms and the dismissive tone suggest that the author is using sarcasm to mock an argument they disagree with. the juxtaposition of a serious topic (abortion) with something unexpected and unrelated (tapeworms) is a common sarcastic device.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is sarcastic.

        ""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.

step 2: true intention

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.

- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mostly neutral with some hints of frustration or criticism. key phrases like ""are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much..."" suggest a negative tone towards the perceived gap between scientists and laypersons. the text uses rhetorical questions and comparisons to highlight perceived inconsistencies or issues.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing genuine concern and frustration about the communication gap between scientists and laypersons. the author appears to be sincerely questioning why this gap exists and arguing that it should be bridged. the use of rhetorical questions and comparisons (e.g., ""put their pants on one leg at a time"") serves to emphasize the author's point that scientists and laypersons are fundamentally similar and should be able to communicate effectively.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there are elements that could be interpreted as slightly sarcastic (e.g., the rhetorical question about laypersons' intelligence), the overall tone and intention appear to be sincere rather than sarcastic. the author is using rhetorical devices to make a point, but not in a way that contradicts their true meaning. the frustration and criticism expressed seem genuine rather than ironic or mocking.

based on this analysis, i believe the text is not intended to be sarcastic, but rather a sincere expression of concern and criticism about the communication gap between scientists and laypersons.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise or contradiction. the exclamation point adds emphasis, suggesting strong emotion. the use of ""but"" at the beginning indicates a contrast with a previous statement or belief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be questioning or challenging the listener's belief in seti (search for extraterrestrial intelligence). the phrase ""you think"" is used to highlight what the speaker perceives as an inconsistency in the listener's views. the capitalization of seti draws attention to it, potentially implying skepticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a potential discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface appears to be a straightforward statement of surprise, the underlying intention seems to be to point out perceived inconsistency or irony in the listener's beliefs. the exclamation and the structure of the sentence (""but you think..."") are common elements used in sarcastic statements to emphasize contrast or perceived absurdity.

given this analysis, there's a strong possibility that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker appears to be using irony to challenge the listener's belief in seti, likely in contrast with some other belief or statement the listener has made.

        ### Label: 

        ","i will think through this step-by-step, as the text contains some nuanced elements that require careful consideration.

step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be discussing noah's ark from the biblical flood story. it starts with a factual correction about the duration of the flood and the ark's journey. the tone then shifts to a more questioning and skeptical stance, using words like ""pestilent,"" ""biting,"" ""stinging,"" and ""feces and urine infested bilge."" these negative descriptors suggest a critical view of the story's plausibility.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to highlight logical inconsistencies and practical problems with the noah's ark narrative. the author is using rhetorical questions and vivid, unpleasant imagery to challenge the literal interpretation of the story. the final question about aquatic breeders propagating in unsanitary conditions is particularly pointed, implying the impossibility of the situation described in the biblical account.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of factual correction and critical questioning, the true intention is to use these elements to sarcastically undermine the credibility of the noah's ark story. the vivid and unpleasant descriptions, combined with the rhetorical question at the end, create a sarcastic tone that mocks the idea of taking the story literally. the author is not genuinely seeking answers but rather using these questions and descriptions to highlight perceived absurdities in the narrative.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

step 2: true intention
the sentence seems to be straightforwardly reporting a viewpoint held by anti-abortion advocates. it doesn't employ rhetorical devices like hyperbole, irony, or exaggeration that might suggest sarcasm. the language is direct and informative rather than stylized or dramatized.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention

- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis

- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the opening ""bwahahahahhaah!"" suggests mockery or derision
- use of capitalization for emphasis (e.g., ""five times"", ""endanger"", ""else's"")
- strong language and name-calling (""stupid, naive and arrogant"", ""xxxxxx"")
- emotionally charged phrases (""psht"", ""it's easy to get cute"")
- overall tone is aggressive and dismissive of the opposing viewpoint

step 2: true intention
- the author is genuinely expressing strong disagreement with anti-gun advocates
- they're using statistics and hypothetical scenarios to support their pro-gun stance
- the intention is to criticize and discredit anti-gun arguments
- the author is expressing genuine frustration and anger towards those they disagree with

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention
- while the tone is mocking at times, it's not using irony or saying the opposite of what's meant
- the strong language and emphasis serve to reinforce the author's genuine beliefs rather than to create sarcastic contrast
- the ""bwahahahahhaah!"" at the beginning is more of a derisive laugh than sarcastic humor

given this analysis, while the text contains mockery and strong language, it doesn't employ sarcasm in the sense of saying one thing while meaning another. the author's true intentions align with their surface statements.

        ","to accurately classify this text, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning or skeptical. the use of ""humm"" at the beginning suggests contemplation or doubt. the text presents a seeming contradiction between increased gun ownership and decreased crime rates, followed by a rhetorical question challenging the credibility of unspecified studies.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this text appears to be challenging or discrediting studies that likely suggest a correlation between gun ownership and crime rates. the author is using the apparent contradiction between increased gun ownership/concealed carry and decreased crime rates to cast doubt on such studies. the rhetorical question at the end is meant to emphasize this point.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the text starts with a contemplative ""humm,"" which could potentially signal sarcasm, the rest of the content appears to be a straightforward argument against certain studies. the author is using factual claims (whether accurate or not) to make their point, rather than employing typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or irony. the rhetorical question at the end, while somewhat pointed, doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm but rather emphasizes the author's skepticism.

given this analysis, i believe the text is:

i'm confident in this judgment, so i'll explain my reasoning:

the text contains several clear indicators of sarcasm:

1. exaggerated language: ""well, ya know, if you actually, oh i don't know, visited the site"" - this overly dramatic phrasing is typical of sarcastic speech.

2. capitalization for emphasis: ""visited the site"" - this is often used to convey a mocking tone in written sarcasm.

3. condescending tone: the author implies the other person didn't do something obvious (visiting the site), which is a common sarcastic technique.

4. direct mockery: ""but then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist."" - this final statement is clearly intended to insult and mock, using sarcasm to imply that creationists are incapable of basic tasks.

5. contrast between polite phrasing and insulting content: the use of ""ya know"" and ""oh i don't know"" contrasts with the overall insulting message, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these elements combine to create a strongly sarcastic tone throughout the text, making the classification clear.",1

### Example:
Input: ""the anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the statement appears neutral in tone. it uses matter-of-fact language to describe a claim made by anti-abortionists. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis that would indicate a strong positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the sentence seems to be straightforwardly reporting a viewpoint held by anti-abortion advocates. it doesn't employ rhetorical devices like hyperbole, irony, or exaggeration that might suggest sarcasm. the language is direct and informative rather than stylized or dramatized.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (neutral reporting) aligns with the true intention (conveying information about a stance). there's no discrepancy between what is said and what is meant that would indicate sarcasm.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""it is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. most protestors on both sides aren't great. one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? you hear ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? no one would admit to this but it is statements like ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. and in that case, i agree...that can be a tough decision.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely trying to understand and analyze the reasons behind describing abortion as a ""hard decision."" they are examining the logic and motivations behind pro-choice arguments. the questions posed seem to be sincere attempts to understand the perspective, not rhetorical devices meant to ridicule.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention align in this text. there's no significant discrepancy between what is said and what is meant. the author is expressing their thoughts directly and honestly, without employing sarcasm or irony to make their point.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""are you trying to make a point here? or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   one of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. there's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with tv shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   we need massive reform. we gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the text starts with confrontational questions, suggesting frustration or anger.
- uses strong language like ""spewing forth,"" ""crime to discipline,"" ""spoiled rotten.""
- expresses nostalgia for past disciplinary methods and criticism of current approaches.
- concludes with a call for ""massive reform"" and returning to 1950s child-rearing practices.

step 2: true intention
- the author appears genuinely concerned about perceived problems in modern child-rearing.
- they criticize current disciplinary methods, parenting practices, and societal issues.
- the tone is direct and argumentative, without subtle irony or contradiction.
- the call for reform seems sincere, aligning with the overall sentiment of the text.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention align consistently throughout the text.
- there's no discernible gap between what is said and what is meant.
- the language, while passionate and somewhat exaggerated, does not employ irony or sarcasm.
- the author's views, while potentially controversial, appear to be expressed earnestly.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""said the troll that lives in the uk""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no overtly positive or negative words, emojis, or sentimental phrases. the statement is matter-of-fact in tone.

step 2: true intention
the statement seems to be a straightforward description or attribution of a quote to someone characterized as a ""troll"" who lives in the uk. while calling someone a ""troll"" can be negative, the overall intention appears to be simply identifying the source of a previous statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or mock enthusiasm. it's a direct attribution that doesn't seem to hide any deeper meaning or contradiction.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""they aren't afraid of that. that a government agency would actually be financially competitive is ridiculous. the only way it could compete for customers would be by running at an enormous loss or legislating away competition. that's what people are ""afraid"" of, not some idiotic speculation that government is great at business.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- negative tone towards government agencies' competitiveness
- use of strong words like ""ridiculous"" and ""idiotic""
- quotation marks around ""afraid"" suggest skepticism

step 2: true intention
- the author is directly stating their opinion
- they argue that government agencies cannot be financially competitive
- the author explains why people are concerned about government competition

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention
- there's no contradiction between what's said and what's meant

the text is a lengthy, passionate critique of al gore and his stance on climate change. while the tone is highly critical and at times mocking, it does not employ sarcasm as its primary rhetorical device. instead, it presents a series of direct accusations, counterarguments, and alleged factual rebuttals to gore's claims.

the author's intentions appear to be genuinely expressing disagreement and attempting to discredit gore's position on climate change. the language is straightforward in its criticism, using terms like ""shyster"" and ""hypocrite"" directly rather than through ironic or sarcastic means.

while there are elements of ridicule and strong disagreement throughout the text, these are expressed openly rather than through sarcastic inversion of meaning. the author is being blunt and confrontational in their criticism, not employing subtle sarcasm to make their point.",0

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the text uses questioning language, suggesting confusion or skepticism
- there's a tone of challenge in phrases like ""why mention them if you aren't going to explain them?""
- the statement ""you are actually on a board of education?"" implies disbelief or criticism
- the comparison between evolution and gravity theories seems to be making a point about scientific validity

step 2: true intention
- the speaker appears to be criticizing someone's approach to education, particularly regarding the teaching of scientific theories
- there's an implication that the person being addressed is not presenting a balanced or complete view of scientific theories
- the mention of gravity seems to be used as a rhetorical device to highlight perceived inconsistencies in how different scientific theories are treated
- the final statement about evolution being more secure than gravity is likely meant to emphasize the strength of evolutionary theory, contrary to how it might be presented in some educational contexts

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and critical, the true intention aligns with this
- the use of rhetorical questions and comparisons serves to emphasize the speaker's point rather than to convey an opposite meaning
- there's no clear discrepancy between the literal meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm
- the tone is direct and confrontational rather than employing the indirect or ironic approach typical of sarcasm

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears informative and analytical on the surface. it discusses the history and evolution of ideas around natural selection and creationism. there are no overtly sarcastic keywords or phrases, and the tone seems academic and explanatory.

step 2: true intention
the author is presenting a critique of anti-evolutionist arguments, particularly focusing on how they've adapted their views over time. the phrase ""suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science"" suggests the author finds this shift inconsistent or opportunistic. the use of quotation marks around ""micro-evolve"" indicates skepticism about this concept as used by anti-evolutionists.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface tone is informative, there's an underlying critical stance towards anti-evolutionist arguments. the author points out what they see as inconsistencies in the anti-evolutionist position, particularly in the final sentence. however, this criticism is presented through logical argumentation rather than overt sarcasm. the author's skepticism is conveyed through the content of their arguments rather than through sarcastic language or tone.

given this analysis, i believe the text is best classified as:

not sarcastic

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely trying to understand and analyze the reasons behind describing abortion as a ""hard decision."" they are examining the logic and motivations behind pro-choice arguments. the questions posed seem to be sincere attempts to understand the perspective, not rhetorical devices meant to ridicule.

- there's no discernible gap between what is said and what is meant.
- the language, while passionate and somewhat exaggerated, does not employ irony or sarcasm.
- the author's views, while potentially controversial, appear to be expressed earnestly.

        You are getting to a more complicated area where ""mental existence"" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as ""self defense"" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and eager. phrases like ""now we're getting somewhere"" and ""explain more, please"" suggest enthusiasm and interest. the ""oh, and..."" addition seems to politely request more information.

step 2: true intention
looking closer, there are signs of potential sarcasm:
- ""oh, now we're getting somewhere"" could be read as insincere or mocking, implying the opposite - that little progress has been made.
- the request to ""explain more, please"" might be a sarcastic way of saying the explanation so far has been inadequate.
- ""oh, and..."" casually tacking on a request for evidence could be seen as a pointed jab, implying such evidence is lacking.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a noticeable gap between the surface enthusiasm and the likely true intention. the polite phrasing masks what seems to be frustration or skepticism. the casual requests for more explanation and evidence appear to be rhetorical devices highlighting perceived deficiencies in the argument being addressed.

given this analysis, i believe this text is sarcastic. the seemingly positive surface sentiment contrasts with an underlying critical or skeptical intention, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be informative and slightly critical. the author presents what they call an ""interesting tid bit"" and directs the reader to an article. they point out an apparent contradiction in a senator's stance on gun control. the phrase ""i got an interesting tid bit for you"" suggests a neutral to positive tone of sharing information.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to highlight hypocrisy and criticize the senator's stance on gun control. the author points out that the anti-gun senator has the ""only legal concealed gun in the city of san francisco,"" implying a contradiction between the senator's public stance and personal actions. the author also critiques the senator's gun handling, suggesting she should ""keep your finger off the trigger,"" which implies the senator is not following proper gun safety protocols.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears informative, the true intention is to criticize and point out hypocrisy. however, this criticism is presented in a straightforward manner rather than using typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or mock enthusiasm. the author directly states their points and observations without employing sarcastic language or tone.

based on this analysis, while the text is critical, it does not appear to be sarcastic.

        ### Input:
        They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost. If you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya gotta do is inject miracles into the field. 

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be mostly neutral and explanatory in the first part. however, phrases like ""i mean come on"" and ""all ya gotta do"" introduce a more casual, potentially dismissive tone. the latter part of the text seems to criticize the idea of incorporating miracles into science, suggesting that doing so would make science ""arbitrary and unreliable.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to argue against the incorporation of supernatural or miraculous explanations in scientific fields, particularly physics. the author is using rhetorical questions and exaggeration to emphasize their point. the casual language and somewhat hyperbolic statements (e.g., ""nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost"") are used to ridicule the idea of mixing science with supernatural explanations.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment starts neutral, it shifts to a more critical and dismissive tone. this aligns with the true intention of arguing against supernatural explanations in science. however, the use of exaggeration and casual language (""i mean come on"", ""all ya gotta do"") suggests a sarcastic undertone. the author is not sincerely suggesting that miracles should be incorporated into science; rather, they're using sarcasm to highlight the perceived absurdity of such an idea.

given this analysis, i believe the text contains elements of sarcasm, particularly in the latter half where the author exaggerates the consequences of incorporating miracles into science to make their point.

### Example:
Input: ""the anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the statement appears neutral in tone. it uses matter-of-fact language to describe a claim made by anti-abortionists. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis that would indicate a strong positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the sentence seems to be straightforwardly reporting a viewpoint held by anti-abortion advocates. it doesn't employ rhetorical devices like hyperbole, irony, or exaggeration that might suggest sarcasm. the language is direct and informative rather than stylized or dramatized.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (neutral reporting) aligns with the true intention (conveying information about a stance). there's no discrepancy between what is said and what is meant that would indicate sarcasm.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""they aren't afraid of that. that a government agency would actually be financially competitive is ridiculous. the only way it could compete for customers would be by running at an enormous loss or legislating away competition. that's what people are ""afraid"" of, not some idiotic speculation that government is great at business.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- negative tone towards government agencies' competitiveness
- use of strong words like ""ridiculous"" and ""idiotic""
- quotation marks around ""afraid"" suggest skepticism

step 2: true intention
- the author is directly stating their opinion
- they argue that government agencies cannot be financially competitive
- the author explains why people are concerned about government competition

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention
- there's no contradiction between what's said and what's meant
- the use of quotation marks around ""afraid"" emphasizes the author's point rather than indicating sarcasm

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

the surface sentiment is strongly pro-gun rights and pro-voting rights. key phrases like ""i will not give up my right to vote"" and ""i will not give up my firearms"" indicate a passionate stance. the tone is serious and assertive throughout.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. the author is making a genuine argument for gun ownership rights, drawing parallels with voting rights and citing examples from around the world. there are no apparent rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that suggest an underlying sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are consistent. the author maintains a serious tone throughout, presenting their arguments in a straightforward manner without any noticeable irony or sarcasm. the examples and analogies used (e.g., comparing gun rights to voting rights, mentioning other countries) are presented as sincere supporting evidence for their stance.

the true intention seems to be pointing out an irony or contradiction. the author is highlighting that someone (supersport) who is described as dishonest is paradoxically more honest than others (marc or aa) in admitting the limitations of their beliefs. this juxtaposition of honesty and dishonesty suggests a subtle criticism of all parties involved.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface appears to be a straightforward comparison, the underlying message is more complex. the author is using irony to make a point about the relative honesty of different individuals in a debate context. this ironic contrast between ""dishonesty"" and being ""more honest"" is a classic indicator of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems somewhat neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""till your ears bleed"" is a strong, potentially negative expression, but there are no other overtly emotional words or phrases. the tone is matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing frustration or criticism of the lengthy appeals process in death penalty cases. the exaggeration ""till your ears bleed"" suggests the author finds the process excessively long and tiresome. there's a subtle implication that the death penalty might not be as final or swift as some might think.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the true intention carries a hint of criticism or frustration. the use of hyperbole (""till your ears bleed"") introduces a slight mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended message. this exaggeration could be interpreted as a mild form of sarcasm, used to emphasize the author's point about the drawn-out nature of death penalty appeals.

given this analysis, while there are elements that could be interpreted as mildly sarcastic, the overall tone and intention seem more straightforward than deeply sarcastic. the hyperbole serves more as emphasis than as a reversal of meaning typical of strong sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. the author is making a genuine argument for gun ownership rights, drawing parallels with voting rights and citing examples from around the world. there are no apparent rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that suggest an underlying sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly confident. the phrase ""as is obvious"" suggests certainty or clarity about the statement that follows.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to challenge or contradict an unstated assumption. by saying ""not all would,"" the speaker is implying that there's a diversity of opinions or actions, contrary to what might have been suggested or assumed.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle mismatch between the confident opening ""as is obvious"" and the less definitive ""not all would."" this contradiction suggests a sarcastic tone. the speaker is likely using the phrase ""as is obvious"" ironically to highlight that the following statement is actually not obvious or universally accepted.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is sarcastic.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears frustrated and critical. key phrases like ""steering away from the debate,"" ""ignoring the debate,"" ""making this same mistake,"" and ""i doubt you have any reason to believe"" indicate a confrontational tone. the text challenges the other person's arguments and interpretations.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns closely with the surface sentiment. the author is genuinely criticizing the other person's argumentation style and interpretation of biblical texts. they accuse the other person of avoiding the main debate, making up stories to cover perceived flaws in the bible, and basing arguments on personal views rather than facts. the criticism is direct and meant to be taken at face value.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the text is straightforward in its criticism and doesn't employ irony or exaggeration typical of sarcasm. while the tone is confrontational and somewhat mocking at times (e.g., ""i'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong""), it doesn't rise to the level of sarcasm. the author is directly expressing their disagreement and frustration with the other person's arguments.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be explanatory and somewhat philosophical. the use of quotation marks around words like ""where"", ""sit"", ""always"", ""eternity"", and ""time"" suggests a questioning or uncertain tone. the addition of ""maybe"" at the end further emphasizes uncertainty.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to point out the absurdity or paradoxical nature of discussing concepts like time and space before the big bang. the author is using complex scientific and philosophical concepts to highlight the limitations of human understanding and language when discussing the origins of the universe.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears explanatory, the true intention seems to be to highlight the inherent contradictions in discussing pre-big bang concepts. the use of quotation marks and the final ""maybe"" suggest a subtle mockery of attempts to apply temporal and spatial concepts to a state where they might not apply. this subtle contradiction between the explanatory tone and the implied absurdity of the concept being explained hints at sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a seemingly explanatory tone to subtly mock the idea of discussing pre-big bang concepts using our current understanding of time and space, making it sarcastic in nature.",1

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears factual and slightly critical. the text discusses cranial capacity comparisons between homo erectus and modern humans. the phrase ""bizarre positions you decide other people should hold"" has a negative tone, suggesting disagreement or criticism.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to refute or criticize someone else's argument or interpretation. the author is pointing out that comparing homo erectus to a 10-13 year old boy would show a significant difference in cranial capacity. they then assert that this doesn't contradict other information, implying that the person they're responding to has misinterpreted or misrepresented something.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a hint of criticism in the language, particularly in the last sentence, the overall tone is more straightforward and argumentative rather than sarcastic. the author is directly challenging someone's interpretation without using irony or exaggeration typical of sarcasm. the criticism is explicit rather than implied through sarcasm.

        ","i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears casual and matter-of-fact. the phrase ""just a"" implies simplicity or ordinariness. ""it happens"" is a common phrase used to indicate that something is normal or not unusual. there are no strong emotional keywords or emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be conveying irony or sarcasm. the phrase ""newly-evolved structure"" suggests something complex and rare, which contradicts the casual tone of ""just a"" and ""it happens."" evolution typically takes a very long time, so describing a ""newly-evolved structure"" as something that ""just happens"" is likely meant to be humorous or sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the casual, nonchalant surface sentiment and the improbability of what's being described. the juxtaposition of treating a significant evolutionary event as mundane is a classic sarcastic technique. the speaker is likely using understatement to highlight the absurdity or unlikelihood of the situation they're referring to.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

### label: sarcastic",1
"If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified. The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles. No elective, invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge.   If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents/ guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise, they wouldn't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition.",0,"
### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""are you trying to make a point here? or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   one of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. there's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with tv shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   we need massive reform. we gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the text starts with confrontational questions, suggesting frustration or anger.
- uses strong language like ""spewing forth,"" ""crime to discipline,"" ""spoiled rotten.""
- expresses nostalgia for past disciplinary methods and criticism of current approaches.
- concludes with a call for ""massive reform"" and returning to 1950s child-rearing practices.

step 2: true intention
- the author appears genuinely concerned about perceived problems in modern child-rearing.
- they criticize current disciplinary methods, parenting practices, and societal issues.
- the tone is direct and argumentative, without subtle irony or contradiction.
- the call for reform seems sincere, aligning with the overall sentiment of the text.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention align consistently throughout the text.
- there's no discernible gap between what is said and what is meant.
- the language, while passionate and somewhat exaggerated, does not employ irony or sarcasm.
- the author's views, while potentially controversial, appear to be expressed earnestly.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""the anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the statement appears neutral in tone. it uses matter-of-fact language to describe a claim made by anti-abortionists. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis that would indicate a strong positive or negative sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the sentence seems to be straightforwardly reporting a viewpoint held by anti-abortion advocates. it doesn't employ rhetorical devices like hyperbole, irony, or exaggeration that might suggest sarcasm. the language is direct and informative rather than stylized or dramatized.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (neutral reporting) aligns with the true intention (conveying information about a stance). there's no discrepancy between what is said and what is meant that would indicate sarcasm.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""it is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. most protestors on both sides aren't great. one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? you hear ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? no one would admit to this but it is statements like ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. and in that case, i agree...that can be a tough decision.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely trying to understand and analyze the reasons behind describing abortion as a ""hard decision."" they are examining the logic and motivations behind pro-choice arguments. the questions posed seem to be sincere attempts to understand the perspective, not rhetorical devices meant to ridicule.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention align in this text. there's no significant discrepancy between what is said and what is meant. the author is expressing their thoughts directly and honestly, without employing sarcasm or irony to make their point.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is strongly pro-gun rights and pro-voting rights. key phrases like ""i will not give up my right to vote"" and ""i will not give up my firearms"" indicate a passionate stance. the tone is serious and assertive throughout.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. the author is making a genuine argument for gun ownership rights, drawing parallels with voting rights and citing examples from around the world. there are no apparent rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that suggest an underlying sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are consistent. the author maintains a serious tone throughout, presenting their arguments in a straightforward manner without any noticeable irony or sarcasm. the examples and analogies used (e.g., comparing gun rights to voting rights, mentioning other countries) are presented as sincere supporting evidence for their stance.

- the comparison to ""military intelligence"" implies criticism.
- ""secondly, as i stated before..."" suggests a continuation of a previous argument.
- overall, the surface sentiment appears critical and slightly confrontational.

step 2: true intention
- the author is criticizing the pairing of ""great"" and ""evangelist,"" implying that these terms are contradictory.
- the comparison to ""military intelligence"" is likely intended as a joke or criticism, suggesting that both pairs of words are contradictory.
- the author is pointing out perceived flaws in the other person's argument or presentation.
- there's an implication that the other person has left important information out (""left too many other questions unanswered"").

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention in being critical.
- however, the use of the ""military intelligence"" comparison introduces a sarcastic element.

not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""the question is illogical. by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible. see another thread for that topic.   the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature. to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.""

Steps:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears dismissive and confrontational. the use of ""uh. no they didn't."" indicates disagreement and possibly frustration. the follow-up question ""have you ever actually taken a biology course?"" suggests skepticism about the other person's knowledge or qualifications.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to challenge and discredit the previous statement or claim made by someone else. the rhetorical question about taking a biology course is likely meant to imply that the other person lacks basic knowledge in the subject, thus undermining their credibility.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the tone is confrontational and somewhat condescending, there isn't a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention that would indicate sarcasm. the statement is direct in its disagreement and questioning of the other person's knowledge. it doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or mock agreement.

based on this analysis, i would classify this as:

not sarcastic

the statement is confrontational and possibly rude, but it appears to be a straightforward expression of disagreement and skepticism rather than employing sarcasm.",0

Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort.

"believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless",0,"

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.

        believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical or accusatory. the phrase ""by removing you mean killing the innocent of course"" suggests a strong disagreement with someone's use of the term ""removing"". the author is explicitly stating that this is equivalent to killing innocent people, which carries a very negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to highlight the severity and moral implications of what someone else has referred to as ""removing"". the author is drawing a sharp contrast between ""killing the innocent"" and ""imprisonment of the criminal"", emphasizing that these are fundamentally different acts. the use of ""of course"" suggests that the author believes this distinction should be obvious.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the tone is critical and the language is pointed, there doesn't appear to be a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the author is directly expressing their view without employing irony or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm. the statement is meant to be taken at face value as a serious critique of terminology that the author feels minimizes the gravity of the action being discussed.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

label: not sarcastic

Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely.

step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

        It depends on the particular situation. Some adoption agencies ask about it, and some don't. Most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions. Some adoptive gay parents are out about it, and some keep it quiet.   There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, ""I am not homosexual."" Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely. They have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents. In the case of a couple, their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt. No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans.

### Example:

        ","let's analyze this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the text appears to be a polite request for information.
- the phrase ""it's nice to feel special"" seems positive on the surface.
- the overall tone is inquisitive and seemingly cooperative.

step 2: true intention
- the author is questioning the credibility of a claim about carl burgh's fraudulent activities.
- the parenthetical comment ""(ps i note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book! it's nice to feel special)"" implies a subtle criticism of inconsistent treatment.
- the request for citations and additional information suggests skepticism about the original claim.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface tone is polite and inquisitive, there's a subtle undercurrent of skepticism and criticism.
- the phrase ""it's nice to feel special"" is likely meant ironically, pointing out perceived inconsistency in how information is shared.
- the overall message is more complex than it initially appears, with a mix of genuine inquiry and subtle sarcasm.

given this analysis, i would classify this as:

sarcastic

the sarcasm is subtle and localized to the parenthetical comment, but it's present enough to influence the overall tone of the message.",1

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.

- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly questioning. the use of ""obviously"" and ""that's obvious"" could be read as straightforward statements or potentially as exaggeration. there are no strong emotional keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be questioning or challenging an assumption about the red cross's christian identity. the repetition of ""obvious"" and ""christian"" appears to be emphasizing a point, possibly with a hint of irony. the structure of posing a question and then immediately answering it with ""obviously"" could be interpreted as a rhetorical device to highlight the speaker's skepticism.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears neutral, the true intention seems to carry a subtle tone of skepticism or criticism. the repetition and structure suggest the speaker might be using mild sarcasm to question the assumption that the red cross is inherently christian just because most americans are christian. however, the sarcasm, if present, is quite subtle and not overtly apparent.

given this analysis, i'm leaning towards classifying this as mildly sarcastic, but it's a close call. the sarcasm is not blatant, and the statement could be read as sincere by some readers.

### Example:
Input: ""it is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. most protestors on both sides aren't great. one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? you hear ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? no one would admit to this but it is statements like ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. and in that case, i agree...that can be a tough decision.""

Input: ""the question is illogical. by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible. see another thread for that topic.   the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature. to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely attempting to explain a logical fallacy in the reasoning about god's nature and omnipotence. the intention is to provide a thoughtful, rational critique of the original question.

step 3: comparison and analysis

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have.

- the speaker appears to be directly stating that their previous post (comment or message) was providing evidence or support for something.
- the language is straightforward and lacks any rhetorical devices or stylistic elements that might suggest hidden meaning.
- the tone seems matter-of-fact and sincere.

step 3: comparison and analysis

- there's no discrepancy between what is said and what is meant.
- the statement lacks typical sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""the question is illogical. by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible. see another thread for that topic.   the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature. to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely attempting to explain a logical fallacy in the reasoning about god's nature and omnipotence. the intention is to provide a thoughtful, rational critique of the original question.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention align. there are no contradictions between the literal meaning and the intended message. the text lacks typical sarcastic elements like irony, exaggeration, or mock enthusiasm.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""are you trying to make a point here? or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   one of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. there's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with tv shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   we need massive reform. we gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the text starts with confrontational questions, suggesting frustration or anger.
- uses strong language like ""spewing forth,"" ""crime to discipline,"" ""spoiled rotten.""
- expresses nostalgia for past disciplinary methods and criticism of current approaches.
- concludes with a call for ""massive reform"" and returning to 1950s child-rearing practices.

step 2: true intention
- the author appears genuinely concerned about perceived problems in modern child-rearing.
- they criticize current disciplinary methods, parenting practices, and societal issues.
- the tone is direct and argumentative, without subtle irony or contradiction.
- the call for reform seems sincere, aligning with the overall sentiment of the text.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention align consistently throughout the text.
- there's no discernible gap between what is said and what is meant.
- the language, while passionate and somewhat exaggerated, does not employ irony or sarcasm.
- the author's views, while potentially controversial, appear to be expressed earnestly.

        ### Input:
        So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy.

this lengthy text appears to be a sincere and earnest account of personal religious experiences and beliefs. the author describes several events they interpret as miraculous or divine interventions, including healing prayers, angelic encounters, and supernatural protection. the tone throughout is serious, passionate, and deeply conviction-driven, without any indicators of irony, mockery, or sarcasm.

the author uses rhetorical questions not to mock, but to engage in a thoughtful discussion about the nature of faith and miracles. they openly acknowledge the difficulty non-believers might have in accepting such accounts, which shows a level of self-awareness inconsistent with sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears strongly negative and dismissive. key phrases like ""no idea"", ""makes no sense"", ""so vague"", and ""worthless"" all convey a very critical and frustrated tone. the language is emphatic, using absolutes like ""no"" and ""so"" to underscore the perceived lack of meaning or value.

step 2: true intention

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is quite negative and critical. key phrases like ""failing miserably"" and ""definition... is asinine"" express strong disapproval. the tone is confrontational and dismissive of the addressee's viewpoint.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. the speaker is directly criticizing the addressee's understanding or definition of atheism, suggesting it's so poor that even those who might be expected to agree (christians) would likely disagree. the language is direct and doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement is a straightforward criticism without any indicators of sarcasm such as mock praise, exaggerated agreement, or ironic contrast. the harsh language is meant to be taken at face value as a direct challenge to the addressee's position.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

label: not sarcastic

the statement, while harsh and critical, is expressing its intended meaning directly without employing sarcasm.",0

        ","i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears factual and analytical. the text uses statistical figures and comparative language, presenting information about gun usage. the opening word ""really"" could potentially indicate skepticism, but overall the tone seems informative rather than overtly emotional.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be making an argument in favor of gun rights by presenting statistics about defensive and legal gun uses. the author is trying to demonstrate that legal gun uses far outweigh illegal uses. the mention of ""b becomes pretty insignificant"" suggests the author is countering a previous point about illegal gun use.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the opening ""really"" could be read as slightly sarcastic, the rest of the text maintains a factual tone. the author is presenting an argument using statistics and comparisons, which is more consistent with sincere argumentation than sarcasm. there's no clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention that would indicate sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i believe the text is not sarcastic. the author appears to be making a genuine argument using statistics and comparisons.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

        ","let's analyze this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the opening question ""oh, he doesn't want abortion, huh?"" suggests skepticism or challenge.
- the accusation of lying (""you just lied here"") indicates a confrontational tone.
- the invitation ""let's look, shall we?"" has a somewhat dramatic or theatrical feel.

step 2: true intention
- the speaker is challenging a claim about abortion and the old testament.
- they're implying that the old testament actually supports abortion, contrary to what someone has claimed.
- the rhetorical question and invitation to ""look"" suggest the speaker is about to present evidence to support their point.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a mismatch between the surface sentiment (which appears to be simply questioning) and the true intention (which is to challenge and disprove a claim).
- the use of ""oh"" and ""huh?"" in the opening question is a classic sarcastic device, expressing mock surprise or disbelief.
- the theatrical ""let's look, shall we?"" is another sarcastic element, dramatically setting up the counterargument.
- the accusation of lying is direct, but the overall tone and structure of the message suggest sarcasm rather than just straightforward disagreement.

step 3: comparison and analysis

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        I'm not surprised.   That's a typical response when someone calls your bluff.   Waxy

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. key phrases:
- ""i'm not surprised"" - could indicate disappointment or resignation
- ""that's a typical response"" - suggests a pattern of behavior, potentially negative
- ""when someone calls your bluff"" - implies confrontation or exposing deception
the tone seems matter-of-fact, without strong emotional indicators.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism or mockery. the author is:
- implying the other person is being predictable in their behavior
- suggesting the other person is bluffing (being dishonest or exaggerating)
- using ""waxy"" at the end, which could be a dismissive nickname or sign-off
the overall message appears to be calling out perceived dishonesty or weakness in the other person's argument or behavior.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a discrepancy between the relatively neutral surface sentiment and the more critical true intention. the author is using understatement (""i'm not surprised"") and seemingly casual observations to deliver a more biting critique. this mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended message is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

        ","i believe this text requires a more careful analysis, so i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears enthusiastic and supportive of open gun carry. it uses phrases like ""if you got it - flaunt it"" and talks positively about ""pretty, fashionable gun rigs"" and job creation. the tone seems light-hearted, with jokes about dating and fashion.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be satirical or sarcastic. the exaggerated scenarios (like gun rigs becoming fashion statements or corner gun stores) and the casual tone when discussing a controversial topic suggest the author is not sincerely advocating for these ideas. the comparison to ""scantily clad women"" and the dismissive reference to ""brady cowards"" further indicate a mocking tone towards gun control advocates.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a significant discrepancy between the surface enthusiasm and the likely true intention. the exaggerated scenarios and casual treatment of a serious topic are classic indicators of sarcasm. the author appears to be using humor and hyperbole to criticize arguments for open carry laws, rather than genuinely supporting them.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step, as the text contains some nuanced language that requires careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be cautionary and somewhat critical. key phrases like ""be wary of names"" and ""evolutionaries are putting too much faith in names of words"" suggest a skeptical or questioning tone towards scientific terminology. the use of quotation marks around terms like 'junk' dna and 'transitional' fossil implies doubt or criticism of these labels.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to challenge or criticize the naming conventions and interpretations in evolutionary biology. the author is using analogies (like blank spaces in text) to argue that seemingly unimportant elements may have crucial functions. they're suggesting that scientists might be misinterpreting or oversimplifying biological concepts based on potentially misleading names or terminology.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is cautionary and critical, it aligns closely with the true intention of the text. the author is directly expressing their viewpoint without employing irony or saying the opposite of what they mean. the analogies and examples are used to support their argument rather than to mock or satirize. there's no significant discrepancy between the literal meaning and the intended meaning that would indicate sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""just the pork"" could be interpreted as dismissive. there are no overtly emotional words or phrases, and no emojis or exclamation marks to indicate strong sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be critical or disapproving. the use of ""pork"" here is likely referring to ""pork barrel spending"" - a political term for government spending on localized projects to bring money to a representative's district. by saying it's ""tacked onto the original bill,"" the speaker implies this additional spending was unnecessary or inappropriately added.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle mismatch between the relatively neutral surface tone and the more critical underlying meaning. the use of ""just"" minimizes the addition, while ""pork"" carries negative connotations in this context. this discrepancy, combined with the casual, matter-of-fact delivery of what is actually a criticism, suggests a sarcastic tone.

label: sarcastic

the statement uses understatement and political jargon to convey disapproval in a way that's more biting than a direct criticism would be, which is characteristic of sarcasm.",1

"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.",0,"

        ### Input:
        You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.

### Example:
Input: ""are you trying to make a point here? or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   one of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. there's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with tv shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   we need massive reform. we gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.""

Steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is strongly pro-gun rights and pro-voting rights. key phrases like ""i will not give up my right to vote"" and ""i will not give up my firearms"" indicate a passionate stance. the tone is serious and assertive throughout.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment. the author is making a genuine argument for gun ownership rights, drawing parallels with voting rights and citing examples from around the world. there are no apparent rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that suggest an underlying sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are consistent. the author maintains a serious tone throughout, presenting their arguments in a straightforward manner without any noticeable irony or sarcasm. the examples and analogies used (e.g., comparing gun rights to voting rights, mentioning other countries) are presented as sincere supporting evidence for their stance.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

Input: ""the question is illogical. by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible. see another thread for that topic.   the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature. to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely attempting to explain a logical fallacy in the reasoning about god's nature and omnipotence. the intention is to provide a thoughtful, rational critique of the original question.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the sarcasm here is subtle:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems contemplative and slightly frustrated. the phrase ""struck a chord with me"" indicates emotional resonance. the use of quotation marks and ""!?"" suggests some skepticism or exasperation with the quoted viewpoints. the overall tone seems to be one of realization or insight.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be highlighting the irony in how people from opposing sides claim to have factual support, while the speaker believes the real issue lies in emotional reactions rather than facts. the author seems to be critiquing the tendency of people to claim objectivity while actually being driven by subjective responses.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there's a slight mismatch between the surface sentiment (which seems more straightforward) and the deeper intention (which carries a hint of criticism), this doesn't quite rise to the level of sarcasm. the author is making a genuine observation about human behavior, using a touch of irony to emphasize their point. however, the statement lacks the hallmark exaggeration or mock enthusiasm typically associated with sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i would classify this as:

not sarcastic

the statement contains irony and critique, but it's presented as a sincere observation rather than a sarcastic comment.",0
"Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic.",0,"
### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""i'm glad to see you've finally come around.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive, with the phrase ""i'm glad"" indicating happiness or satisfaction. the word ""finally"" suggests a sense of relief or accomplishment after a period of waiting or disagreement.

step 2: true intention
there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement. the language is straightforward and doesn't employ exaggeration or contradiction. the phrase ""come around"" implies a genuine change of opinion or agreement after previous disagreement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the likely true intention of the speaker. there's no discrepancy between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which is typically present in sarcastic statements.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and dismissive. the use of ""oh, so"" at the beginning suggests skepticism. the phrase ""please, that's just pathetic"" at the end conveys a strong negative sentiment and criticism.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to call out perceived dishonesty or inconsistency in the other person's statements. the rhetorical question ""then why are they posted on the c vs e board?"" implies that the author doesn't believe the other person's claim. the final statement ""please, that's just pathetic"" reinforces the author's disbelief and contempt for the other person's apparent attempt to deny discussing evolution.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface sentiment appears to be asking for clarification (""oh, so you were not...?""), the true intention is to express disbelief and criticism. the use of feigned politeness (""oh, so"") followed by a direct accusation of dishonesty and the dismissive ""please, that's just pathetic"" are classic markers of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""it is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. most protestors on both sides aren't great. one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? you hear ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? no one would admit to this but it is statements like ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. and in that case, i agree...that can be a tough decision.""

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and negative. key phrases like ""further political aspirations"" and ""making law instead of interpreting it"" suggest disapproval. the use of multiple ellipses (...) adds a dramatic or skeptical tone. the reference to ""sodom (sf)"" is derogatory.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism of both the politician in question and the 9th circuit court. the author is implying that the politician's actions are motivated by career ambitions rather than proper governance. the court is accused of judicial activism and incompetence (""that is why they are over ruled so often""). the use of ""sodom"" to refer to san francisco is a deliberate insult, associating the city with biblical immorality.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns closely with the true intention. the criticism is direct and unambiguous, without any reversal of meaning or irony that would indicate sarcasm. while the tone is mocking and derisive, it doesn't employ sarcasm as a rhetorical device. the author is expressing their negative opinions straightforwardly, albeit in a provocative manner.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the context is limited and sarcasm can be subtle:

step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""certainly it does"" appears positive and affirming on the surface. the word ""certainly"" conveys confidence and agreement.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning. the statement could be genuinely agreeing with something, or it could potentially be an exaggerated agreement used sarcastically to imply the opposite.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information, there's no clear evidence of sarcasm. the surface sentiment aligns with a straightforward, agreeing intention. while sarcasm is possible, there are no obvious contradictions or cues that would strongly suggest it.

based on this analysis, and erring on the side of caution without more context, i would classify this as:

        You may see a vast differene, many do not. The ""moral"" grounds for many is simply the justification for their homophobia.   So now it's a massive nation wide government conspiracy to stifle free speech?   Canada stifles and oppresses religious freedom?   Honestly Jyoshu, where do you get this stuff?   This is utter BS, if you can find ANY proof of the Canadian gov't stifling free speech on this issue, religious freedom, or any other issue for that matter, please post it. If not, retract your BS statement, and admit that it's a fabrication.   I honestly don't think I underestimate it at all. I come across a very broad spectrum of people in my line of work, from one end of the scale to the other. The most common negative response I get is from those that are opposed to homosexuality in general and respond along the lines of ""I don't like, I don't want to see it, but rights are rights, as long as it doesn't negatively affect me, I don't have a problem with it/I don't really care."" I have come across a couple of people who were strongly opposed to the use of the term ""marriage"" but were fine with allowing homosexual ""civil unions"".   I think you overestimate how big of a ""moral issue"" this really is for most people.   Waxy

        ","i will analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confident and assertive. key phrases like ""have proven you...to be utterly wrong"" and ""the fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant"" suggest a strong, dismissive tone towards the addressee's position.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to align with the surface sentiment. the author is directly stating that other commenters have disproven the addressee's argument, and is dismissing any potential counterargument by stating that the addressee's recognition (or lack thereof) is irrelevant. there's no apparent hidden meaning or irony.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to be in alignment. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, mock enthusiasm, or incongruity between the literal words and the intended meaning. the statement, while confrontational, seems to be a straightforward expression of disagreement and dismissal.

based on this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the intended meaning isn't immediately clear:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. the statement ""and here our government says: rights and responsibilities"" is a simple declaration without obvious emotional keywords or phrases. there are no emojis or strong sentiment indicators.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is harder to discern without more context. the phrase ""and here our government says"" could be interpreted as introducing a contrast or comparison to something mentioned previously. the mention of ""rights and responsibilities"" seems to be quoting or paraphrasing an official government stance. however, the brevity and lack of further commentary make it difficult to determine if there's an underlying critique or sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information and lack of clear sarcastic indicators (such as exaggeration, irony, or contradictory elements), it's difficult to confidently label this as sarcastic. the statement could be a straightforward reference to government policy, or it could be subtly implying criticism depending on the broader context. without more context, the safest interpretation is to take the statement at face value.

based on this analysis, and erring on the side of caution due to lack of clear sarcastic markers, i would classify this as:

label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that this classification has a lower confidence level due to the brevity of the statement and lack of context. in a broader conversation, it's possible this could be part of a sarcastic comment, but based solely on the given text, there's insufficient evidence to label it as sarcastic.",0

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be quoting a biblical passage from the gospel of mark, followed by a question ""are they mistakenly reading this?"" the surface sentiment seems neutral when quoting the biblical text, but the final question suggests some doubt or skepticism.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be questioning the literal interpretation of this biblical passage. by highlighting some of the more extraordinary claims in the text (like handling snakes and drinking poison without harm), and then asking if it's being mistakenly read, the author seems to be implying that a literal interpretation of this passage is problematic or unrealistic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is mostly neutral due to the biblical quotation, the true intention appears to be questioning or critiquing a literal interpretation of the text. the final question ""are they mistakenly reading this?"" is likely rhetorical, implying that the author believes such a literal reading is indeed mistaken. this subtle contradiction between the seemingly straightforward quotation and the implied criticism in the question suggests a sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, i believe the text is intended to be sarcastic, subtly critiquing literal interpretations of biblical texts.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no emotional keywords, emotive phrases, or emojis. the statement ""because most people are christian"" is presented as a straightforward factual claim without any obvious positive or negative connotations.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden intention beyond the surface meaning. the statement could be:
- a simple explanation for something (genuine)
- a dismissive response to a question or situation (potentially sarcastic)
- an oversimplification of a complex issue (potentially sarcastic)

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the brevity of the statement and lack of context, there's not enough information to confidently detect sarcasm. the surface meaning and potential true intentions don't clearly align or misalign. without additional cues like tone of voice, preceding conversation, or more elaborate phrasing, it's safest to interpret this statement at face value.

given this analysis, i would lean towards classifying this as:

label: not sarcastic

however, i acknowledge that with such a short statement and no context, there's a possibility that this could be sarcastic in the right situation. the classification is made with less than 90% confidence.",0

Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above.

        ### Input:
        1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.   4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

step 2: true intention

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.

- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

        ","to accurately classify this short input, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive. ""excellent"" is a strongly positive word, and referring to someone as ""doc"" could be a sign of respect or familiarity.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's any hidden meaning. the brevity of the statement could potentially be interpreted as dismissive or insincere, but this is not certain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the limited information and lack of clear sarcastic indicators (like exaggeration, irony, or contradiction), we should lean towards interpreting this statement at face value. while sarcasm can't be completely ruled out without more context, there's not enough evidence to confidently label it as sarcastic.

based on this analysis, the most appropriate label is:

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and somewhat callous. the statement ""we need young to survive"" seems straightforward, while ""it's the old that are expendable"" is a harsh sentiment. there are no overtly emotional words or emojis, but the content itself is provocative.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a critique of societal values or policies that prioritize older populations over younger ones. the statement is likely meant to shock or provoke thought by inverting common societal norms that often prioritize protecting the elderly. the use of ""expendable"" for older people is particularly jarring and likely intentional to elicit a reaction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a discrepancy between the surface-level, matter-of-fact tone and the shocking content of the message. the statement employs dark humor and exaggeration to make a point about societal priorities. the casual way of presenting such a controversial idea suggests the use of sarcasm to criticize certain attitudes or policies.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is intended to be sarcastic. it uses shock value and exaggeration to make a point, rather than being a sincere belief.

### label: sarcastic",1
Because their properties are contradictory.,0,"
### Example:
Input: ""it is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. most protestors on both sides aren't great. one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? you hear ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? no one would admit to this but it is statements like ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. and in that case, i agree...that can be a tough decision.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely trying to understand and analyze the reasons behind describing abortion as a ""hard decision."" they are examining the logic and motivations behind pro-choice arguments. the questions posed seem to be sincere attempts to understand the perspective, not rhetorical devices meant to ridicule.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (neutral reporting) aligns with the true intention (conveying information about a stance). there's no discrepancy between what is said and what is meant that would indicate sarcasm.

Label:

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the statement is quite brief and context-free, making it difficult to determine sarcasm with high confidence.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. there are no strong emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis. the statement is brief and matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's challenging to determine if there's a hidden intention. the statement appears to be a straightforward explanation of why something is contradictory. there are no obvious rhetorical devices or stylistic choices that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and apparent intention align. the statement is concise and direct, without any clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. 

given the lack of context and sarcastic indicators, the most likely interpretation is that this is a sincere statement.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and accommodating. the author states that the situation ""suits me"" and expresses a desire to avoid ""slighting anyone"". the tone seems considerate and agreeable.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are potential hints of sarcasm:
1. the phrase ""this actually suits me"" could be read as unexpectedly convenient, possibly too convenient.
2. the reason given (avoiding slighting anyone) seems somewhat exaggerated or overly diplomatic.
3. the overall tone is overly polite and formal, which can sometimes indicate sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a subtle discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the likely true intention. while outwardly positive, the statement seems to employ gentle mockery or irony. the excessive politeness and the convenient alignment with the skeptic's request suggest the author might be using sarcasm to indirectly express frustration or criticism of the situation.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is likely sarcastic, though it's a subtle form of sarcasm.

the text exhibits clear sarcastic tones throughout, particularly in its opening and closing statements. here's a brief breakdown:

1. the opening ""damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge"" is sarcastic praise, implying the opposite - that the links actually demonstrate ignorance.

2. ""do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?"" is a rhetorical question dripping with sarcasm, suggesting the sources provided are worthless.

3. the phrase ""ffs, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?"" uses exasperation and mock advice to sarcastically criticize the quality of the sources.

4. the closing ""do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old"" is sarcastic advice, implying the person's sources are outdated and unreliable.

while the middle section provides factual information, the overall tone and framing of the text is highly sarcastic, using rhetorical questions, mock praise, and exaggerated advice to criticize the other person's knowledge and sources.",1

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine question. the phrasing ""how do you explain"" suggests a request for clarification or explanation. there are no overtly sentimental phrases, emojis, or strong emotional keywords. the tone seems neutral and inquisitive.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, this question seems to be rhetorical rather than a genuine inquiry. it's phrased in a way that implies a contradiction in the logic of those who argue that gun laws don't affect criminals. by pointing to the uk as an example of low criminal gun use, the author is indirectly challenging the premise that gun laws are ineffective against criminals.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward question, the true intention is to make a point rather than seek information. this discrepancy between the apparent request for explanation and the implicit argument being made suggests a subtle use of sarcasm. the question is designed to highlight what the author likely sees as a flaw in the argument against gun control laws.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is subtly sarcastic. the use of a rhetorical question to make a point, rather than to genuinely seek information, is a common sarcastic technique.

### Example:
Input: ""the question is illogical. by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible. see another thread for that topic.   the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature. to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and frustrated. key phrases like ""double-standard"" and ""can't wait to see the backlash"" indicate disapproval and anticipation of negative consequences. the tone seems confrontational.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting perceived hypocrisy of the ""homosexual lobby"". the author is likely genuinely critical of this group's actions. however, the phrase ""i can't wait to see the backlash"" could be interpreted as sarcastic enthusiasm, implying the author actually expects and desires negative consequences for the group's actions.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while most of the text appears to be a straightforward criticism, the final sentence ""i can't wait to see the backlash from this one"" introduces an element of potential sarcasm. this phrase, in context, likely doesn't express genuine excitement but rather a sardonic anticipation of consequences. the author is using this sarcastic enthusiasm to emphasize their disapproval and expectation of negative outcomes.

given this analysis, i believe the text contains an element of sarcasm, particularly in the closing statement.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive of anti-abortion views. key phrases like ""tool with which to punish women,"" ""police state,"" and ""mythical golden age"" suggest a negative view of abortion bans. the tone seems confrontational and accusatory.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment but employs sarcasm to make its point. the author is using exaggeration and mock agreement (""got you"") to criticize anti-abortion arguments. the comparison to ""intelligent design"" and the phrase ""lying for baby jesus"" are used ironically to suggest dishonesty in the pro-life movement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention are aligned in their criticism of anti-abortion views, but the true intention employs sarcasm as a rhetorical device. the use of exaggerated language, mock agreement, and ironic comparisons are clear indicators of sarcasm. the author is not sincerely agreeing with the anti-abortion stance but rather using sarcasm to highlight what they see as the true motivations behind such policies.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- negative tone towards government agencies' competitiveness
- use of strong words like ""ridiculous"" and ""idiotic""
- quotation marks around ""afraid"" suggest skepticism

step 2: true intention

step 2: true intention
the statement seems to be a straightforward description or attribution of a quote to someone characterized as a ""troll"" who lives in the uk. while calling someone a ""troll"" can be negative, the overall intention appears to be simply identifying the source of a previous statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is no significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the statement doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or mock enthusiasm. it's a direct attribution that doesn't seem to hide any deeper meaning or contradiction.

Label:

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing frustration and pointing out the absurdity of the situation. the author is using rhetorical questions and a mocking tone to highlight what they perceive as illogical behavior from the other person.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment of seeking clarification and the true intention of mockery. the use of rhetorical questions and the exaggerated politeness in suggesting to ""simply agree that you were wrong"" are typical sarcastic devices. the author is not genuinely seeking clarification or documentation but is instead using sarcasm to point out the perceived ridiculousness of the situation.

        A more precise term would be ""broaden,"" since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, ""diluted"" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only ""change"" would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only ""change"" in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.   The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears polite and inquisitive due to the phrase ""pray tell"". however, the use of all caps for ""this"" suggests emphasis or frustration. the term ""strawman"" has a negative connotation in debates.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely confrontational and skeptical. the archaic ""pray tell"" is used ironically to mock the person being addressed. the speaker is accusing the other person of creating a strawman argument, implying dishonesty or poor reasoning. the emphasis on ""this"" suggests exasperation with what the speaker sees as a repeated pattern of flawed arguments.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface politeness of ""pray tell"" and the accusatory nature of the true intention. the formal language is being used sarcastically to emphasize the perceived absurdity of the other person's argument. this mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""they aren't afraid of that. that a government agency would actually be financially competitive is ridiculous. the only way it could compete for customers would be by running at an enormous loss or legislating away competition. that's what people are ""afraid"" of, not some idiotic speculation that government is great at business.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- negative tone towards government agencies' competitiveness
- use of strong words like ""ridiculous"" and ""idiotic""
- quotation marks around ""afraid"" suggest skepticism

### Example:
Input: ""if we were created in god's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of god's emotions. that our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   of course i would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. an 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- the first part presents a logical argument about human emotions being a reflection of god's.
- the second part introduces a contrasting personal view about the human invention of god.
- keywords like ""of course"" and phrases like ""angry god who will smite you"" might initially suggest sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
- the text presents two contrasting viewpoints on the origin of human emotions and god.
- the author clearly states their personal opinion (""i would personally say"") rather than using sarcasm to convey it.
- the language is direct and explanatory, presenting a logical argument for the author's perspective.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- while there are elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic (e.g., ""angry god who will smite you""), the overall tone is more analytical and explanatory.
- the author openly presents their view without relying on irony or sarcasm to make their point.
- the text aims to provide a reasoned argument rather than mock or ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears extremely negative towards religion. the text uses strong language and examples to criticize religion, mentioning religious wars, extremism, selfishness, racism, destruction of cultures, hatred, and ignorance. it sarcastically refers to these as things to be ""proud of"" and states that ""ignorance is bliss"" when it comes to religion. the tone is confrontational and critical throughout.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns closely with the surface sentiment. the author is genuinely criticizing religion and responding to a previous statement (likely by user grizzly6626) that portrayed religion positively. the examples and arguments presented (religious wars, terrorism, spanish inquisition, hitler's catholicism) are meant to counter pro-religion arguments. the sarcastic elements (""wow that's something for you to be proud of"" and ""ignorance is bliss"") are used to emphasize the criticism, not to mask a different meaning.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the text contains some sarcastic phrases, these are used to reinforce the overall critical message rather than to convey an opposite meaning. the sarcasm is a rhetorical device supporting the main argument, not the primary mode of communication. the author's true intention matches the surface sentiment of criticizing religion. the bookending statements about things not being ""any worse then it is right now"" are used for emphasis rather than to sarcastically imply things are actually good.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence:

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""it is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. most protestors on both sides aren't great. one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? you hear ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? no one would admit to this but it is statements like ""it was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. and in that case, i agree...that can be a tough decision.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text presents a critical but thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. it uses questioning to explore the complexities of the decision-making process. the tone is inquisitive and analytical rather than overtly emotional or mocking.

step 2: true intention

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention align in this text. there's no significant discrepancy between what is said and what is meant. the author is expressing their thoughts directly and honestly, without employing sarcasm or irony to make their point.

Label:
not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""the question is illogical. by declaring the existence of an all powerful god then saying god cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. your question by its very statement does not test wether or not god is all powerful but wether or not god is comprehensible. see another thread for that topic.   the statement that god is all powerful defines his nature. to state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be a serious, logical argument. it uses formal language and philosophical concepts without obvious emotional indicators or exaggeration.

step 2: true intention
the author is genuinely attempting to explain a logical fallacy in the reasoning about god's nature and omnipotence. the intention is to provide a thoughtful, rational critique of the original question.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention align. there are no contradictions between the literal meaning and the intended message. the text lacks typical sarcastic elements like irony, exaggeration, or mock enthusiasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""i might have agreed with you"" suggests a potential for agreement, which is generally positive.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be expressing regret or criticism. the use of ""should have"" implies that the action didn't actually happen, and the speaker is pointing out a missed opportunity. the second sentence, ""i might have agreed with you,"" suggests that because the first action didn't occur, agreement didn't happen either.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface seems neutral or slightly positive, the underlying message is one of missed opportunity and implicit criticism. the use of ""might have"" in the second sentence adds a layer of hypothetical agreement that didn't actually occur, emphasizing the regret or criticism.

given this analysis, the statement appears to be using subtle irony to convey disappointment or criticism, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
there are no clear indicators of sarcasm or irony in this statement. the language is straightforward and doesn't employ exaggeration or contradiction. the phrase ""come around"" implies a genuine change of opinion or agreement after previous disagreement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns with the likely true intention of the speaker. there's no discrepancy between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which is typically present in sarcastic statements.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeing with the statement that an eyewitness would mean nothing. the phrase ""yeah right"" typically indicates agreement.

step 2: true intention
however, ""yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or disagreement. the structure of the sentence, starting with ""so, you're saying..."" followed by an extreme statement and then ""yeah right,"" suggests that the speaker is actually disagreeing with the idea that an eyewitness would mean nothing.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (apparent agreement) and the likely true intention (disagreement). the use of ""yeah right"" in this context is a common sarcastic expression used to convey the opposite of what is literally being said.

based on this analysis, the final label is:

sarcastic",1
"Do you have a fire extinguisher in your house? I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there. I look at wearing firearms for self defense the same way I look at wearing a seat belt. I wear it and pray I'll never need it, but I'll be damn glad I'm wearing it if I do need it.   God Bless",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

the surface sentiment appears sympathetic and concerned, with phrases like ""oh what a shame!"" and ""especially if it's true!"" the question at the end seems to be genuinely seeking information.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention appears to be sarcastic and critical. the exclamation marks in the first two sentences seem exaggerated, suggesting insincerity. the question at the end is likely rhetorical, implying that the speaker believes id theory is indeed based on evidence and testing, contrary to what someone else might have suggested.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sympathy and concern in step 1 contrasts sharply with the underlying criticism and sarcasm revealed in step 2. the exaggerated sympathy and the rhetorical question are used to mock and challenge the idea that id theory lacks evidence or testing. this disconnect between the surface sentiment and the true intention is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem. I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year.   What school are you at?

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let's analyze this step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a serious discussion about gun safety and university policies. the author uses statistics (""murder rate at my house was 0"") and asks a genuine question at the end (""what school are you at?""). the tone seems matter-of-fact and logical.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the exaggerated examples and tone. the author is using hyperbole and absurd comparisons (comparing a house to a university campus) to mock the idea that the presence of weapons inherently increases danger. the statement about maintaining a 0 murder rate at their house is an oversimplification of a complex issue.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be a logical argument, the true intention is to ridicule gun-free policies through exaggeration and false equivalencies. the sarcasm lies in the casual comparison between a private home and a university campus, and the implication that personal experience with guns at home is directly applicable to a large, diverse university setting.

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and critical. key phrases like ""it is a pity that you're unwilling to debate"" and ""endeavour a smear campaign"" indicate disapproval. the tone seems assertive and slightly admonishing, especially with ""i would advise you read the above quote before talking again.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to call out and criticize the person being addressed. the author is pointing out perceived flaws in the other person's behavior, specifically their unwillingness to engage in proper debate and their tendency to resort to smear tactics. the advice to read a quote before speaking again is likely meant to highlight the addressee's perceived ignorance or lack of understanding.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly critical and confrontational, there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the author is being direct in their criticism and doesn't seem to be using irony or saying the opposite of what they mean. the tone is stern and admonishing, but it doesn't appear to be employing sarcasm to make its point.

given this analysis, i believe the correct label is:

not sarcastic

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation

the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        I note that you consider yourself irrational, though I could not possibly comment. There are times that I am grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the Atlantic, but then I allow for your need to identify with your adopted home and reject the motherland.   You flatter yourself in assuming that you were any part of my considerations when choosing to post. The button reference is a play on words known as a pun.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let me analyze this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears polite and somewhat formal. phrases like ""i note that"", ""i could not possibly comment"", and ""i am grateful"" give an impression of respectful discourse. the tone seems measured and controlled.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be mockery and criticism disguised as polite conversation. key indicators:
- ""i note that you consider yourself irrational"" is a backhanded compliment.
- ""grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the atlantic"" is a thinly veiled insult.
- ""allow for your need to identify with your adopted home and reject the motherland"" implies the person is rejecting their roots insincerely.
- ""you flatter yourself"" directly accuses the other person of self-importance.
- the explanation of the pun at the end seems condescending.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the polite surface sentiment and the underlying criticism and mockery. the author uses formal language and seemingly respectful phrases to deliver insults and put-downs. this mismatch between the surface politeness and the true critical intention is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can confidently say:

### label: sarcastic",1

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and defensive. the author is correcting a misquotation and challenging the other person to provide evidence. the tone seems serious and slightly accusatory, with phrases like ""please do not exaggerate my statements"" and ""you have a habit of making over-inflated statements.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to call out the other person's argumentative tactics and question their credibility. the author is using rhetorical questions and statements to imply that the other person frequently exaggerates or misrepresents information. the phrase ""care to produce some figures"" is likely not a genuine request for information, but a challenge meant to expose the lack of concrete evidence.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is confrontational, the true intention aligns with this confrontational tone. the author is being direct in their criticism and challenge, rather than using irony or exaggeration to convey their point. the language is pointed but straightforward, without the typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggerated praise or mock agreement.

label: not sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning or mildly skeptical. the use of ""don't you think?"" suggests the speaker is seeking agreement or confirmation. the comparison to presidential support seems to be presenting factual information.

step 2: true intention
upon closer analysis, the true intention seems to be sarcastic or ironic. the statement ""60% accepting roe v wade is a high figure"" is likely meant to imply the opposite - that 60% is actually not a high figure. the comparison to presidential support further emphasizes this point, suggesting that abortion rights are more popular than the president, which is meant to highlight the perceived disconnect between public opinion and policy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface questioning tone contrasts with the underlying criticism of the 60% figure being considered ""high."" the seemingly factual comparison to presidential support is used to reinforce the sarcastic point rather than provide neutral information. the overall structure of the statement is designed to lead the reader to question the initial premise through sarcasm.

based on this analysis, the label is:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be calming and reassuring, with phrases like ""shh shhh it's ok"" and ""mellow mellow mellow."" it also seems to empathize with gay people's desire for happiness and suggests commonality between the addressee and gay people.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock and criticize the addressee's overreaction to gay marriage legalization. this is evident through:
- exaggeration: ""collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man's ability to reason and govern himself""
- condescending tone: ""shh shhh it's ok mellow mellow mellow""
- pointing out logical fallacies: going from legalizing gay marriage to societal collapse ""in two paragraphs""
- irony: suggesting the addressee's happiness from marriage is worth ""oppressiveness,"" mirroring their argument against gay marriage

step 3: comparison and analysis
the calming surface sentiment sharply contrasts with the mocking and critical true intention. the use of exaggeration, condescension, and irony clearly indicates sarcasm. the author is using these devices to highlight the perceived absurdity of the addressee's arguments against gay marriage.

the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine question about praying to chance. the use of ""so"" at the beginning suggests it's a follow-up or conclusion to a previous statement or argument.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, this sentence is likely not a genuine question but a rhetorical one. the idea of praying to ""chance"" is inherently contradictory, as chance is not a deity or conscious entity to which one would pray. this suggests the speaker is using this question to point out a logical inconsistency or absurdity in someone else's argument or belief system.

the surface question (step 1) contrasts with the underlying intention (step 2) of pointing out an absurdity. the use of a rhetorical question to highlight this contradiction is a common sarcastic technique. the speaker is not actually considering praying to chance, but rather using this idea to mock or criticize an opposing viewpoint.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be proposing serious policy ideas, with phrases like ""it's fair because..."" and references to legal precedents. the tone seems authoritative and matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the proposal of a ""$100 sin tax"" for logging on and ""$10 per word"" is clearly hyperbolic and unrealistic. the mention of ""lying propaganda damage"" suggests a hostile attitude towards the target audience. the abrupt ""next!"" at the end implies dismissiveness.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly serious policy proposal on the surface and the absurd, exaggerated nature of the suggested ""sin tax"" strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using hyperbole and mock seriousness to ridicule and criticize their opponents, rather than making a genuine policy suggestion.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and somewhat frustrated. key phrases like ""anti-anything education"" and ""shouldn't expect them to argue positions that make sense"" indicate a negative view of a certain group of people. there are no positive keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns closely with the surface sentiment. the author is expressing genuine criticism of people who are against education, suggesting that their arguments lack sense or logic. the phrase ""chalk it up to"" indicates the author is offering an explanation for this behavior.

step 3: comparison and analysis
in this case, the surface sentiment and true intention are consistent. there's no apparent mismatch or irony that would indicate sarcasm. the author is straightforwardly expressing their opinion without using sarcastic devices or exaggeration.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be matter-of-fact and slightly speculative. there are no overtly positive or negative words, and no emojis. the tone seems casual and conversational, with phrases like ""well nobody has turned up"" and ""could assure that if properly used.""

step 2: true intention
examining deeper:
- the mention of the ark refers to noah's ark from biblical stories.
- suggesting termites could destroy the ark contradicts the divine protection implied in the biblical narrative.
- the phrase ""after 40 days and more they would be ravenous"" plays on the 40 days and nights of the flood in the bible, but focuses on a mundane detail (hungry termites) rather than the miraculous aspects of the story.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface tone with the underlying meaning reveals a sarcastic intent:
- the casual tone belies the critique of a significant religious story.
- by suggesting termites as a simple explanation for why the ark hasn't been found, the comment undermines the extraordinary nature of the biblical account.
- the focus on hungry termites trivializes the grand scale of the flood narrative.

the comment uses dry humor and understatement to sarcastically question the plausibility of the noah's ark story.

the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ### Input:
        Why you quoted me is questionable. What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of ****. How you consider mathematical equations ""mockery"" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video. Instead, in your normal fashion, you simply ASSUMED what you wanted to believe and then went from there rather then actually looking at what it was and what it had to say.   Your post more accurately is towards the link that AA posted in defense of his beliefs (yet failed to realize was satirizing those beliefs). Furthermore, I'm not an atheist even though your poor definition wants me to be.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or

        ### Label: 

        ","i believe a step-by-step analysis would be beneficial for this complex input. let me break it down:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears frustrated and defensive. the author uses strong language like ""questionable,"" ""full of ****,"" and criticizes the addressee's ""normal fashion"" of making assumptions. there's an accusatory tone throughout, with phrases like ""you did not bother to watch the video"" and ""you simply assumed.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a genuine rebuttal against perceived misrepresentation and misunderstanding. the author is trying to clarify their position, defend their original post, and point out what they see as flaws in the addressee's reasoning and behavior. there's an underlying frustration with being misunderstood or mislabeled.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that the surface frustration aligns with the true intention of rebutting and clarifying. while the tone is confrontational and critical, it doesn't appear to be using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. the author is directly expressing their disagreement and frustration without employing sarcasm as a rhetorical device.

given this analysis, i would classify this text as:

not sarcastic

the text is confrontational and critical, but it lacks the hallmark reversal of meaning or irony that characterizes sarcasm. the author is being direct in their criticism and clarification rather than using sarcasm to make their point.",0

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears exasperated and dismissive. key indicators:
- ""oh brother.."" suggests frustration or annoyance
- ""so what if..."" implies dismissal of a hypothetical scenario
- ""this is rediculous"" (misspelled ""ridiculous"") expresses strong disapproval

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to mock or criticize an argument by using an extreme comparison:
- the statement creates a false equivalence between an unspecified issue (likely gay marriage, based on context) and legalizing murder
- the rhetorical ""so what if..."" isn't genuinely asking, but rather implying that majority opinion shouldn't always dictate policy
- the misspelling of ""ridiculous"" might be intentional to further emphasize the perceived absurdity

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly negative, the true intention goes beyond simple disagreement. the use of hyperbole (comparing an issue to legalizing murder) and the rhetorical question format suggest a sarcastic tone. the speaker is not literally suggesting that legalizing murder is comparable to the issue at hand, but rather using this extreme example to satirize the argument that majority opinion should always determine policy.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

        ","sarcastic

this short question is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""mongoloid"" - an outdated and offensive term - coupled with ""is this 1937?"" implies criticism of someone using such antiquated and inappropriate language. the speaker is not genuinely asking about the year, but rather expressing shock and disapproval at the use of an offensive term, sarcastically suggesting that such language belongs to a much earlier, less enlightened time period.",1

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly regretful. phrases like ""oh, well"" and ""too bad"" suggest a gentle disappointment. the speaker seems to be cordially declining a discussion and wishing the other person good luck.

step 2 (true intention):
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems dismissive and condescending:
- ""apparently you want to talk molecular chemistry"" implies the other person is off-topic or missing the point.
- ""i was hoping to discuss organismic evolution"" suggests the speaker's topic is more relevant or important.
- ""good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic"" implies few people would be interested in the other person's chosen subject.
- ""it just doesn't interest me"" is a blunt dismissal of the other person's topic.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the polite surface tone contrasts sharply with the underlying dismissive attitude. the speaker uses seemingly courteous language to mask a sarcastic dismissal of the other person's topic and intellectual interests. the false politeness and feigned regret serve to emphasize the speaker's perceived superiority and disdain for the other person's chosen topic of discussion.

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of neutral and negative. the first part ""breaking news: shooting in dallas office tower - ctnow"" is a neutral news headline. the second part ""ah, the good old gun-crazy us of a"" uses positive-sounding words like ""good old"" but pairs them with the negative phrase ""gun-crazy"".

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and express frustration with gun violence in the united states. the use of ""ah"" and ""good old"" is clearly ironic, as the speaker doesn't actually think gun violence is good. the phrase ""gun-crazy us of a"" is a derogatory way to describe the united states, implying that the country has an unhealthy obsession with guns.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the seemingly positive ""good old"" and the negative reality of a shooting. the speaker is using verbal irony to express their disapproval and frustration with the frequency of gun violence in the us. the casual tone (""ah"") in response to a serious news event further emphasizes the sarcastic nature of the comment.

based on this analysis, the label is clearly sarcastic.

analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as it's a short, ambiguous statement that requires careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a simple question. there are no overtly sarcastic keywords, emotive phrases, or emojis. it seems to be a straightforward inquiry about the nature of god.

step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this question is likely rhetorical. by asking if god is ""unnatural,"" the speaker may be challenging a premise or argument that contrasts god with natural phenomena. this question could be used to point out a logical inconsistency in someone else's argument about the nature of god or the natural world.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be a simple question, the likely rhetorical nature suggests a sarcastic intent. the question is probably not seeking a genuine answer but rather pointing out a perceived flaw in reasoning. the contrast between the seemingly innocent surface question and the underlying challenge indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be shock and disagreement. key phrases like ""wow"" and ""your logic... would be perfect"" seem to express amazement or agreement at first glance. the text also uses questions and hypothetical scenarios.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the other person's stance on gun control. the extreme example of a 10-year-old with an uzi is used to highlight the perceived absurdity of the other person's position. the ""wow"" is not genuine amazement but disbelief at the perceived ridiculousness of the idea. the statement about logic being ""perfect"" is actually pointing out a major flaw in the argument.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the use of extreme examples, rhetorical questions, and fake agreement (""would be perfect"") are all hallmarks of sarcasm. the author is using these techniques to ridicule the opposing viewpoint on gun control, not to genuinely agree or be amazed.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and critical. there are several rhetorical questions and accusatory statements like ""obviously, you're gullible"" and ""since you're such a brainiac and all"". the tone seems aggressive and dismissive of the other person's viewpoint.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to strongly criticize and mock the other person's stance on gun control and their perceived naivety. the author is using rhetorical questions and exaggerated statements to imply that the other person is foolish for trusting certain organizations or viewpoints. the suggestion to ""read this slower this time (if that helps)"" is clearly meant to be insulting.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is openly confrontational, the true intention goes beyond mere disagreement to employ sarcasm as a rhetorical tool. the use of phrases like ""oh, let's just see what sarah brady wants to do?"" and ""since you're such a brainiac and all"" are clearly sarcastic, using mock agreement or praise to actually convey contempt. the exaggerated politeness in suggesting to read slower is another clear indicator of sarcasm.

the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","sarcastic

the opening phrase ""what quaint illogic"" immediately sets a sarcastic tone. the author is using mock politeness to criticize someone else's reasoning. 

the rest of the text continues this sarcastic dissection of the flawed logic being addressed. the author uses exaggeration and irony to highlight the absurdity of the argument they're criticizing, particularly in the final sentence where they point out that the situation actually indicates an even higher divorce rate than normal.

the contrast between the seemingly polite opening and the biting criticism that follows, along with the use of irony and exaggeration, are clear indicators of sarcasm throughout this response.",1
"Wow, you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud? I didn't see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals. I must have overlooked it. Can you give the reference to your article?",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears positive and impressed. words like ""wow"" and phrases like ""i didn't see this clear refutation"" and ""i must have overlooked it"" suggest genuine interest and acknowledgment of a significant achievement. the request for a reference at the end seems to indicate sincere curiosity.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock and ridicule the person who claimed to have disproven the big bang theory. the use of all caps in ""proved"" is likely exaggeration for effect. the mention of ""peer reviewed scientific journals"" highlights the lack of credible evidence for such a claim. the rhetorical question about overlooking it further emphasizes the absurdity of the claim.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
there's a clear disconnect between the surface positivity and the underlying mockery. the exaggerated praise and feigned interest are used to highlight the implausibility of disproving a well-established scientific theory without any credible evidence or recognition from the scientific community. the sarcastic tone is maintained throughout, using false politeness and curiosity to emphasize the ridiculousness of the claim.

given this analysis, the label is clearly:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

        ","i think i should analyze this step-by-step to be more confident in my classification:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive and concerned. the text consists of two questions asking for clarification about the situation in india, specifically about people's reactions to a violent incident and their desire for change. the language used includes phrases like ""upset about what happened"", ""violently murdered"", and ""better prepared to handle it"", which convey a serious and concerned tone.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention seems to be challenging or contradicting an unstated claim. the repeated use of ""are you saying that..."" suggests the author is not genuinely asking for information, but rather pointing out flaws in someone else's argument or perspective. the questions are rhetorical, designed to emphasize what the author believes are obvious reactions from the indian people.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
while the surface sentiment appears to be seeking information, the true intention is to make a point through rhetorical questions. the author is using these questions to sarcastically imply that the opposite of what's being asked is true - that the indian people are indeed upset and seeking change. the sarcasm lies in the implication that anyone would think otherwise.

        ","to properly analyze this text, i'll need to go through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be serious and informative. the author provides detailed technical information about various weapons, their specifications, and defensive strategies. the tone seems confident and knowledgeable, with phrases like ""preparedness my friends..."" suggesting sincerity.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention appears to be satirical or sarcastic. the level of detail and the extreme nature of the preparations (multiple high-powered weapons, trained attack dog) seem exaggerated. the comparison to ""vor"" with a ""rechargable phone"" and ""fancy pug"" creates a stark contrast that feels intentionally humorous.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the disconnect between the serious, technical surface tone and the underlying exaggeration points to sarcasm. the author is likely mocking overzealous ""preppers"" or gun enthusiasts. the final ""sincerely"" signed by ""1 constitutional rights violator and 1 law abiding citizen"" further emphasizes the satirical nature of the text.

There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis.

- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""

- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.   Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or

        ","to analyze this text thoroughly, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and argumentative. the text uses rhetorical questions, accusations (""bull""), and dismissive language (""that dog just doesn't hunt""). the tone seems defensive of religious people's right to use their beliefs as a basis for social views.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be a genuine argument against the idea that using religion as a basis for moral judgments is inherently wrong or imposing. the author is trying to point out perceived inconsistencies in the opposing viewpoint and defend the right of religious people to participate in social discourse based on their beliefs.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the tone is confrontational and the language is somewhat forceful, there doesn't seem to be a significant disconnect between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the author is directly challenging the opposing view without using irony or misdirection typically associated with sarcasm. the rhetorical devices used (like rhetorical questions and analogies) are employed to strengthen the argument rather than to convey a meaning opposite to what is literally said.

based on this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

label: not sarcastic

the text is argumentative and confrontational, but it doesn't employ sarcasm to make its point. instead, it presents a direct critique and counterargument to an opposing viewpoint.",0

step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough evaluation:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of questioning, explanatory, and critical. the text starts with rhetorical questions and then moves into explanations about biblical interpretations. the tone seems somewhat confrontational and challenging, especially when addressing the inconsistencies in biblical interpretations.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be to criticize and mock the inconsistent interpretations of the bible. the author is using rhetorical devices such as sarcasm and irony to highlight what they perceive as logical fallacies in literal biblical interpretation. the statement ""god changed it"" is particularly sarcastic, implying the absurdity of changing scientific facts to fit biblical narratives.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment includes explanatory elements, the underlying tone is decidedly sarcastic. the author uses rhetorical questions, exaggerated statements (like ""god changed it""), and pointed criticisms to convey their skepticism towards literal biblical interpretation. the sarcasm is especially evident in phrases like ""i get it"" and ""you 'interpret' and then claim that you are reading it literally,"" which mock the perceived inconsistencies in the opponent's arguments.

given this analysis, the final label is:

- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration

step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears to be informative and slightly confrontational. the phrase ""oh really"" suggests a challenging tone. the rest of the text seems to be providing information about a petition drive in michigan and offering a link for further explanation.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention seems to be to counter an unmentioned previous statement or assumption. the ""oh really"" at the beginning indicates disagreement or disbelief. the author is presenting evidence (the link) to support their position that the petition drive aims to deny them marriage rights. the phrase ""here i will let the head of the organization... explain it in her own words"" suggests the author believes this evidence will be damning or conclusive.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
while there is a slight mismatch between the initial ""oh really"" and the rest of the seemingly informative text, this doesn't appear to be sarcasm. instead, it seems to be a genuine attempt to refute a point by providing evidence. the tone is more confrontational and direct rather than sarcastic.

label: not sarcastic

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

the surface sentiment appears to be one of amusement or laughter, indicated by the exaggerated ""bwaaaaaaahahahahahahahah"" at the beginning. this is followed by a question that seems to be seeking clarification or expressing disbelief.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be mockery or ridicule. the exaggerated laughter suggests the speaker finds the idea absurd or laughable. the following question is likely rhetorical, not genuinely seeking an answer, but rather pointing out the perceived absurdity of the idea that dna would reflect one's current location.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the surface amusement and the underlying mockery strongly indicates sarcasm. the exaggerated laughter is not genuine joy but rather a way to express derision. the rhetorical question further reinforces the sarcastic tone by highlighting the perceived ridiculousness of the idea being discussed.

the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let me think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears informative and slightly critical. the first sentence seems to be stating a fact about future social security funding. the second sentence, however, has a more negative tone with the phrase ""causing stains,"" which could be seen as insulting.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we analyze the language more closely:
- ""walking sperm"" is a derogatory way to refer to children or young people.
- the contrast between the future contributions of these ""walking sperm"" and matt's ""sperm"" is deliberately provocative.
- the rhetorical question ""what will your sperm be doing besides causing stains?"" is clearly meant to insult and belittle matt.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment attempts to present some factual information, the true intention is to mock and insult matt. the use of crude language and the rhetorical question create a stark contrast between the seemingly informative first sentence and the insulting second sentence. this mismatch, combined with the overall tone of mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can confidently classify this as:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. the comparison of an embryo's point of view to a rock's point of view suggests the author finds the idea absurd. there are no overtly positive words or phrases, and the tone seems matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock or criticize the idea of writing from an embryo's perspective. the author uses a logical argument (embryos don't have a point of view) and then employs hyperbole by comparing it to writing from a rock's perspective. this exaggeration is meant to emphasize the perceived ridiculousness of the concept.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is critical, the true intention goes beyond simple criticism to employ sarcasm. the use of exaggeration and the absurd comparison to a rock's point of view are clear indicators of sarcastic intent. the author is not merely stating that embryos don't have a point of view, but is using this fact to ridicule the entire premise in a sarcastic manner.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

the input ""and"" is a simple conjunction word without any context or additional information. it does not contain any elements that would suggest sarcasm, such as contrasting sentiments, exaggeration, or irony. as a standalone word, it is neutral and functional, used to connect words or clauses. therefore, it can be confidently classified as not sarcastic.",0
"Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.",1,"
### Example:

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and somewhat critical. the use of ""scientific rigor"" suggests a respect for evidence-based approaches. the phrase ""god of the gaps"" is used, which is often associated with critiques of religious explanations for scientific phenomena.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a strong criticism of organizations that claim scientific rigor while holding religious beliefs. the rhetorical question ""where are those organizations with such scientific rigor?"" implies skepticism about their existence. the phrase ""god of the gaps has become microscopic"" is using metaphor to suggest that the space for religious explanations in science has drastically shrunk.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment asks a question that could be interpreted as genuine, the true intention is to mock organizations that claim scientific credibility while maintaining religious explanations for phenomena. the use of ""must be"" in ""they must be in the position to understand"" is likely sarcastic, implying that these organizations are failing to recognize the contradiction in their stance. the metaphor of a ""microscopic"" god of the gaps further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly using sarcasm to criticize certain organizations' scientific claims.

the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

the surface sentiment appears neutral. there are no strong emotional words, no emojis, and no clear positive or negative connotations. it's a simple statement about questions asked by creationists.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning. however, the phrase ""and many of the questions that creationists ask"" could be implying that these questions are somehow problematic, irrelevant, or misguided. the use of ""and"" at the beginning suggests this statement is part of a larger conversation or argument.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, there's a possibility of an implied criticism of creationist questions. however, without more context or clear indicators of sarcasm (like exaggeration, irony, or contrasting tone), we can't confidently label this as sarcastic.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the brevity of the statement, i would lean towards classifying this as not sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

the text appears to be a serious, critical analysis of scientific methodology and peer review practices. while it does use some strong language (""lying propagandist"", ""smacks of hyperbole""), these phrases are used to describe someone else's rhetoric, not as sarcasm. the overall tone is analytical and explanatory, discussing the merits of olsen's critique of national geographic's articles. the author is making a straightforward argument about the importance of rigorous scientific methods and proper peer review, especially for well-respected publications. there's no evident mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention that would indicate sarcasm.",0

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed. ""gooey cute"" suggests a positive, endearing quality. however, the phrase ""how is this relevant"" introduces a critical or questioning tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism or dismissal. the use of ""gooey cute"" is likely not genuinely positive, but rather a mocking characterization. the question ""how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" implies that the subject matter is inappropriate or off-topic for a serious philosophical discussion.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly positive ""gooey cute"" and the critical question about relevance creates a sarcastic tone. the author is using mock endearment to emphasize how out of place or trivial they find the subject matter in the context of philosophy.

All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument. How could anyone argue with your brand of logic? That would be senseless.

        ### Label: 

        ","i will think through this step-by-step, as it's a complex text that requires careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a detailed, factual rebuttal of evolutionary theory in favor of creationism. it presents numerous ""predictions"" that align with a literal interpretation of the bible and contrasts them with perceived flaws in evolutionary theory. the tone seems earnest and informative.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the text uses exaggerated claims and oversimplifications of scientific concepts.
- it employs rhetorical questions and mock agreements (""that fossils exist. now that is a brilliant statement."")
- the final paragraphs become increasingly mocking, with statements like ""you are on a roll"" and ""you present a brilliant argument.""
- the closing sentence, ""how could anyone argue with your brand of logic? that would be senseless,"" is clearly sarcastic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment presents as a sincere argument for creationism, the true intention is to mock and ridicule evolutionary theory and its proponents. the text starts with a seemingly serious tone but gradually becomes more overtly sarcastic, culminating in clear mockery at the end. the contrast between the initial pseudo-scientific arguments and the final openly sarcastic statements reveals the overall sarcastic nature of the text.

"And the moon could fall from the sky, too.",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a simple, neutral statement about a hypothetical event. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords, emojis, or sentimental phrases. the statement merely suggests the possibility of the moon falling from the sky.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the statement is likely a response to something else, suggesting an impossible or highly improbable event.
- the phrase ""and the moon could fall from the sky, too"" is using hyperbole (extreme exaggeration) to make a point.
- this type of statement is often used to sarcastically dismiss another claim or suggestion as being equally improbable or absurd.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the neutral surface sentiment with the underlying intention reveals a clear disconnect. the seemingly straightforward statement about the moon is actually being used to convey skepticism or ridicule towards another idea. this use of hyperbole to express disbelief or mockery is a classic sarcastic technique.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat neutral or even slightly positive. the phrase ""it surely doesn't sound like he's a nazi to me"" suggests a defense of someone against accusations of being a nazi. the speaker seems to be presenting themselves as rational and level-headed.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention appears to be quite different:
- the use of ""surely"" can be read as emphatic or sarcastic.
- the second part of the sentence, ""but then again, i don't suffer from paranoid delusions either,"" is key to understanding the true meaning.
- this implies that those who do think the person in question is a nazi are suffering from paranoid delusions.
- the speaker is actually mocking and criticizing those who make such accusations.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the seemingly straightforward first part of the sentence and the biting criticism in the second part. the speaker is using verbal irony to convey their message. they're not genuinely defending someone against nazi accusations, but rather sarcastically implying that such accusations are absurd and those who make them are delusional.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock priscilla's behavior. the author is highlighting the contradiction between priscilla's admitted lack of knowledge and her willingness to offer an opinion. the phrase ""as mr. jack said, interesting"" is likely referring to a previous sarcastic comment, reinforcing the mocking tone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. while the surface appears to be seeking clarification, the actual intent is to sarcastically point out the illogical nature of priscilla's actions. the use of the rhetorical device of restating priscilla's position in a way that highlights its absurdity, coupled with the sardonic ""interesting"" at the end, strongly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears uncertain or mildly inquisitive. the phrase ""i dunno"" indicates uncertainty, and the question mark at the end suggests it's a genuine query.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems different:
- the casual ""i dunno"" contrasts with the specific medical term ""third trimester,"" suggesting feigned ignorance.
- the question is likely rhetorical, not seeking a genuine answer.
- the mention of the ""third trimester"" in this context (without more context) could be implying something absurd or impossible, as the third trimester is very late in pregnancy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the surface uncertainty and the specific medical terminology suggests the speaker is not genuinely unsure. the rhetorical nature of the question and the potential absurdity of the implication (depending on context) strongly indicate sarcasm. the speaker is likely mocking someone else's statement or position by pretending to seriously consider an absurd possibility.

Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of curiosity and questioning, with phrases like ""hmmm... interesting"" and ""where does this inalienable right derive from and how does it really work?"" however, there's also a challenging tone, especially with the example about creating an extremist army and the request to ""drop the rhetoric"".

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to challenge and criticize the previous speaker's argument. the use of an extreme example (creating a terrorist organization) is likely meant to highlight the absurdity of the original claim. the phrase ""please drop the rhetoric"" suggests the author believes the previous speaker was using empty or misleading language.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the opening ""hmmm... interesting"" might initially seem genuinely curious, the rest of the text reveals a more critical and challenging stance. the extreme example and the direct request to explain further indicate that the author is not actually finding the previous argument interesting or convincing, but rather flawed and in need of clarification.

however, while there are elements of criticism and challenge here, the overall tone doesn't seem to reach the level of sarcasm. the author is being direct in their disagreement and request for clarification, rather than using irony or saying the opposite of what they mean.

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ","sarcastic

i am confident in this classification based on the following analysis:

the surface sentiment appears positive with the exclamation ""way to go!"" which typically indicates praise or approval. however, this contrasts sharply with the critical content of ""make a controversial, unsupported assertion"".

the true intention is to criticize winston for making an unsupported, controversial statement. the use of ""way to..."" is a common sarcastic structure used to mock or criticize someone's actions while superficially sounding like praise.

the mismatch between the seemingly positive opening and the actual criticism, along with the typical sarcastic phrasing, clearly indicates this statement is sarcastic.",1
"Yes they sure will.... with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns. But if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole (literary form of exageration to express a point) I will try in the future to keep it down to your level.",1,"
### Example:

- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ### Label: 

        ","let's analyze this step by step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable at first with ""yes they sure will...."", but quickly shifts to a critical tone. the use of statistics and the phrase ""seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns"" suggests a straightforward argument. the final sentence appears condescending with phrases like ""if your intellect is not up to understanding"" and ""i will try in the future to keep it down to your level.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock and criticize the person being addressed and their argument. the use of statistics is meant to undermine the importance of gun control. the mention of hyperbole suggests the writer is calling out the other person for not understanding exaggeration. the final sentence is clearly meant to insult the other person's intelligence.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the initial agreement ""yes they sure will...."" is immediately contradicted by the rest of the text, indicating sarcasm. the use of statistics to make a counterpoint is presented in a way that mocks the original argument. the explicit mention of hyperbole and the insulting final sentence further reinforce the sarcastic tone throughout the entire text.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears positive and supportive. the phrase ""good for you"" and ""you're getting it"" seem to be offering praise and encouragement.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is likely to be critical or mocking. the first sentence sets up a contrast between majority opinion and what's morally right, implying that following the majority might be wrong. the second part, ""good for you. you're getting it,"" seems exaggerated and patronizing in this context.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the contrast between the seemingly supportive surface sentiment and the underlying critical or mocking intention strongly suggests sarcasm. the use of rhetorical questioning and exaggerated praise are common sarcastic devices. the speaker is likely criticizing the idea of blindly following majority opinion, especially on sensitive issues like gay marriage.

Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ","not sarcastic

this text appears to be a straightforward, honest expression of the author's thoughts without any sarcastic undertones. the author is directly stating their opinion about why they think someone might be a troll, and then explaining their view on expertise within a particular community. the language is clear and direct, without any obvious irony, exaggeration, or mocking tone that would typically indicate sarcasm. the author seems to be genuinely expressing their perspective on the nature of knowledge and expertise in the context they're discussing.",0

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

        ### Label: 

        ","not sarcastic

this text does not appear to be sarcastic. the author is expressing strong opinions and criticisms in a direct, confrontational manner, but there's no evidence of irony or mocking tone that would indicate sarcasm. the language is blunt and accusatory, but it seems to reflect the writer's genuine beliefs and frustrations rather than a sarcastic intent.",0

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and critical. the use of rhetorical questions (""double standards much?"") suggests frustration or disagreement with a perceived inconsistency.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to point out perceived hypocrisy or inconsistency in how people view embryos or fetuses in different contexts. the author is implying that some people consider an embryo or fetus as a pregnancy when it's inside a human, but not when it's outside (likely referring to ivf or similar procedures). the phrase ""double standards much?"" is clearly sarcastic, emphasizing the perceived absurdity of this distinction.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface questioning aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent. the use of rhetorical questions and the pointed ""double standards much?"" phrase are classic sarcastic techniques used to highlight perceived logical inconsistencies or hypocrisy. the author is not genuinely asking for clarification but rather using sarcasm to criticize a viewpoint.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive and somewhat formal. the use of ""would you care to tell us"" and ""where we might find"" suggests politeness and curiosity. there are no overtly negative words or emojis.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention seems to be skeptical or challenging. the use of quotation marks around ""official ideological goals"" suggests doubt about their existence or legitimacy. the phrase ""certifiable copy"" further emphasizes this skepticism, implying that such goals might not actually exist in any official capacity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the polite, inquisitive surface tone and the underlying skepticism. the use of formal language and rhetorical questions serves to emphasize the speaker's doubt about the existence of these ""official ideological goals"". this mismatch between the surface politeness and the underlying challenge is a common feature of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

the surface sentiment of religious salvation is undermined by the casual tone, food references, and irreverent suggestions. the stark contrast between the initial religious content and the subsequent trivial and irreverent thoughts strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is likely mocking the concept of religious conversion or salvation.

given this analysis, i can confidently say:

"Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","not sarcastic

the text appears to be a detailed, serious explanation of the author's views on gun control legislation. while the tone is occasionally frustrated or confrontational, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. the author is making earnest arguments, using analogies, addressing counterpoints, and providing examples to support their position. the language is direct and argumentative, but not ironic or mocking in a way that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, this text is best classified as not sarcastic.",0
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","to analyze this input thoroughly, i'll go through the steps:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""fairly common occurrence"" suggests a matter-of-fact tone. the word ""whining"" has a negative connotation, implying criticism of the article's author.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to criticize or discredit the article's author. the speaker is pointing out that the local police aren't complaining about lack of information, but rather it's the author making an issue out of it. the use of ""whining"" is particularly telling, as it's a dismissive way to characterize the author's concerns.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is mostly neutral with some negative elements, the true intention is more critical. the speaker is using a matter-of-fact tone to present information that contradicts the article's implications. the use of ""whining"" adds a sarcastic edge to the criticism. 

however, while there's criticism and a hint of sarcasm in the use of ""whining,"" the overall statement doesn't strongly rely on irony or saying the opposite of what's meant. the criticism is relatively direct.

given this analysis, i would classify this as:

label: not sarcastic

the statement contains criticism and a hint of mockery, but it doesn't rely heavily on irony or saying the opposite of what's meant, which are key components of sarcasm.",0
"Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there.",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:

- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:

Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","i will think through this step-by-step, as there are multiple layers to unpack in this text.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed and somewhat negative. key phrases like ""oh yeah, like that hasn't been tried before /sarcasm"" and ""no doubt some nefarious excuse"" indicate skepticism and criticism. the tone seems frustrated and dismissive towards certain policies or proposals.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be a sarcastic critique of gun control measures in california. the author is using exaggeration and mock predictions to criticize these policies. for example:
- ""/sarcasm"" is explicitly used to denote sarcasm
- ""no doubt sinjin will approve..."" is likely a mocking prediction
- ""the early birds get the worm"" is used sarcastically to imply negative consequences
- ""wa wa wa wa wa!"" mimics crying to mock potential future complaints

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, it's clear that the surface negativity aligns with a deeper sarcastic intent. the author uses various sarcastic devices throughout the text to express their disagreement with gun control measures. the explicit use of ""/sarcasm"", exaggerated predictions, and mocking language all contribute to an overall sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, the final label is:

Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive and somewhat confused. the text contains several questions, seeking clarification on legal, constitutional, and theological matters. the tone seems polite, ending with ""thanks"".

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are hints of skepticism and challenge in the questions:
- ""also, how can god hate? i thought he was true love."" this juxtaposition implies skepticism about the concept of a loving god who can also hate.
- ""scratch that-- i thought he was unknowable."" this sudden contradiction suggests the author is pointing out inconsistencies in religious beliefs.
the questions seem designed to highlight logical inconsistencies rather than genuinely seek information.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface tone is polite and inquisitive, the underlying intention appears to be to challenge and critique religious beliefs and their impact on legal matters. the contrast between the seemingly sincere questions and the implied criticism suggests a sarcastic tone, especially in the theological questions. the abrupt ""scratch that"" followed by another contradictory statement emphasizes this sarcastic intent.

step 2: true intention
the true intention aligns closely with the surface sentiment. the author is criticizing both a specific person's lack of education and the broader creationist movement. the use of ""well maybe that will teach him"" has a slightly mocking tone. the author is openly accusing creationists of dishonesty and deliberately spreading misinformation.

step 3: comparison and analysis

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems playful and humorous. the phrase ""a waist is a terrible thing to mind"" is a clever wordplay on the common saying ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be making a joke about indulging in food during feasts. by saying ""a waist is a terrible thing to mind,"" the speaker is suggesting that during feasts, one shouldn't worry about their waistline or weight gain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface playfulness aligns with the true intention of making a humorous comment about feasting. the wordplay is clever but not used to convey an opposite meaning or criticism. instead, it's used to make a lighthearted joke about enjoying food without worrying about weight gain during festive occasions.

based on this analysis, while the statement is witty and contains wordplay, it doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the humor is straightforward rather than saying one thing while meaning the opposite.

the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and somewhat critical. the phrase ""full of fear and mistrust"" suggests a negative characterization. the overall tone seems confrontational, challenging the consistency of a particular group's beliefs and actions.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to point out the irony or hypocrisy in the position of gun advocates. by framing their stance as one of fear (needing guns for protection or revolution) and then highlighting that they accuse others of being fearful, the author is attempting to expose a contradiction. the use of quotation marks around ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" suggests mockery of this justification.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface questioning actually masks a deeper criticism. the author is not genuinely asking a question but rather using a rhetorical question to make a point. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to this question - that it's absurd for people who arm themselves out of fear to accuse others of being fearful. the juxtaposition of the gun owners' actions (arming themselves) with their accusations towards others (being full of fear) creates a sarcastic tone that undermines their position.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### label: sarcastic",1
"Less than a playstation, of course!",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

        ","given the limited context and brevity of the statement ""less than a playstation, of course!"", i'll analyze it step-by-step to determine if it's sarcastic:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears straightforward and matter-of-fact. the phrase ""of course!"" suggests certainty or obviousness about something being less than a playstation.

step 2 (true intention):
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention. however, the use of ""of course!"" can sometimes indicate sarcasm, especially if the statement is meant to be absurd or contrary to expectations.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the potential for sarcasm lies in the contrast between the straightforward surface sentiment and the possibility that the statement is meant to be absurd or ironic. however, without additional context, it's challenging to confidently determine if this is sarcastic or simply a factual statement.

given the ambiguity and lack of context, i cannot confidently classify this statement as either sarcastic or not sarcastic. more information about the topic of discussion and the tone of the conversation would be needed for a more accurate assessment.",0

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis

- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step as it's a complex text with multiple points:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be defensive and argumentative. the author is responding to various points, often with a dismissive or confrontational tone. there are no obvious sarcastic markers like exaggerated praise or agreement.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to defend a christian, creationist perspective against perceived attacks from atheists and evolutionary theorists. the author is genuinely expressing disagreement and frustration with opposing viewpoints, rather than using irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there's no significant mismatch that would indicate sarcasm. the author's argumentative tone and direct criticisms are consistent with their apparent beliefs and intentions. while some phrases might be seen as rhetorically charged (e.g., ""i've seen it all now""), they don't rise to the level of sarcasm but rather express genuine frustration or disbelief.

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears mixed:
- positive/enthusiastic: ""most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment""
- curious/anticipatory: ""so when are you going to...""
- seemingly respectful: ""you don't seriously propose...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- ""that is the argument that one hears from creationists so often"" implies criticism of creationist arguments
- ""expose the theory of evolution"" suggests the author doesn't actually believe evolution needs exposing
- ""your little series of cow pies"" is a clear insult, indicating the author finds the opponent's arguments worthless
- the final rhetorical question ""you don't seriously propose... is actually meaningful, do you?"" implies strong disagreement

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface enthusiasm and curiosity contrasts sharply with the underlying criticism and dismissal
- the seemingly polite phrasing of the final question is undermined by the insulting ""cow pies"" metaphor
- the overall tone is mocking, using false enthusiasm to highlight perceived flaws in the opponent's argument

given this analysis, the text is clearly using sarcasm to criticize and mock creationist arguments.

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

i'm confident in this judgment, but let me break it down to explain why:

1. surface sentiment: the opening question ""prove something besides your ignorance?"" is overtly critical and confrontational. the text then provides factual information about differences between homo erectus and neanderthals. the closing sentence ""i can see why people are laughing at you"" is openly mocking.

2. true intention: the author is using a combination of rhetorical questioning, presenting scientific facts, and direct mockery to criticize the person they're addressing. the implication is that the other person is ignorant of basic scientific facts and is therefore worthy of ridicule.

3. comparison and analysis: the sarcasm lies in the contrast between the seemingly objective presentation of scientific facts and the bookending insults. the author is not genuinely asking for proof or trying to educate, but rather using this information to highlight the perceived ignorance of the other person.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive and encouraging. it starts with ""i see"" and suggests the other person wants to explore evolution. it uses phrases like ""great"" and asks why the person is ""more reasonable and not so dumb."" however, it also includes confrontational language like ""unreasonable and dumb arguments"" and ""do you have a pair?""

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to challenge and criticize the other person's position. the author is using rhetorical questions and exaggerated examples (invisible pink unicorns) to undermine the other person's credibility. the seemingly encouraging language is actually mocking, implying that the other person hasn't presented any valid arguments.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the surface encouragement (""great. then start..."") and the underlying criticism. the use of absurd examples and confrontational language reveals that the author is not genuinely interested in the other person's exploration of evolution. the question ""do you have a pair?"" is particularly sarcastic, implying the other person lacks courage or substance in their arguments.

Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and defensive. the opening line ""sure let me have your sermon/propaganda of misinformation"" sets a hostile tone. the text then provides dictionary definitions, seemingly to educate or correct the other party. the biblical quote at the end appears to be used as evidence to support the author's point.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to mock and discredit the opponent's argument. the use of dictionary definitions is likely not for genuine education, but to imply the opponent doesn't understand basic concepts. the biblical quote is used to assert that wisdom doesn't necessarily come with age, implying the opponent's experience doesn't make them correct.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the seemingly educational tone (providing definitions and biblical quotes) is actually used sarcastically to undermine the opponent's credibility. the opening line, ""sure let me have your sermon/propaganda of misinformation,"" is clearly sarcastic, setting the tone for the entire response.

Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the word ""informative"" is generally used to praise something for being useful or educational.

step 2: true intention
despite the positive word choice, the brevity of the statement and the use of ""how"" as an exclamation suggest that the true intention may be the opposite. it's likely that the speaker found the information not informative at all and is expressing disappointment or frustration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contradiction between the surface positive sentiment and the likely negative true intention. the use of a single word with a positive connotation to express a negative sentiment is a common sarcastic technique. the brevity of the statement further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of genuine curiosity and confusion. the phrase ""wonder what..."" suggests a sincere inquiry, and ""never heard of it before"" reinforces the idea of unfamiliarity.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention becomes clear when we consider:
1. ""euthanization"" is a well-known term, especially in discussions about animal welfare or end-of-life care.
2. the claim that it's not in the dictionary is likely false, as it's a common enough word to be included in most dictionaries.
3. the quotation marks around ""euthanization"" suggest skepticism or mockery.

the speaker is likely feigning ignorance to make a point, possibly criticizing the use of euphemisms for killing or expressing disagreement with the concept.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface curiosity and the likely intention of mocking or criticizing. the speaker is using verbal irony by pretending not to know a common term and even claiming it's not in the dictionary. this exaggeration further reinforces the sarcastic tone.

given this analysis, the final label is:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""oxymoron"" and ""military intelligence"" suggest skepticism towards the concept of reasonable gun regulation. the mention of specific individuals (bill ayers, carl rowen) and ""wait my bad"" indicate a conversational tone with an apparent self-correction.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be critiquing both gun regulation and perceived hypocrisy in political discourse. the comparison to ""military intelligence"" implies that the speaker believes ""reasonable gun regulation"" is inherently contradictory. the references to ayers and rowen, followed by ""wait my bad they aren't from the right,"" suggest the speaker is pointing out what they see as inconsistency in how violent actions are perceived based on political affiliation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying intention, but the delivery is heavy with sarcasm. the ""oxymoron"" comparison, the rhetorical question ""you mean like..."", and the feigned self-correction ""wait my bad"" are all classic sarcastic devices. the speaker is using irony to mock both the concept of gun regulation and perceived double standards in political discourse.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is not to genuinely ask a question, but to criticize and mock the anti-abortion stance. the use of extreme language like ""re-education jails"" and the rhetorical question format suggest that the author is using hyperbole to highlight what they see as the absurdity of the anti-abortion position.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be a series of questions, the true intention is to sarcastically criticize the anti-abortion stance. the exaggerated scenario of ""re-education jails"" and the implication that believing a fertilized egg is a human being requires forced re-education are clear indicators of sarcasm. the author is using these extreme examples to mock and discredit the opposing viewpoint.

        ","i think i should analyze this step-by-step to be more confident in the classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward question about belief in greek gods. there are no overtly sarcastic keywords, emotional phrases, or emojis. the tone seems neutral and inquiring.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely not to genuinely ask about belief in greek gods. instead, it seems to be a rhetorical question aimed at highlighting the perceived absurdity of believing in any gods. by specifically mentioning zeus and greek gods, which are widely considered mythological in modern times, the speaker is likely drawing a parallel to other religious beliefs.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a disconnect between the surface-level innocent question and the underlying implication. the question is not meant to be answered literally, but rather to provoke thought about the validity of religious beliefs in general. this use of a rhetorical question to make a point about religious skepticism indicates sarcasm.

based on this analysis, i can confidently classify this as:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly critical. the phrase ""and yet"" suggests a contrast or contradiction. the statement is factual about the dunblane handgun ban occurring after a single event. there are no overtly emotional words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be critical or skeptical of gun control policies or their inconsistent application. by pointing out that a significant policy change (handgun ban) occurred after just one event (dunblane), the speaker may be implying that similar actions should be taken in other contexts, or questioning why such swift action isn't taken in other situations.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is relatively neutral, the underlying intention appears to be making a point about policy inconsistency or criticizing inaction in other contexts. however, this criticism is subtle and implied rather than overtly stated. the statement doesn't employ typical sarcastic structures like exaggeration or mock praise. it's more of a pointed observation than a sarcastic comment.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is not sarcastic, but rather a critical observation made in a straightforward manner.

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

        ","since this is a very short and ambiguous statement, i'll think through it step-by-step to analyze it more carefully:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. ""yes"" is an affirmative response, and ""have you?"" is a polite reciprocal question.

step 2: true intention
without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden intention. the brevity could suggest impatience or dismissiveness, but it could also be a genuine question. the true intention is unclear from this short exchange alone.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't enough information to confidently identify a mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention. the statement could be sincere or sarcastic depending on the context and tone in which it's delivered.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the ambiguity of the statement, i cannot confidently label this as sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat surprised, starting with ""oh!"" and providing a link to a news article. it seems to be comparing gun violence in france to that in america, suggesting that french criminals use more powerful weapons.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh!"" is likely used sarcastically to feign surprise.
- the phrase ""gun free france"" is repeated, emphasizing the contradiction between this label and the violent incident described.
- calling machine guns ""for sissy american felons"" is clearly hyperbolic and mocking.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears straightforward and neutral. it's a statement about learning something in a health class, which on its own doesn't carry strong positive or negative connotations. the capitalization of ""did"" adds emphasis, suggesting certainty or insistence.

step 2: true intention
the emphasis on ""did"" combined with the topic of ""selective hearing"" suggests a deeper meaning. the speaker is likely implying that while they learned about selective hearing, someone else is exhibiting this behavior - i.e., choosing to hear only what they want to hear. this could be a subtle accusation or criticism directed at someone who isn't listening or is ignoring certain information.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a discrepancy between the surface-level statement about a class lesson and the implied criticism. the use of ""selective hearing"" as both the literal subject learned and a metaphorical description of someone's behavior creates a clever wordplay. this dual meaning, combined with the emphatic ""did,"" strongly suggests sarcasm.

upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be giving advice or a recommendation, as indicated by the phrase ""you should refrain from"". the tone seems polite and formal with the use of ""mr.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we consider the phrase ""mr. kettle"". this is likely a reference to the idiom ""the pot calling the kettle black"", which is used to describe someone criticizing another for a fault they themselves have. by addressing the person as ""mr. kettle"", the speaker is implying that the person they're addressing is guilty of the very thing they're criticizing others for - in this case, arrogance.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (giving polite advice) and the true intention (pointing out hypocrisy). the use of the ""kettle"" reference is a subtle but pointed way of calling out the person's own arrogance while pretending to give them advice. this ironic contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently say:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as it requires some careful consideration:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is neutral. it's a simple question asking what jesus would carry, without any obvious positive or negative connotations. there are no emojis or clearly sentimental words.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be making a play on words, referencing the common phrase ""what would jesus do?"" (wwjd) but replacing ""do"" with ""carry."" this likely alludes to the debate around gun rights and gun control in the united states, implying a question about whether jesus would carry a weapon.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface question seems straightforward, the underlying intention is to provoke thought or debate by juxtaposing the peaceful image of jesus with the contentious topic of gun ownership. the use of jesus' name in this context, especially when discussing weapons, creates an ironic contrast that suggests sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe the statement is intended to be sarcastic. it uses a familiar religious phrase in an unexpected context to make a point about a controversial political issue.

the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough evaluation:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and somewhat confrontational. key phrases like ""it's obvious"" and ""nothing will ever change your mind"" suggest frustration and a negative attitude towards the addressees (""you guys""). the tone seems accusatory, implying closed-mindedness in the target group.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock evolutionists or those who accept darwinian theory. the author is using irony to suggest that evolutionists are actually the closed-minded ones, despite their claims of following evidence. the statement about minds being made up based on worldview and materialism is meant to accuse evolutionists of the very bias they often attribute to their opponents.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface criticism and the underlying mockery. the author is using verbal irony to flip the common accusation of closed-mindedness back onto evolutionists. the exaggerated certainty (""it's obvious"", ""nothing will ever change your mind"") and the accusation of predetermined conclusions based on worldview rather than evidence are hallmarks of sarcastic rhetoric.

i'm highly confident in this classification, but i'll walk through my thought process:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and agreeable, with phrases like ""yep"" and ""always the way to go"" suggesting approval of suppressing natural behavior.

step 2: the true intention is clearly the opposite. the author is using exaggeration and absurdity (comparing natural behavior to pooping) to mock the idea of suppressing natural behavior.

step 3: the stark contrast between the superficially positive language and the absurd suggestion reveals clear sarcasm. the author is using irony to criticize the idea of suppressing natural behavior by taking it to an ridiculous extreme.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the text provides a link to a new york times article, suggesting an informative tone. however, the phrase ""who gives a damn?"" indicates frustration or indifference.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we analyze the full context:
- ""but they are not fetuses, alas"" implies a criticism of how society values fetuses more than other groups.
- ""so who gives a damn?"" is a rhetorical question suggesting that people don't care about the subject of the article (likely orphans, based on the url) because they're not fetuses.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral link sharing and the biting commentary that follows indicates sarcasm. the author is using verbal irony to criticize what they perceive as misplaced societal priorities, comparing concern for fetuses with apparent lack of concern for orphans.

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears enthusiastic and agreeable at first, with exclamations like ""oh! i get it!"" suggesting a sudden understanding. the phrase ""abortion is fun"" seems to present a positive view of abortion.

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the claim that ""abortion is fun"" is highly unlikely to be sincere, given the sensitive nature of the topic.
- the parenthetical ""(to kill your unborn son/daughter)"" presents abortion in a very negative light.
- putting ""unbalanced"" in quotes suggests the writer is mocking the idea that only mentally unstable women find abortion traumatic.
- the overall tone is actually critical and dismissive of those who might downplay the emotional impact of abortion.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the enthusiastic surface tone (""oh! i get it!"") and the claim that ""abortion is fun"" sharply contradict the true intention, which is to criticize those who minimize the emotional toll of abortion. the use of quotation marks around ""unbalanced"" further emphasizes the sarcastic nature of the statement. the contrast between the seemingly positive opening and the clearly negative framing of abortion creates a strong sarcastic effect.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. the phrase ""if you value science and common sense"" suggests a positive stance towards these concepts. however, the statement that ""science and common sense are irrelevant in their world"" implies a negative view of the opposing group.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock a group of people who supposedly disregard science and common sense. the author is using a rhetorical device to emphasize the perceived irrationality of the group they're referring to. the phrase ""in their world"" further emphasizes the author's belief that this group lives in a separate reality.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear contrast between the implied value of science and common sense and the alleged disregard for these concepts by the group being criticized. the author uses this contrast to create a sarcastic tone. the statement isn't merely critical; it's using irony to mock the group's perceived rejection of rationality.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and challenging. key phrases like ""it's your job to prove it correct"", ""show us"", and ""shut up"" indicate an aggressive tone. the repetition of ""show us"" emphasizes this demanding attitude.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to mock and discredit the opponent's stance. the use of the phrase ""thimble head"" is particularly telling - it's a derogatory term implying the opponent has a small mind or limited intelligence. the repeated demands to ""show us"" are likely not genuine requests for information, but rather a rhetorical device to highlight the perceived impossibility of proving the opponent's point.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is confrontational, the true intention goes beyond mere disagreement into the realm of mockery and sarcasm. the use of the insulting term ""thimble head"", the repetitive structure, and the final ""show us or shut up"" all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the opponent's position while feigning a demand for proof.

        ### Label: 

        ","i will think through this step-by-step, as the sentence lacks clear contextual cues for sarcasm:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward, neutral question. there are no obvious emotional keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis. the question simply asks about positioning relative to a leaf.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine if there's a hidden meaning or true intention beyond the surface question. the question could be literal, or it could be a playful or sarcastic comment about something being very small or hard to see. however, there's not enough information to confidently infer any alternative intention.

step 3: comparison and analysis
given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the absence of context that might suggest a hidden meaning, it's safest to interpret this as a literal question. while sarcasm is possible, there's not enough evidence to confidently label it as such.

based on this analysis, i would classify this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, i want to note that with additional context, this classification could potentially change.",0

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a serious, logical statement. it references spock, a character known for his logic, and uses the phrase ""logic dictates,"" which seems to set up a rational argument.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the statement contains a paradox. it claims that logic dictates that logic need not apply. this is a self-contradictory statement, as logic is being used to argue against the use of logic. the true intention appears to be highlighting the absurdity or limitations of always applying strict logic.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly logical setup (invoking spock and using formal language like ""logic dictates"") and the paradoxical conclusion creates a humorous effect. the statement uses the form of a logical argument to make an illogical point, which is a classic sarcastic technique.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of sudden understanding or realization, indicated by the phrase ""oh, i get it?"" this is followed by a statement that attributes human-like qualities (souls and consciousness) to inanimate objects (flashlights and ipods).

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely to mock or ridicule an idea or argument that the speaker disagrees with. by suggesting that everyday electronic devices have souls and consciousness, the speaker is using hyperbole to highlight the perceived absurdity of whatever idea they're responding to. the use of a rhetorical question (""oh, i get it?"") further emphasizes the speaker's disbelief and disagreement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment of realization with the true intention of mockery, it becomes clear that this statement is sarcastic. the speaker is not actually claiming to understand or believe that flashlights and ipods have souls and consciousness. instead, they are using exaggeration and rhetorical devices to sarcastically criticize an idea or argument they find illogical or ridiculous.

the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of genuine inquiry. the word ""really"" could indicate surprise or interest. the question ""have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?"" seems to be a straightforward request for evidence.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, the true intention seems to be skeptical or challenging:
- the ""really"" at the beginning likely expresses doubt rather than genuine surprise.
- the question about quotes is likely rhetorical, implying that such quotes don't exist.
- the use of ""endorsing monopolies"" suggests the speaker believes this would be an unlikely or unpopular stance.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface-level inquiry and the underlying skepticism. the seemingly straightforward question is actually a challenge to the previous statement or claim. the speaker is using a rhetorical question to express disbelief and potentially mock the idea that the group in question would support monopolies.

given this analysis, the statement appears to be sarcastic. the speaker is using a seemingly innocent question to convey skepticism and possibly ridicule the opposing viewpoint.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

        ","let's think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be confrontational and critical. the text starts with a rhetorical question ""so you're a historian now?"" which sets a skeptical tone. the rest of the text seems to be presenting historical facts and arguments in a direct manner.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to challenge and criticize the knowledge and arguments of another person. the rhetorical question at the beginning implies that the other person is not qualified to make historical claims. the author then proceeds to present counter-arguments and historical facts, suggesting that the other person's understanding is flawed or incomplete.

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing steps 1 and 2, we can see that the surface sentiment aligns closely with the true intention. the text is direct in its criticism and doesn't employ irony or say the opposite of what is meant. the confrontational tone is consistent throughout, and the arguments are presented straightforwardly.

given this analysis, i can conclude with high confidence that this text is not sarcastic. it's confrontational and critical, but it doesn't use irony or say the opposite of what is meant, which are key components of sarcasm.

the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ","let's approach this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears somewhat critical or accusatory. the phrase ""you've done the 'name calling'"" suggests disapproval of the other person's actions. the statement ""at least you could be honest"" implies that the speaker believes the other person is being dishonest or evasive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be calling out perceived hypocrisy or dishonesty. the speaker is urging the other person to acknowledge their actions (""be honest about what you are doing""). the use of quotation marks around 'name calling' suggests that this is a term or accusation that has been previously discussed or disputed.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there is a critical tone, the statement doesn't appear to use irony or say the opposite of what is meant, which are key components of sarcasm. the speaker seems to be directly expressing their frustration and calling for honesty, rather than using sarcasm to make their point.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

label: not sarcastic

the statement is critical and confrontational, but it doesn't employ sarcasm to convey its message. it's a direct call-out rather than an ironic or sarcastic comment.",0

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:

- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears frustrated and critical. key phrases like ""you complain about the responses we give"" and the comparison to people with down syndrome suggest irritation and a harsh judgment of the person being addressed.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to insult and mock the person being addressed. the rhetorical question ""what is the scoop here?"" implies exasperation. the comparison to people with down syndrome learning not to touch flames is particularly biting, suggesting the addressee is behaving in a way that's perceived as unintelligent or stubbornly self-destructive.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is critical, the true intention goes beyond mere criticism into sarcasm. the use of the rhetorical question, the exaggerated comparison, and the overall tone of mock bewilderment at the addressee's behavior all contribute to a sarcastic message. the speaker is not genuinely asking for information or offering constructive criticism, but rather using biting humor to express frustration and ridicule.

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and conciliatory. the phrase ""i guess you're right though, ss"" seems to indicate agreement with a previous statement. the tone appears neutral to slightly positive.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination, the true intention appears to be sarcastic and critical:
- the first sentence defends the theory of evolution (toe) against accusations of promoting negative ideologies.
- the phrase ""i guess you're right though"" is likely insincere, given the context.
- the comment about ""out-of-context quotes"" criticizes a method of argument, implying it's a less valid approach.
- the use of ""entertaining"" in this context is likely ironic, suggesting that such arguments are not actually entertaining or valuable.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface agreement and the underlying criticism. the seemingly agreeable tone in the second part contradicts the defense of toe in the first part. the sarcasm is evident in the mock agreement and the ironic use of ""entertaining"" to describe an argument style the author clearly disapproves of.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears earnest and concerned. the speaker expresses belief in social responsibility and concern for fellow americans facing economic hardships. the questions seem to be seeking genuine solutions.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the true intention seems to be criticism of an unstated opposing view. the final question ""just drop dead?"" is clearly rhetorical and implies that the unstated opposing view is callous or unrealistic. this suggests the speaker is using these questions to highlight the perceived inadequacy of alternative approaches.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the initial statements appear sincere, the final rhetorical question reveals a sarcastic tone. the speaker is not actually suggesting that people should ""drop dead,"" but rather using this extreme statement to criticize those who might oppose social support systems. the contrast between the seemingly earnest opening and the sharp, sarcastic closing question indicates that the overall intent is sarcastic.

label: sarcastic

the presence of the rhetorical question and the implied criticism of unstated views leads me to conclude that this statement is indeed sarcastic, despite its initial appearance of sincerity.",1
"But what if it is unconstitutional, like Prop. 8?   No, it doesn't.   Are you saying homosexuals aren't American? Are you saying that more of gay's right should be stripped, including that of protest? How dare them fight for their own freedoms? I should lend you my time machine, and you should go tell this to Malcom X.   And you still haven't responded to my post.",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

        ### Label: 

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears confrontational and defensive. the text uses rhetorical questions and strong language (""how dare them"", ""are you saying..."") that suggest indignation. the reference to malcolm x implies a serious discussion about civil rights.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to challenge and criticize the opposing viewpoint. the series of rhetorical questions are not seeking genuine answers but are used to point out perceived flaws in the other person's argument. the mention of a time machine and malcolm x is likely hyperbole used to emphasize the perceived backwardness of the opposing view.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is confrontational, the true intention aligns with this confrontational tone. the rhetorical devices (rhetorical questions, hyperbole) are used to strengthen the argument rather than to convey an opposite meaning. the text appears to be a genuine, albeit heated, argument rather than a sarcastic response.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be presenting a constructive suggestion, indicated by phrases like ""here's a novel idea"" and ""just a thought."" the tone seems helpful and solution-oriented.

step 2: true intention
upon closer examination:
- ""here's a novel idea"" is likely sarcastic, implying this is actually an obvious solution.
- the parenthetical ""(scientifically unproven)"" criticizes abstinence programs.
- ""just a thought"" at the end downplays the suggestion, which is actually a strong criticism of current practices.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface tone of helpfulness contrasts sharply with the underlying criticism. the use of seemingly polite phrases to frame a pointed critique of right-wing policies indicates sarcasm. the author is not genuinely offering a ""novel idea"" but rather pointing out what they see as an obvious flaw in current approaches.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears strongly negative towards liberal democrats. the phrase ""murdering innocent children"" is extremely emotionally charged and accusatory.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely to criticize liberal democrats' stance on abortion rights. however, the extreme language (""murdering innocent children"") is an exaggeration that misrepresents the pro-choice position. this hyperbole suggests the statement is not meant to be taken literally.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface accusation is so extreme that it undermines its own credibility. the use of ""and yet"" at the beginning implies a contrast with some unstated previous point, further suggesting this is part of a rhetorical argument rather than a sincere belief. the exaggeration and implied contrast are hallmarks of sarcasm, used here to mock and criticize the pro-choice stance of many liberal democrats.

the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

there's a clear mismatch between the surface agreement and amusement in step 1 and the underlying mockery in step 2. the use of exaggeration, absurd suggestions, and the rhetorical question all contribute to a sarcastic tone. the comment is actually criticizing the idea of undermining scientific theories by labeling them as ""just theories,"" while pretending to agree with such an idea.

based on this analysis, the label is clearly sarcastic.

"What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want.",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be stating factual information about unicorns, their abilities, and characteristics. the tone seems matter-of-fact.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock or ridicule an argument by using an absurd comparison. unicorns are mythical creatures, and the attributes described (breathing toxic gas, having low density) are nonsensical. this is likely a response to an earlier argument, implying that the original point was as ridiculous as these claims about unicorns.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a stark contrast between the seemingly straightforward surface statement and the absurd content. the use of mythical creatures and impossible attributes to make a point is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the phrase ""what's your point?"" at the beginning further reinforces the sarcastic tone, implying that the following statement is meant to highlight the perceived absurdity of the original argument.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as sarcastic.

Who is killing children?   Except for George Bush who has seen to the killing of thousands of children in Iraq.,1,"
### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine question followed by a factual statement. the first part ""who is killing children?"" seems to express concern or outrage. the second part presents george bush as an exception, stating he has ""seen to the killing of thousands of children in iraq.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticism of george bush and possibly broader us foreign policy. the initial question is likely rhetorical, set up to emphasize the statement about bush. the phrase ""seen to the killing"" implies intentionality and responsibility, which is a harsh accusation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly innocent initial question and the stark accusation against bush creates a sarcastic tone. the author is not genuinely asking who is killing children, but rather using this question to set up a pointed criticism. the sarcasm lies in the implication that while people might be concerned about child killers in general, they're overlooking a major perpetrator (in the author's view).

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

### Example:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

the surface sentiment appears positive and lighthearted. the phrase ""real comedy"" suggests enjoyment and humor, implying that the comments section is genuinely funny and entertaining.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is likely more cynical. by saying the ""real comedy"" is in the comments, the speaker implies that the original content is less amusing than the often chaotic, argumentative, or absurd nature of comment sections. this suggests that the entertainment comes from the potentially negative or ridiculous aspects of user comments rather than from intentional comedy.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be mocking and criticizing both spam&scram and creationists in general. the author is pointing out inconsistencies in spam&scram's stance, comparing them unfavorably to typical creationist behavior, and suggesting amusement at the potential conflict between spam&scram and other creationists.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface bewilderment and the underlying mockery. the author uses irony to highlight the perceived absurdity of spam&scram's position. the parenthetical comment directly introduces sarcasm by sarcastically agreeing that claiming to know everything despite professing ignorance is typical creationist behavior. the final sentence, while seemingly neutral, carries an implication of anticipated amusement at potential conflict, further reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Well all you have to do is tell us the minimum time during which it could happen by NDS theory and then how long it actually took and we can compare the numbers. Of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers. Enjoy

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ","i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""all you have to do"" suggests a simple task. the ""enjoy"" at the end could be read as encouragement.

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the task described is actually quite complex and demanding, requiring detailed calculations and explanations.
- ""of course you will have to detail..."" implies an expectation of failure or inability to provide such information.
- ""enjoy"" at the end, given the complexity of the task, likely indicates mockery rather than genuine encouragement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the seemingly simple request on the surface and the actually complex, likely impossible task being demanded. the casual tone and ""enjoy"" at the end further emphasize this contrast, implying the speaker doesn't actually expect the task to be completed. this use of verbal irony strongly indicates sarcasm.

given this analysis, i can confidently provide the label:

### label: sarcastic",1
"Oh my stars and garters.   He actually admitted what ""the real issue"" is.",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a confident classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise and excitement, as indicated by the exclamation ""oh my stars and garters."" this old-fashioned expression typically conveys astonishment or shock. the second sentence seems to express a straightforward observation about someone admitting to ""the real issue.""

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely mockery or criticism. the use of an exaggerated, outdated expression (""oh my stars and garters"") suggests insincerity. the phrase ""he actually admitted"" implies that this admission was unexpected or unusual, potentially highlighting the speaker's skepticism or criticism of the person being discussed. the quotation marks around ""the real issue"" further suggest that the speaker doubts or disagrees with what was admitted.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly surprised and excited surface sentiment and the underlying critical or mocking intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the exaggerated language and implied criticism through word choice and punctuation reinforce this interpretation.

"hey, watch yourself.........watch it..",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears to be a warning or caution. the repetition of ""watch"" and use of multiple periods creates a sense of urgency or emphasis. the phrase ""hey"" at the beginning adds a casual, attention-grabbing tone.

step 2 (true intention):
it's difficult to determine the true intention without more context. this could be:
1. a genuine warning about physical danger
2. a playful teasing between friends
3. a sarcastic comment implying the opposite of caution (e.g., in response to someone being overly careful)

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
given the limited context, there's not enough evidence to confidently label this as sarcastic. the surface warning could align with the true intention. while the repetition and ellipsis might suggest emphasis that could be interpreted as sarcastic in certain contexts, it's not definitive.

without more context to clearly indicate a mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention, i cannot confidently label this as sarcastic.

i'm confident in this assessment, as the text is replete with sarcastic and mocking comments directed at ""marc."" the author uses rhetorical questions, exaggeration, and irony throughout to criticize marc's arguments and interpretations. examples include:

""yeesh. even when i spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.""
""marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again.""
""i keep forgetting that your persecution switch is fused in the 'on' position.""
""pathetic, marc. absolutely, positively pathetic.""

the overall tone is dismissive and mocking, using sarcasm as a rhetorical tool to undermine marc's position and highlight perceived flaws in his reasoning.",1

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and skeptical. the opening question ""and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars?"" sets a tone of doubt. the text criticizes the methodology of studies on gay men, questioning their validity and representativeness.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to challenge the credibility of studies about gay men and highlight the importance of proper statistical sampling. the author is making a serious point about the difficulty of obtaining accurate data on hidden populations and the potential for bias in studies depending on where participants are recruited.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the opening question has a sarcastic tone, the rest of the text is a straightforward critique of research methods. the author uses examples (bars, bathhouses) to illustrate how sample selection can skew results, but these are used to make a genuine point rather than for sarcastic effect. the emphasis on ""random samples"" at the end reinforces the serious nature of the argument.

given this analysis, while there are elements of sarcasm (particularly in the opening question), the overall intent of the text is to make a sincere argument about research methodology. the sarcastic elements serve to emphasize the point rather than to convey an opposite meaning.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

- ""they're delicious!"" sounds like high praise, using an exclamation mark for emphasis

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""don't get me wrong"" often precedes a statement that contradicts expectations
- calling babies ""delicious"" is highly unusual and disturbing if taken literally
- this combination creates a shocking juxtaposition between loving babies and considering them food

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface positivity sharply contrasts with the disturbing implication of eating babies
- this extreme mismatch between loving babies and viewing them as food is clearly not meant literally
- the statement uses dark humor to create a sarcastic effect, likely mocking overly enthusiastic statements about loving babies

given this analysis, the statement is clearly using sarcasm for shock value and humor.

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: the surface sentiment appears positive and agreeable. the phrase ""hit that one right on the head"" is an idiom expressing strong agreement or accuracy. the statement ""i'd like to hear supersport's response to this"" seems to show interest in further discussion.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention may be more complex:
- ""hit that one right on the head"" could be an exaggeration, potentially indicating sarcasm.
- directly addressing ""symbiote"" and mentioning ""supersport"" suggests this is part of an ongoing discussion or debate.
- the eagerness to hear supersport's response might be genuine curiosity, or it could be a challenge, implying that supersport will struggle to counter the point made.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, there's ambiguity in the true intention. while the surface sentiment is clearly positive, the underlying tone could be either genuinely approving or subtly mocking. without more context about the ongoing discussion and the usual communication style of the participants, it's difficult to definitively label this as sarcastic.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing surprise or mild disappointment. the phrase ""from the title, i was sure"" implies an expectation that wasn't met. the mention of the ""bible fish"" (likely referring to the babel fish from the book) suggests the commenter had a specific expectation based on the title that wasn't fulfilled.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying intention reveals a hint of irony. the commenter's expectation was subverted, which is often a setup for sarcastic comments. however, the tone doesn't seem overtly mocking or critical, and there's no clear exaggeration or verbal irony that would strongly indicate sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","to ensure a thorough analysis, i'll think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of uncertainty and doubt. the repeated use of short, emphatic sentences emphasizes this feeling. the phrases ""aren't sure,"" ""don't know,"" and ""didn't 'prove' anything"" all express a lack of certainty or conclusive evidence.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mockery or criticism. the repetitive structure and exaggerated emphasis on uncertainty suggest that the speaker is not genuinely expressing doubt, but rather ridiculing someone else's lack of certainty or proof. the use of quotation marks around ""prove"" further implies skepticism about the validity of any proof that might be offered.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface expression of uncertainty and the underlying tone of mockery. the exaggerated repetition and emphatic style are hallmarks of sarcasm, used here to criticize someone's lack of definitive evidence or certainty. the speaker is likely not actually concerned about the lack of proof, but is instead using this exaggerated language to make a point about the absurdity of the situation or argument they're addressing.

based on this analysis, the final label is:

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a suggestion for enhancing presidential security. it proposes arming the audience at presidential speeches to counter potential assassination attempts. the tone seems matter-of-fact and solution-oriented.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely to criticize overzealous gun rights advocacy or extreme security measures. by suggesting an absurd and dangerous scenario (arming a crowd at a presidential event), the speaker is using hyperbole to highlight the perceived ridiculousness of certain pro-gun arguments or excessive security protocols.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly straightforward suggestion in step 1 and the absurd, impractical, and dangerous nature of the proposal revealed in step 2 strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using irony to make a point about gun control or security measures, not genuinely proposing this as a solution.

given this analysis, i can confidently conclude:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

        ### Label: 

        ","i will think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. the phrase ""you forgot one"" suggests the speaker is adding to a list of negative points. the mention of eugenics and the derogatory term ""poor negros"" in quotes indicate a highly controversial and sensitive topic. the final rhetorical question ""we wouldn't want those 'poor negros' reproducing now would we?"" seems to express a racist sentiment.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely the opposite of the surface sentiment. the speaker is almost certainly not advocating for eugenics or expressing racist views. instead, they are using extreme language and a rhetorical question to highlight and criticize historical attempts to implement eugenics and racist policies in the us. the use of quotation marks around ""poor negros"" further indicates that the speaker is not endorsing this language, but rather quoting or mimicking those who would use such terms.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the stark contrast between the surface sentiment (seemingly racist and pro-eugenics) and the true intention (criticizing racism and eugenics) strongly indicates sarcasm. the use of exaggeration, rhetorical questioning, and mimicry of racist language are all common sarcastic techniques used to emphasize the absurdity and immorality of the ideas being criticized.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning, as indicated by the phrase ""so what are you trying to do here"". the use of the term ""bafflegab"" suggests confusion or criticism.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of this sentence is to criticize or mock the person being addressed. ""bafflegab"" is a term for confusing or wordy jargon used to obscure the truth or confuse people. by asking if the person is trying to ""smother everyone with bafflegab"", the speaker is implying that the other person is intentionally using confusing language to overwhelm or mislead others.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears to be a simple question, the true intention is to criticize and mock. the use of the term ""bafflegab"" and the implication that the person is trying to ""smother everyone"" with it adds a layer of sarcasm to the statement. the question is rhetorical, not genuinely seeking an answer, but rather pointing out perceived dishonest behavior.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

Steps:

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.

- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of surprise, amazement, and realization, as indicated by the capitalized ""gee"" and the words ""gasp,"" ""amazement,"" and ""realization"" enclosed in asterisks. these elements suggest a dramatic reaction to something.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or ridiculing someone else's statement or opinion. the exaggerated reactions (""gee,"" ""gasp,"" ""amazement,"" ""realization"") are likely not genuine but rather used to convey sarcasm. the phrase ""neither are yours"" at the beginning suggests this is a retort to someone else's comment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the dramatic surface sentiment contrasts sharply with the likely dismissive or mocking true intention. the use of exaggerated expressions of surprise and realization, combined with the context of a disagreement (as implied by ""neither are yours""), strongly indicates sarcasm. the asterisks around the expressions further emphasize the artificial nature of these reactions, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be serious and philosophical, discussing complex issues of personhood, rights, and human value. the tone seems earnest, with phrases like ""i deny"", ""i disagree"", and ""i am not sure"" indicating a thoughtful engagement with the topic.

step 2: true intention
however, the true intention becomes clearer towards the end. the author introduces an extreme and morally repugnant idea (restricting rights to ""only white folks"") as if it were a logical extension of the previous arguments. this is likely meant to expose the flaws in the original argument by taking it to an absurd conclusion.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the majority of the text maintains a serious tone, the final sentence reveals a sarcastic intent. the author is not actually advocating for racial discrimination, but using this extreme example to highlight the perceived inconsistency or danger in the original argument about human rights and personhood. the rhetorical question at the end (""...right?"") further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ","to accurately classify this short phrase, i'll think through it step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to mildly positive. ""oh"" can indicate surprise or acknowledgment, while ""ok then"" suggests acceptance or agreement. there are no overtly negative words or emojis.

step 2: true intention
without more context, it's difficult to determine the true intention definitively. however, this phrase is often used in a dismissive or resigned manner, especially when someone is unconvinced but doesn't want to argue further. the brevity and the combination of ""oh"" with ""ok then"" can imply a lack of enthusiasm or genuine agreement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a potential mismatch between the surface agreement and the possible underlying dismissiveness or resignation. however, this mismatch isn't strong enough to confidently label it as sarcastic without more context. the phrase is ambiguous and could be genuinely accepting or mildly sarcastic depending on the tone and situation in which it's used.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear sarcastic indicators, i would err on the side of caution.

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be critical of unrestricted firearm purchases, with phrases like ""not a good option."" the text also includes an apology for possible failed sarcasm, which complicates the initial interpretation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to criticize the idea of unrestricted gun purchases. the rhetorical question at the beginning (""as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training?"") suggests disagreement with such a policy. the apology for ""failed sarcasm"" indicates that the author was attempting to use sarcasm earlier in the conversation.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while there are elements of sarcasm in the broader context (as evidenced by the apology for ""failed sarcasm""), this particular statement doesn't appear to be sarcastic itself. the author is directly stating their opinion that unrestricted gun purchases are ""not a good option"" and apologizing for any previous unclear sarcasm.

given this analysis, i believe the correct label is:

the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. the use of ""gasp!"" and capitalized words like ""wide"" and ""vast"" suggest exaggeration or mock surprise. phrases like ""closed minded right wing bigots"" have a clearly negative connotation.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be defending an open-minded church and criticizing those who oppose it. the author is using sarcasm and exaggeration to mock people who are shocked by a church that doesn't align with traditional, conservative interpretations of the bible.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the surface negativity and the underlying supportive message. the author uses sarcasm throughout, starting with ""oh no"" and ""gasp!"" to mock those who would be alarmed by an inclusive church. the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions further emphasize the sarcastic tone.

based on this analysis, i can confidently say:

"So, evolution is falsified because Ford didn't draft chimps to work the assembly lines?   I've never seen such nonsense paraded about with such pride. I'd congratulate you on your win DamEtel, but I'm more impressed with your patience.",1,"
### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears dismissive and critical. key phrases like ""evolution is falsified"" and ""such nonsense paraded about with such pride"" indicate a strong negative reaction. the mention of congratulating someone seems positive, but is immediately undercut.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock and ridicule an argument against evolution. the rhetorical question about ford and chimps is clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but to highlight the absurdity of the argument being criticized. the praise for ""dametel"" at the end is not genuine congratulations, but rather admiration for their patience in dealing with what the author sees as ridiculous arguments.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying intention to mock, but the sarcasm adds a layer of biting ridicule. the use of hyperbole (comparing evolution to ford's assembly lines), rhetorical questions, and false praise all contribute to a heavily sarcastic tone that undermines the argument it appears to present.

- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation

the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

the surface sentiment appears confrontational and defensive. phrases like ""yeah ok buddy"" and ""just because you can not figure out"" indicate irritation. the tone is dismissive and challenging, especially with the final latin phrase (which translates to a crude insult).

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to sarcastically rebuke the person being addressed. the writer is using exaggerated language and rhetorical devices to mock the other person's intelligence and ability to understand. the use of capitalization in ""r*e*a*d"" and the quotation marks around ""tim"" suggest derision. the latin phrase at the end is a final sarcastic flourish, using an archaic insult to further belittle the addressee.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is confrontational, the true intention goes beyond mere confrontation into sarcasm. the exaggerated language, the mock-polite ""buddy,"" the implication that the other person lacks ""mental fortitude,"" and the dramatic use of a latin insult all contribute to a highly sarcastic tone. the writer is not sincerely asking if ""tim"" has anything to add, but rather sarcastically implying that ""tim"" has nothing of value to contribute.

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""they want you to stop posting"", ""they don't want their rants challenged"", and ""it's typical of the whole evolutionary community"" indicate frustration and disapproval. the tone seems accusatory towards a specific group.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a genuine criticism of the ""evolutionary community"". the author appears to be sincerely expressing their opinion that this community is intolerant of opposing views and prefers to ""rant"" unchallenged. the reference to another conversation (""obvious_child and i are exploring this"") reinforces the impression that this is a sincere belief.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn't a significant discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the language is direct and critical, but it doesn't employ typical sarcastic devices like exaggeration, irony, or mock praise. the author seems to be straightforwardly expressing their negative opinion about a group's behavior.

given this analysis, i can conclude with confidence:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and skeptical. the text uses rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios to challenge the concept of logical laws existing only in the mind. there's a mix of philosophical and logical terminology with colloquial language. no overtly sarcastic markers like exaggeration or emojis are present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to seriously argue against the idea that laws of logic exist only in the mind. the author is using a reductio ad absurdum approach, demonstrating what they see as the absurd consequences of such a view (e.g., being able to choose not to believe in logical laws and thereby making them cease to exist).

step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there doesn't appear to be a significant disconnect. the questioning tone and use of hypotheticals align with the genuine attempt to argue against a philosophical position. the introduction of the made-up term ""hofflenosh"" is used to illustrate a point rather than for sarcastic effect. the overall structure and content of the argument suggest a sincere, albeit somewhat informal, philosophical discussion rather than a sarcastic comment.

Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a simple question asking about someone's understanding of science and the scientific method. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords, emojis, or sentimental phrases.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the phrasing:
- ""i take it"" suggests a presumption rather than a genuine inquiry.
- ""you have no understanding"" is a strongly negative assertion disguised as a question.
- ""much less"" further emphasizes the perceived lack of knowledge.
- the use of a rhetorical question format implies the speaker is not actually seeking an answer, but making a statement.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be a straightforward question, the true intention is to criticize or belittle the other person's knowledge. the contrast between the seemingly innocent question format and the underlying criticism, combined with the rhetorical nature of the question, strongly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a careful analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and somewhat confrontational. the use of quotation marks around ""respector"" and ""more"" suggests skepticism. the phrasing as a question indicates uncertainty or challenge to an idea.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to point out a perceived inconsistency or hypocrisy in the idea that god values a mother's life more than an unborn child's. the use of ""iow"" (in other words) and the rephrasing of the question emphasizes this point. the asterisks around *god* could be interpreted as adding emphasis or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is questioning, the true intention appears to be more critical and sarcastic. the author is likely not genuinely asking for clarification, but rather using a rhetorical question to highlight what they see as a logical flaw in the opposing viewpoint. the use of quotation marks and unusual punctuation (like hyphens and asterisks) adds to the sarcastic tone.

the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

        ","i will think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1 (surface sentiment): 
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. the phrase ""not much of anything else either"" suggests a lack or deficiency, but there are no strongly emotional words or clear indicators of sentiment.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention seems to be expressing disappointment or criticism. the phrase ""it would seem"" adds a tone of skepticism or mild derision. the sentence implies that not only is there a lack of the primary thing being discussed (which is not specified in this isolated sentence), but there's also a lack of other expected or desirable qualities.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
while the surface sentiment is relatively mild, the underlying intention carries more weight. the casual phrasing ""not much of anything else either"" combined with the skeptical ""it would seem"" suggests a sarcastic tone. the speaker is likely using understatement to emphasize their criticism or disappointment.

based on this analysis, i believe this statement is likely sarcastic, though without more context, it's difficult to be entirely certain.

Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

Steps:

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems matter-of-fact in the first sentence, stating ""apes are sentient"" as if it's an established fact. the second part suggests some uncertainty with ""guess your theory is out the window."" the final sentence presents two options in a seemingly neutral tone.

step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be challenging or mocking someone else's theory or belief. the statement about apes being sentient is used to set up a contradiction with the addressee's theory. the second sentence, ""either that or apes need to be freed from the zoo,"" presents an absurd logical conclusion to further undermine the opposing viewpoint.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the seemingly straightforward surface sentiment and the underlying mocking intention. the use of ""guess your theory is out the window"" is a sarcastic way of pointing out a perceived flaw in someone's argument. the false dilemma presented at the end (either the theory is wrong or apes should be freed) is an exaggeration used to highlight the perceived ridiculousness of the opposing view.

given this analysis, the statement is clearly using irony to make a point, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

the true intention is to mock or ridicule. this becomes clear when we consider:
1. the statement is likely referencing sarah palin's infamous quote about seeing russia from alaska, but replacing it with ""finland"" and ""basement.""

        ","i will think through this step-by-step to ensure an accurate classification:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and somewhat exasperated. the exclamation marks and multiple question marks indicate strong emotion. the phrase ""i see you americans deal as loosely with..."" suggests disapproval. the ""surely it is..."" implies correction of a perceived mistake.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to mock and criticize americans' perceived poor language skills. the author is pointing out errors in french and spanish phrases, implying that americans are careless with foreign languages as well as their own. the exaggerated punctuation (""?????"") further emphasizes the author's disbelief and ridicule.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface criticism in step 1 aligns with the mocking intention in step 2, but the use of exaggeration and rhetorical questioning elevates this from simple criticism to sarcasm. the author is not genuinely seeking clarification but rather using the question format to emphasize the perceived absurdity of the mistake.

given this analysis, i can confidently classify this as:

label: sarcastic",1

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and accusatory. the use of ""your god"" and ""hypocrisy"" suggests a critical tone towards religious beliefs.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to challenge and criticize religious arguments against abortion by pointing out a perceived contradiction. the question about unborn babies drowning in genesis is not a genuine inquiry, but a rhetorical device to highlight what the speaker sees as hypocrisy in pro-life religious arguments.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface question ""so, how many unborn babies did your god drown in genesis?"" is not seeking an actual number, but is using irony to make a point. the follow-up statement ""talk about hypocrisy"" further emphasizes the sarcastic intent. the speaker is using this rhetorical question and accusation of hypocrisy to sarcastically criticize religious arguments against abortion.

### Example:
Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure a thorough assessment:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""rendering the citizens into prey"" and ""self defense is not allowed"" indicate strong disapproval of california's laws. the use of ""kalifornia"" instead of california suggests mockery.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize california's laws, particularly those related to self-defense and citizen rights. the exaggeration in ""most of the laws"" and ""you can't point to many that don't"" suggests hyperbole. the phrase ""peoples republic of kalifornia"" is a derogatory nickname, implying california is overly regulated like a communist state.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment aligns closely with the true intention - both are critical of california's laws. while there is clear exaggeration and mockery, these elements serve to emphasize the author's genuine criticism rather than to convey an opposite meaning. the sarcasm is present in the nickname and hyperbole, but it's used to reinforce the literal message rather than contradict it.

label: not sarcastic

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a series of earnest questions. the text outlines the requirements for carrying a gun legally and then asks if such individuals would use that privilege to commit murder over trivial matters. it then questions whether illegal means would be easier and more likely for disturbed students. the tone seems inquisitive and logical on the surface.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical nature of the questions and the exaggerated scenario presented. the author is not genuinely asking these questions but rather using them to highlight the absurdity of the notion that legal gun carriers would commit such crimes. the detailed list of requirements serves to emphasize how unlikely it is that someone going through this process would then use their gun for trivial reasons.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface-level inquisitive tone and the underlying intention to ridicule the idea that legal gun carriers pose a significant threat. the use of rhetorical questions, especially the second paragraph starting with ""wouldn't it just be easier,"" strongly indicates sarcasm. the author is using irony to make their point about the improbability of legal gun carriers committing such crimes, compared to the more likely scenario of illegal gun use.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be to emphasize the high quality of all items in the top ten, rather than just the top three. the rhetorical question ""how the hell can you narrow it down to three?"" is not actually seeking an answer, but rather expressing the difficulty or impossibility of such a task. the second sentence reinforces this by pointing out the fierce competition in the entire top ten.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment shows surprise or disbelief, the true intention aligns with this sentiment. there doesn't appear to be a significant discrepancy between the surface meaning and the true intention. the language is emphatic and somewhat hyperbolic, but it doesn't seem to be using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant.

Input: ""oh! and i just finished breakfast...   can anyone say, ""fly by!""""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically
- the overall message conveys irritation at having to rush right after finishing breakfast

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: [the provided example input]

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the text appears to be informative and educational, providing detailed scientific information about the relationship between wolves and dogs. the tone seems neutral and factual, citing sources and presenting genetic evidence.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the opening sentence reveals a different intention: ""i'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species."" this suggests the author is actually criticizing the opposing side's lack of knowledge or willingness to admit facts.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the seemingly neutral, fact-based content and the opening critical remark indicates sarcasm. the author is using an abundance of scientific information to highlight the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the opposing side in the debate.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Please stop demonstrating your complete inability to understand evolutionary theory. How is Texas Stadium meaningful in the population of the earth? Do various blimp pilots who soar over Texas Stadium have better sexual success than you? You seem to be a bit of a sad sack.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. key phrases like ""complete inability to understand"", ""sad sack"", and the rhetorical questions convey a tone of frustration and mockery towards the person being addressed.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing the addressee's misunderstanding or misapplication of evolutionary theory. the author uses:
- sarcastic requests: ""please stop demonstrating...""
- absurd examples: referencing texas stadium and blimp pilots in relation to evolutionary success
- rhetorical questions: to highlight the absurdity of the addressee's apparent argument
- direct insult: calling the addressee a ""sad sack""

the author is using these devices to ridicule what they perceive as a fundamentally flawed understanding of evolution.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is clearly negative, the true intention goes beyond mere criticism. the use of absurd examples and sarcastic tone elevates this from straightforward criticism to sarcasm. the author is not simply stating that the addressee is wrong, but is using exaggeration and mockery to highlight the perceived ridiculousness of their position.

given this analysis, i can confidently label this as:

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:
sarcastic

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""millions of athiests trying to make up for lost time""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step as the meaning isn't immediately obvious:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. the phrase ""i had to go talk to ralph"" sounds like a normal, friendly interaction. there are no overtly negative words or phrases.

step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, ""talk to ralph on the big white telephone"" is likely a euphemism for vomiting into a toilet. the ""big white telephone"" is probably referring to a toilet bowl, and ""talking to ralph"" is a colloquial way of saying ""vomiting"" (as in the sound ""ralph"" one might make when vomiting).

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the seemingly innocuous surface sentiment and the actual meaning. the speaker is using a humorous euphemism to describe an unpleasant bodily function. this kind of playful misdirection is often used in sarcastic or ironic statements.

given this analysis, i can conclude:

### label: sarcastic

the use of the euphemism to describe vomiting in a way that initially sounds like a normal conversation is a form of verbal irony, which is a key component of sarcasm.",1

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears angry and dismissive. key phrases like ""oh please dont give me that xxxx"" and ""its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement"" indicate frustration and sarcasm. the tone is confrontational and defensive.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the idea of gay marriage. the author uses rhetorical questions (""why implement it now??"") and sarcastic statements (""its so great that you can..."") to express their opposition. they imply that allowing gay marriage is a sign of moral decline (""steeps so low"").

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the initial sarcastic praise (""its so great that you can..."") is actually a criticism. the rhetorical questions are not genuine inquiries but ways to express disapproval. the overall tone is deeply sarcastic, using irony to mock and criticize the opposing viewpoint.

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

- the phrase ""go figure"" at the end, which often expresses exasperation
- the use of ""apparently"" suggests disbelief or skepticism
- the contrast between ""can't say no"" and ""decide to just say 'no'"" implies a contradiction

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the comment is likely referring to a situation where business owners are being forced to provide services for gay weddings against their will
- the author is pointing out what they see as an illogical situation where owners can't refuse service but can go out of business entirely
- the tone is critical of this perceived lack of choice for business owners

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface frustration aligns with the deeper criticism of the situation
- the use of ""apparently"" and ""go figure"" are sarcastic devices to emphasize the perceived absurdity
- the juxtaposition of not being able to say no to one thing but being able to say no to everything (by going out of business) is used to highlight the perceived irony

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative. there are no overtly positive or negative words. the phrase ""make up for lost time"" could imply a sense of urgency or regret.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or criticizing atheists. the statement implies that atheists are suddenly rushing to do something, as if they've realized they were wrong. this plays on the stereotype that atheists might regret their lack of faith.

step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear disconnect between the surface neutrality and the underlying mockery. the statement uses irony by suggesting atheists are frantically trying to compensate for something, likely implying a sudden turn to faith or spiritual activities.

### Example:
Input: ""so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.""

Steps:
step 1 (surface sentiment):
the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive. key phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief. the tone seems confrontational and assertive, especially in the last sentence.

step 2 (true intention):
the true intention is to mock the idea that personal fidelity is required to oppose gay marriage. the author uses a rhetorical question and sarcasm to highlight the perceived hypocrisy or irrelevance of this argument. they then cynically suggest that politicians simply follow public opinion for electoral gain, regardless of personal beliefs or behavior.

step 3 (comparison and analysis):
the surface criticism aligns with the underlying sarcastic intent, but the sarcasm adds a layer of mockery that goes beyond simple disagreement. the rhetorical question, casual language (""gimme a break""), and the matter-of-fact explanation of political motivations all contribute to a sarcastic tone that undermines the arguments it appears to present.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, and i found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   ""the discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. in nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""   it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. and the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. the only one getting anything wrong here is you.""

Steps:
step 1: the surface sentiment appears informative and somewhat confrontational. the comment starts with ""oh, and i found this,"" suggesting additional information. it then presents a scientific quote and concludes with statements that seem to correct someone's misconception.

step 2: upon closer examination, the true intention becomes clearer:
- the ""oh, and i found this"" opener has a casual, almost dismissive tone.
- the scientific quote is used to build credibility for the argument.
- the phrase ""it appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite.
- the final sentence, ""the only one getting anything wrong here is you,"" is a direct, sarcastic attack on the person being addressed.

step 3: comparing steps 1 and 2, we can infer that while the surface appears informative, the true intention is to sarcastically refute someone's argument. the casual opening, the use of scientific evidence to contradict the other person, and the final direct attack all contribute to a sarcastic tone.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""yeah they were. mostly killed by criminals with guns. now prove that any legislation that obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   i'm not holding my breath and i'm not expecting a rational response either...""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- appears to agree initially: ""yeah they were.""
- seems to challenge obama's potential legislation
- expresses skepticism: ""i'm not holding my breath""
- appears dismissive: ""not expecting a rational response""

step 2: true intention
- the initial agreement is likely insincere
- the challenge to ""prove"" legislation effectiveness is likely rhetorical
- ""i'm not holding my breath"" implies strong disbelief
- ""not expecting a rational response"" suggests the commenter views opposing arguments as irrational

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface agreement contrasts with the overall skeptical and dismissive tone
- the rhetorical challenge and expressions of disbelief indicate the commenter is not earnestly seeking proof
- the final statement about expecting no rational response further reinforces the sarcastic intent

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","i'll analyze this step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears critical and confrontational. phrases like ""wet dreams of those slavering,"" ""appalling british figures,"" and ""suck on that"" indicate a strong, negative tone. the text seems to be arguing against a point about crime rates in britain vs. the usa.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to sarcastically refute an argument about crime rates. the author uses exaggerated language (""wet dreams,"" ""slavering"") to mock those who might celebrate british crime statistics. the phrase ""that dangerous place britain"" is clearly ironic, as the author's point is that britain is actually much safer than the usa. the final ""suck on that"" is a provocative challenge to those who might disagree.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment is overtly critical and confrontational, the true intention employs sarcasm to make its point. the exaggerated language, use of irony (""that dangerous place britain""), and the provocative conclusion all contribute to a sarcastic tone. the author is using this sarcasm to emphasize their point about the relative safety of britain compared to the usa.

### Example:
Input: ""not in matters of atheism. tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of darwin, are the writings of darwin disregarded? or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, asking questions about how scientific discoveries related to darwin's writings are treated. there are no overtly positive or negative keywords or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer when we examine the rhetorical questions and word choice. the phrase ""trumpeted to the masses"" suggests exaggeration and implies that darwin's writings are overly celebrated. the contrast between ""disregarded"" and ""trumpeted"" sets up a stark, unrealistic dichotomy.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface appears to be genuine questions, the true intention is to criticize how darwin's work is treated in relation to new scientific discoveries. the sarcasm lies in the implied answer to the rhetorical questions - that darwin's writings are indeed ""trumpeted to the masses"" rather than critically examined.

### Example:
Input: ""ah, i see. your reasons are secret reasons. on a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! nice debate. who's really playing the game here?""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be agreeable and understanding, with phrases like ""ah, i see"" and ""nice debate."" however, this is quickly undermined by the following analysis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention is to criticize and mock the opponent's lack of substantive arguments. this is evident through:
- rhetorical devices: using irony in ""your reasons are secret reasons"" and ""nice debate""
- language style: short, punchy sentences and ellipsis (...) to emphasize the opponent's failure to provide reasons
- rhetorical question: ""who's really playing the game here?"" implies the opponent is being disingenuous

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface agreeableness in step 1 sharply contrasts with the critical true intention in step 2. this mismatch, combined with the use of irony and mockery, clearly indicates sarcasm.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""oh, well, that convinces me.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive or agreeable. the phrase ""oh, well"" suggests acceptance, and ""that convinces me"" indicates being persuaded.

step 2: true intention
the brevity and simplicity of the statement, combined with the casual ""oh, well"" opener, suggest insincerity. the speaker likely means the opposite - they are not convinced at all.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the superficially positive surface sentiment and the likely negative true intention strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is using verbal irony to express skepticism or disagreement.

Label:

### Example:
Input: ""and ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears matter-of-fact and straightforward. it states a biological reality about pregnancy affecting a woman's body without overtly positive or negative language.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be highlighting the disproportionate burden placed on women in pregnancy, likely in the context of abortion debates. the use of ""endure"" suggests hardship and implies criticism of those who may overlook this aspect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by:
- the exclamation ""oh!""
- use of ellipsis to build anticipation
- the rhetorical question ""can anyone say...""

step 2: true intention
analyzing deeper:
- the phrase ""i just finished breakfast"" implies it's early in the day
- ""fly by"" suggests something happening very quickly
- the contrast between a leisurely activity (breakfast) and sudden rush implies frustration

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the excited surface tone contradicts the likely frustration
- the rhetorical question emphasizes the contrast sarcastically

        ","i'll think through this step-by-step to ensure a thorough analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a straightforward suggestion or instruction. it uses neutral language to propose an experiment regarding sexual attraction, followed by a request for reporting findings. there are no overtly sentimental words or emojis.

step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be mocking or ridiculing the idea that sexual orientation is a choice or can be changed through experimentation. the phrase ""you need to experiment"" implies an absurdity to the suggestion. the casual ""after you're done, come back and report your findings!"" further emphasizes the ridiculous nature of the proposed experiment.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface sentiment appears to be a neutral suggestion, the underlying intention is to satirize the notion that one can change or choose their sexual orientation. the contrast between the seemingly serious instruction and the absurdity of what's being suggested indicates sarcasm. the statement is using irony to criticize a viewpoint that sexual orientation is a matter of choice or experimentation.

while the surface statement is factual, the underlying tone and word choice (""endure"") reveal a critical perspective. however, this doesn't align clearly with typical sarcastic structures or exaggeration.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Well, I think it is best to use a real source. Like the Australian FBI, called the A.I.C..   The latest figures. Violent crimes from 1996 to 2007 (per 100,000 persons per year)   Homicide is pretty much a flat line no? However there violent crime is not. And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.   So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let me think through this step-by-step:

step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears informative and analytical. the author cites statistics and sources, and uses phrases like ""to be fair"" which suggest an attempt at objectivity. there's no overtly sarcastic language or emojis present.

step 2: true intention
looking deeper, there are some clues that suggest a critical stance:
- the phrase ""like the australian fbi, called the a.i.c."" could be seen as slightly mocking.
- the rhetorical question at the end (""then what is the point of mentioning that gun related crime went down?"") implies criticism of gun control arguments.
- the overall structure builds to this final question, suggesting the author is challenging a common pro-gun control argument.

step 3: comparison and analysis
while the surface tone is informative, the underlying structure and final rhetorical question reveal a critical stance towards gun control arguments. however, this criticism is presented through factual information and a logical argument rather than clear sarcasm or exaggeration.

given this analysis, i don't believe this text meets the threshold for sarcasm. the author is being critical and rhetorical, but not sarcastic in the traditional sense.
