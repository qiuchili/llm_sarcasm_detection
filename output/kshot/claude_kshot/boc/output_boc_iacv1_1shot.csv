        Well try Arkansas (75/25), Georgia (76/24), Kentucky (75/25), Michigan (59/41), Mississippi (86/14), Montana (67/33), North Dakota (73/27), Ohio (62/38), Oklahoma (76/24), Oregon (57/43), and Utah (66/34).   All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the ""religious right"" feel the same way.

emotional words: none explicitly present
punctuation: exclamation mark (!)
surface emotion: surprise or disbelief

special symbols: none

### brief response:
the sentence is short but conveys a sense of surprise or disbelief about the addressee's support for seti. the exclamation mark adds emphasis and could indicate sarcasm, especially if the speaker disagrees with seti's value.

### label: sarcastic

the combination of the exclamation mark, the implied contrast between the addressee's views and the speaker's expectations, and the emphasis on ""seti"" suggests this is likely a sarcastic comment questioning the logic or consistency of supporting seti.",1,"here's my analysis of the provided input:

### brief response:

cues:
1. topic: seti (search for extraterrestrial intelligence)
2. cultural background: scientific/space exploration context
3. rhetorical devices: exclamation, implied contrast
4. context: appears to be a response to someone's opinion about seti
5. emotional contrasts: surprise or disbelief implied

the exclamation and implied contrast between the speaker's expectation and the addressee's apparent belief in seti suggest a sarcastic tone.

- punctuation: use of periods, no excessive punctuation 
- topic: gun laws, crime statistics, and credibility of studies

the text presents statistics about increased gun ownership correlating with decreased crime, then questions studies that likely show the opposite. the skeptical tone and framing of the information suggests this is a sarcastic commentary on conflicting gun statistics and studies.

"No. You're missing the point. Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.   Al Gore is a shyster...just like Michael Moore. Documentary, my XXX!   Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before. Think it could be resulting from their industrial age?   ...and he's pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do. Check the stats on his personal home. Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.   He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly, yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California.   We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills). This fact does not diminish the lies told by Al Gore...the ones that got him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, both of which become more meaningless each year.

The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming. The Government's expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.   2.	The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was “not possible?to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.	The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.   5.	The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.   11.	The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand. The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.

Hold the mythology, please.   from infidels.org -   The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ""the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference."" Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.   It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.   Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal.

        Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the input text, here are the relevant cues i've extracted:

emotional contrasts:
- seemingly casual tone contrasted with serious subject matter (death penalty)

special symbols:
- none present

emotional words:
- ""ears bleed"" (hyperbole expressing frustration)

common knowledge:
- death penalty cases often involve lengthy appeals processes

punctuation:
- lack of proper punctuation and spelling (""apeals"" instead of ""appeals"")

given these cues, particularly the use of hyperbole and the casual tone when discussing a serious topic, i would classify this as:

### label: sarcastic

the statement appears to be making a sarcastic comment about the lengthy appeals process in death penalty cases.",1,"### brief response:

cues:
1. cultural background: refers to the death penalty and appeals process, suggesting a context of the criminal justice system.
2. emotional contrasts: serious topic (death penalty) contrasted with exaggerated consequence (""ears bleed"").
3. topic: criminal justice system, specifically the death penalty and appeals process.
4. keywords: ""death penalty,"" ""appeals,"" ""ears bleed""
5. special symbols: none present.

the exaggeration and contrast between the serious topic and the hyperbolic outcome suggest sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1,"based on the input text, here are the extracted cues:

cultural background:
- references the death penalty and appeals process in the criminal justice system

topic:
- criminal sentencing and appeals

context:
- appears to be discussing the aftermath of a criminal conviction

punctuation:
- informal, missing apostrophe in ""it's""
- exaggeration with ""till your ears bleed""

keywords:
- ""death penalty""
- ""appeals""
- ""ears bleed""

the exaggerated language and casual tone suggest this is likely a sarcastic comment about the lengthy appeals process for death penalty cases.

the statement is brief and lacks clear sarcastic indicators. it appears to be a straightforward clarification or counterpoint to a previous assertion.

### label: not sarcastic",0,"based on the limited input provided, i'll analyze the available cues:

common knowledge: the statement seems to reference some prior context that is not provided.

cultural background: not enough information to determine.

context: insufficient context is provided to fully understand what this statement is referring to.

emotional words: none present.

surface emotion: the tone appears matter-of-fact rather than emotional.

given the lack of clear sarcastic indicators and the straightforward nature of the statement, i would classify this as:

### label: not sarcastic

however, it's important to note that this classification is made with very limited information. a fuller context could potentially alter this assessment.",0,"### brief response:

the phrase ""as is obvious"" followed by a statement countering a generalization suggests a sarcastic tone. the speaker is likely using understatement to point out that something presented as obvious or universal is actually not the case for everyone.",1,0

        ### Input:
        Male

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","for this input, there isn't enough context or information to accurately classify it as sarcastic or not sarcastic. the single word ""male"" doesn't provide sufficient cues to determine sarcasm. let's break it down:

### brief response:

cues:
1. keywords: ""male""
2. rhetorical devices: none present
3. cultural background: no specific cultural references
4. surface emotion: none detected
5. punctuation: none present

given the lack of context and the brevity of the input, it's not possible to confidently determine if this is meant to be sarcastic or not.

### label: cannot be determined

the input is too brief and lacks context to make a reliable sarcasm classification.",0,"i apologize, but i don't have enough context or information to properly classify ""male"" as sarcastic or not sarcastic. a single word like this lacks the necessary cues and context to determine sarcasm. to make a proper classification, i would need a full sentence or statement that provides more context and details. without additional information, i cannot reliably extract cues or make a determination about sarcasm in this case.",0,"i apologize, but i don't have enough context or information to properly classify this single-word input ""male"" for sarcasm or extract meaningful cues. sarcasm typically requires more context and a fuller statement or expression to be identified. with just one word, there's not enough content to make a determination about sarcasm or extract the requested cues.

"Sure.   The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does.

        ","here's my analysis of the input text:

### brief response:

cues extracted:
1. emotional words: none significant
2. keywords: newly-evolved, structure
3. punctuation: period at the end of each sentence
4. surface emotion: casual, matter-of-fact
5. language style: short, simple sentences. casual tone.

the text appears to be downplaying or trivializing something (likely the emergence of a complex structure) by saying ""it happens"" as if it's a common, unremarkable occurrence. this casual treatment of something that would typically be considered significant suggests sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1,"based on the input text, here are the extracted cues:

topic: evolution or biological structures
punctuation: simple period usage, no exaggerated punctuation
language style: casual, brief, matter-of-fact tone
cultural background: scientific/biological context
surface emotion: nonchalant, dismissive

### brief response:
the text appears to be downplaying or dismissing the significance of evolutionary processes in a casual manner, which is likely intended to be sarcastic given the complexity and rarity of evolutionary changes.

### label: sarcastic",1,"based on the given input, here are the extracted cues:

context: the statement appears to be referring to some kind of structure, possibly in a biological or evolutionary context.

emotional words: none present.

cultural background: no specific cultural references.

surface emotion: the tone seems casual and dismissive.

Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure.

        Actually just as many atheist help the needy.   Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the analysis of the input text, i would classify this as:

### label: sarcastic

here's my reasoning based on the cues:

1. punctuation: multiple uses of exclamation marks and question marks, suggesting emphasis and emotional tone.

2. cultural background: references to atheism, religion, and well-known philanthropists, indicating a context of debate about religious vs. non-religious charitable giving.

3. surface emotion: the tone appears frustrated and defensive, with an undercurrent of mockery towards the opposing viewpoint.

4. emotional words: ""kill your argument,"" ""ignorant,"" ""closed-minded,"" suggesting strong feelings.

5. context: the text is clearly a rebuttal to someone (grizzly6626) who claimed religious people are more charitable. the writer uses sarcasm throughout to counter this argument.

specific sarcastic elements include:
- ""of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it.""
- ""oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?""
- ""didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626""
- the use of ""*",1,"based on the input text, here is my analysis and classification:

label: sarcastic

cues:
1. language style: informal, conversational tone with sarcastic undertones throughout
2. punctuation: frequent use of quotation marks for emphasis, exclamation points for dramatic effect
3. emotional contrasts: contrasting religious charity claims with examples of atheist philanthropy
4. context: responding to an apparent claim that only religious people help the needy
5. surface emotion: frustration and mockery towards the original argument

the text uses sarcasm extensively to criticize and disprove an argument about religious charity. phrases like ""oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?"" and ""didn't mean to wake you up"" are clearly sarcastic. the overall tone is confrontational and mocking, using examples and counter-arguments delivered with heavy sarcasm to refute the original claim.",1,"based on the analysis of the input text, here are the extracted cues:

1. common knowledge: references to well-known philanthropists and their charitable activities.

2. rhetorical devices: use of rhetorical questions, examples, and statistics to support arguments.

4. cultural background: discussion of american philanthropy, religious institutions, and atheism.

5. emotional words: ""open-minded,"" ""kill your argument,"" ""ignorant,"" ""closed-minded""

given these cues, the label for this text is:

cues extracted:

### label: sarcastic

the text uses a dismissive and accusatory tone, along with strong emotional language, to mock the opposing viewpoint on creationism. the sarcasm is evident in the exaggerated claim that the other person ""lives on delusions"" and the absolute statement that creationism has no merits and is a fraud. this overly harsh and mocking tone is characteristic of sarcastic rhetoric in debates on controversial topics.",1,"### brief response:

        Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend.

And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me.

So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards.

That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards.

        ### Input:
        So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"".

        Just because you don't have a handle on what civil rights are doesn't make the phrase arbitrary. It's a legal term, not a catch phrase. I'm not a lawyer, I couldn't track down the exact definition they use in Massachusetts, but rest assured they have one.

### Example:
Input: the founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote. they didn't want mob rule and chaos. ""most of the founders believed that property ownership was essential to good citizenship and therefore that only property owners should be able to vote. 'property', in those days, also included slaves, of course, and half of the founders were slave owners....the maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote. in 1787, there were about four million people living in the 13 original states. but only about four percent of them, it is estimated, could vote. excluded were the one million slaves, the two million women, anyone under the age of 21, and all non-property owners.""

        ### Input:
        Be wary of names. 'junk' DNA is not rubbish ... it's called 'junk' because we don't know entirely what it is used for... But just look at all the blank spaces on this post. They are nothing, but they are keeping the words in order.   Evolutionaries are putting too much faith in names of words - such as human embryonic 'gill slits'   or   'transitional' fossil

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the analysis of the input text, here are the extracted cues:

1. rhetorical devices: analogy (comparing ""junk"" dna to blank spaces in text)
2. emotional words: ""wary"", ""rubbish""
3. emotional contrasts: none significant
4. special symbols: quotation marks for emphasis, ellipsis (...), capitalization for emphasis
5. cultural background: scientific context, debate about evolution and biology

the text uses a seemingly straightforward tone to make a point about scientific naming conventions and their potential to be misleading. while there's a critique of evolutionary thinking, it's presented in a matter-of-fact manner rather than with obvious sarcasm.

label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be making a sincere argument about the nature of ""junk"" dna and criticizing certain evolutionary interpretations. while it uses some rhetorical devices, the overall tone doesn't suggest sarcasm but rather a genuine attempt to present an alternative perspective on scientific terminology and interpretation.",0,"### brief response:

cues extracted:
1. context: discussion about scientific terminology and evolutionary biology
2. topic: dna classification, embryology, fossils
3. special symbols: use of quotation marks for emphasis ('junk', 'gill slits', 'transitional')
4. common knowledge: general understanding of dna, evolution, and fossils
5. rhetorical devices: analogy (comparing 'junk' dna to blank spaces in text), cautionary tone

### label: not sarcastic

the text appears to be a genuine cautionary statement about misinterpreting scientific terminology, rather than a sarcastic comment. the author is seriously arguing that labels like 'junk' dna can be misleading and that evolutionists may be overly reliant on certain terms. the use of an analogy and the overall explanatory tone suggest a sincere attempt to convey a point rather than sarcasm.",0,"based on the analysis of the input text, here are the extracted cues:

1. emotional contrasts: the text contrasts the idea of ""junk"" with its potential importance, suggesting a more nuanced view.

2. language style: use of analogies (blank spaces in a post) and quotation marks around contentious terms (""junk"", ""gill slits"", ""transitional"") indicate a critical perspective.

3. surface emotion: the tone is cautionary and slightly skeptical, as evidenced by phrases like ""be wary"" and ""putting too much faith"".

4. common knowledge: references to scientific concepts like dna, embryonic development, and fossils, which are often debated in evolutionary discussions.

5. keywords: ""junk dna"", ""gill slits"", ""transitional fossil"", ""evolutionaries""

the text uses a mix of caution, analogy, and criticism to challenge certain scientific labels and interpretations. while it employs some rhetorical devices, it doesn't appear to be using exaggeration or irony for humorous effect.

the use of the term ""pork"" in a political context, along with the dismissive tone, suggests this is a sarcastic comment about unnecessary or self-serving additions to legislation.",1,"based on the input text, here are the extracted cues:

1. context: the text appears to be commenting on legislation, specifically referencing additional provisions added to a bill.

2. language style: casual and colloquial, using the phrase ""pork tacked onto"" which is political jargon.

3. common knowledge: in politics, ""pork"" refers to unnecessary or wasteful spending added to bills, often to gain support from specific lawmakers.

4. emotional contrasts: there's a subtle contrast between the straightforward ""no"" and the more colorful description that follows.

5. cultural background: this comment reflects understanding of the u.s. legislative process and common criticisms of it.

Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.

        ### Input:
        You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality.

the text appears to be a political statement expressing concern or criticism about potential future outcomes if a certain political ideology (the left) gains more influence. while it doesn't contain explicit sarcasm markers, the metaphorical use of ""taste"" and the ominous implication could be interpreted as having a sarcastic undertone.

### label: sarcastic

the statement uses a subtle form of sarcasm to criticize left-leaning policies or ideologies, implying negative consequences without explicitly stating them. the sarcasm lies in the understated way of presenting a dire warning.",1,"based on the input text, here's my analysis:

        Well he has further political aspirations..........The 9th circuit in Sodom (SF) is always making law instead of interpreting it........That is why they are over ruled so often.......

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the analysis of the input text, here are the extracted cues:

1. special symbols: excessive use of ellipsis (...........) multiple times
2. language style: informal, opinionated
3. cultural background: references to us politics and judicial system
4. punctuation: overuse of ellipsis as sentence breaks
5. keywords: 9th circuit, sodom (sf), political aspirations, overruled

### brief response:
the text uses exaggerated punctuation and loaded language to express disapproval of the 9th circuit court, implying corruption and poor judgment. the reference to ""sodom (sf)"" is particularly charged, suggesting a negative view of san francisco's perceived liberal values. while critical, the text does not appear to be using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant.

### label: not sarcastic",0,"### brief response:

cues:
1. emotional words: ""sodom"" (used negatively to refer to san francisco)
2. common knowledge: reference to 9th circuit court and its reputation
3. keywords: ""political aspirations"", ""making law"", ""interpreting it"", ""overruled""
4. punctuation: excessive use of ellipses (.........)
5. context: criticism of a political figure and the 9th circuit court

### label: sarcastic

the text uses exaggeration, loaded language, and implied criticism, which are indicators of sarcasm. the use of ""sodom"" to refer to san francisco and the implication that the 9th circuit court consistently makes improper rulings are particularly sarcastic elements.",1,"based on analyzing the input text, here is my assessment:

### brief response:

cues extracted:
1. language style: informal, uses excessive ellipses
2. common knowledge: reference to 9th circuit court, san francisco, judicial overreach
3. topic: criticism of 9th circuit court decisions
4. emotional contrasts: disdainful tone towards san francisco and the court
5. keywords: ""9th circuit"", ""sodom"", ""making law"", ""overruled""

the text uses exaggerated language and derogatory references (calling san francisco ""sodom"") to mock and criticize the 9th circuit court. the tone is clearly sarcastic and not meant to be taken literally.

without additional context, this short statement doesn't provide enough information to confidently detect sarcasm. the phrase ""certainly it does"" could be a straightforward, sincere agreement or a sarcastic response depending on the surrounding conversation and tone.

        Damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge. Do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?   While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang', he was mocking it. Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe, which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence.   FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.

"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense.

If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Extract the following cues: punctuation, surface emotion, keywords, language style, context from the Input text, to assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].'''
        
        ### Input:
        A more precise term would be ""broaden,"" since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, ""diluted"" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only ""change"" would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only ""change"" in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.   The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.

        Actually it couldn't be any worse then it is right now. More people historically have died at the hands of religious wars then non-religion. Religion has been used to push extreme political viewpoints, selfishness, racism, destruction of whole cultures, hatred, and ignorance. Wow that's something for you to be proud of eh grizzly6626? Through religion, televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity. While I haven't seen any atheists with bombs strapped to themselves, we've all see plenty of religious fools blowing themselves up each and every day. And of course we all know how peaceful and charitable The Spanish Inquisition was. I guess it's true, when it comes to religion IGNORANCE is bliss...   BTW - you forgot to mention that hitler was a devout catholic.   Yeah, like I said before, it couldn't be any worse then it is right now

"Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells ""tuned"" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths.

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the analysis of the input text, here are the extracted cues:

keywords: m4, acog scope, m16, ak, zombies, home defense, preparedness, constitutional rights

punctuation: excessive use of ellipses (...), occasional misspellings and grammatical errors

context: the text appears to be a detailed description of someone's home defense arsenal and preparedness strategy

topic: firearms, home defense, and preparedness for potential threats

cultural background: american gun culture, second amendment rights, prepper mentality

given these cues, the text doesn't appear to be sarcastic. the author seems to be earnestly describing their weaponry and preparedness measures, even if the level of detail might seem extreme to some readers. the final comparison with ""vor"" (presumably another user) has a mocking tone but doesn't make the entire text sarcastic.

label: not sarcastic",0,"based on the input text, here's my analysis:

surface emotion: pride, assertiveness

cultural background: american gun culture, prepper mentality

emotional contrasts: none significant

language style:
- highly technical and detailed descriptions of weapons
- boastful tone about weaponry and preparedness
- condescending towards others with different approaches

keywords:
""m4"", ""acog scope"", ""zombies"", ""ak"", ""bugout bag"", ""moa"", ""caucasian mountain dog"", ""preparedness"", ""constitutional rights""

while the text is excessively detailed and could be seen as over-the-top, it doesn't contain clear markers of sarcasm such as irony, exaggeration for comic effect, or mocking tone. the author appears to be genuinely proud of their arsenal and preparedness.

label: not sarcastic",0,"based on the input text, i would classify this as:

label: not sarcastic

here are the key cues i extracted:

1. language style:

   - use of military/gun jargon and specific measurements

2. emotional words:
   - ""preparedness""
   - ""constitutional rights violator""
   - ""law abiding citizen""

3. common knowledge:
   - references to various weapons and their specifications
   - mentions of home defense strategies
   - contrast between being prepared vs. unprepared

4. cultural background:
   - strong emphasis on gun ownership and self-defense
   - reference to constitutional rights (likely 2nd amendment)

while there is a slight mocking tone towards ""vor"" at the end, the overall text appears to be a sincere and detailed account of the author's home defense setup. the level of specificity and technical knowledge displayed suggests the author is genuinely invested in the topic rather than using sarcasm.",0,0

based on the given input, i don't have enough context or cues to confidently classify this as sarcastic. the sentence alone doesn't contain clear indicators of sarcasm such as emotional contrasts, exaggerated language, or contextual clues. it appears to be a straightforward question, possibly directed at a parrot named polly.

2. topic: pregnancy or abortion
3. common knowledge: debates around abortion often focus on trimesters
4. emotional contrasts: casual tone (""dunno"") contrasts with serious topic
5. surface emotion: feigned uncertainty or ignorance

### label: sarcastic

the casual ""i dunno"" and ""maybe"" paired with a precise medical term ""third trimester"" suggests a sarcastic response, likely to a question about when life begins or when abortion should be restricted. the speaker is probably mocking the idea of arbitrarily defining such a moment.",1,"### brief response:

cues:
1. rhetorical devices: the question is likely rhetorical, not expecting a genuine answer.
2. punctuation: use of a question mark for a statement that's not a true inquiry.
3. emotional contrasts: the casual ""i dunno"" contrasts with the specific medical terminology.
4. special symbols: none present.
5. emotional words: ""dunno"" suggests a casual, potentially dismissive tone.

the statement implies absurdity by suggesting precise knowledge of fetal development while simultaneously expressing uncertainty. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

3. special symbols: ellipsis (...), quotation marks
4. emotional words: ""bootlicking""
5. keywords: ""inalienable right,"" ""islamic jihad,"" ""al queda,"" ""weapons of mass destruction""

the text uses rhetorical questions and extreme examples to challenge the concept of absolute rights. the tone is mildly sarcastic, especially evident in the ""bootlicking"" reference and the request to ""drop the rhetoric.""

### label: sarcastic",1,"based on analyzing the input text, here are the key cues i extracted:

context: discussion about rights, freedoms, and government restrictions
cultural background: debate on political philosophy and individual liberties
common knowledge: references to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction
keywords: ""inalienable right"", ""islamic jihad"", ""al qaeda"", ""weapons of mass destruction"", ""bootlicking""
language style: questioning, skeptical, slightly mocking tone

the text uses exaggerated examples and a skeptical tone to challenge the idea of absolute rights, suggesting an undercurrent of sarcasm. however, it also seems to be genuinely asking for clarification.

### label: sarcastic

while there are elements of sarcasm, particularly in the extreme example used, the overall intent seems to be to genuinely question and debate the concept rather than purely mock it. however, the sarcastic undertones are strong enough to justify this classification.",1,"### brief response:

based on the cues extracted from the input text:

1. surface emotion: skepticism and challenge
2. emotional words: ""interesting"", ""clearly"", ""please""
3. emotional contrasts: none apparent
4. special symbols: ellipsis (...), question marks
5. topic: rights, limitations on freedom, terrorism

the text appears to be questioning and challenging a previous statement about rights, using examples to point out potential flaws in the argument. the tone is skeptical and mildly confrontational, but not overtly sarcastic.

cues extracted:
- emotional contrast: apparent agreement (""good for you"") contrasts with implied criticism
- surface emotion: false praise/approval
- punctuation: use of question mark for rhetorical effect
- rhetorical devices: rhetorical question, condescension

the text uses a rhetorical question followed by seemingly positive statements that actually convey a mocking tone. the apparent praise ""good for you. you're getting it."" is clearly meant sarcastically to criticize the other person's viewpoint.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### brief response:

based on the cues extracted from the input text, i would classify this as sarcastic.

cues:
1. context: the text appears to be a response to someone's statement about public opinion on gay marriage.
2. emotional contrast: the initial question seems critical, but is followed by unexpected praise.
3. rhetorical device: the question is likely rhetorical, not seeking a genuine answer.
4. common knowledge: there's an implied understanding of the debate around gay marriage and majority vs. minority rights.
5. emotional words: ""good for you"" - typically positive but used sarcastically here.

the phrase ""you're getting it"" at the end, following the seemingly critical question, creates a sarcastic tone. it implies that the person is finally understanding something obvious, which is a common sarcastic technique.

"Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents.

"Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen.

        ### Input:
        Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there.

        ### Label: 

        ","Input: ""well that explains your anger.   i hope you are blessed with homeliness. makes your commitment easier to keep. how old are you now?""

Cues:
1. punctuation: short sentences with periods suggest a blunt, matter-of-fact tone often used in sarcasm.
2. keywords:
   - ""blessed with homeliness"" - an oxymoron, as homeliness is typically not considered a blessing
   - ""commitment easier to keep"" - implies a negative view of the person's appearance
3. cultural background: in many cultures, commenting on someone's appearance negatively is considered rude, so doing so indirectly can be a form of sarcasm.
4. common knowledge: being ""homely"" is generally not seen as desirable, so wishing it upon someone is likely not sincere.
5. special symbols: none present, but the lack of emojis or softening language reinforces the sarcastic tone.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Extract the following cues: context, keywords, topic, punctuation, special symbols from the Input text, to assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].'''
        
        ### Input:
        The guys who want guns in their homes to protect themselves from burglars or ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" call others full of fear and mistrust?

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the input text, here are the extracted cues:

surface emotion: incredulity, mockery
keywords: ""guns"", ""protect"", ""burglars"", ""revolution"", ""fear"", ""mistrust""
common knowledge: debates about gun ownership and self-defense in the us
topic: gun ownership justifications and perceived hypocrisy
punctuation: question mark, quotation marks for emphasis

### brief response:
the text uses irony to point out a perceived contradiction in the stance of gun advocates, implying that their own arguments stem from fear while they accuse others of the same. the use of quotation marks around ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" suggests mockery of this viewpoint.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### brief response:

cues:
1. context: gun control debate, questioning logic of pro-gun arguments
2. topic: gun ownership, home protection, revolution
3. special symbols: quotation marks around ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution""
4. keywords: guns, protect, burglars, revolution, fear, mistrust
5. emotional words: none explicitly, but tone implies skepticism and irony
6. rhetorical device: rhetorical question highlighting perceived hypocrisy

### label: sarcastic",1,"### brief response:

based on the extracted cues, this statement appears to be sarcastic.

cues:
1. context: the statement is comparing gun owners' justifications with their criticism of others.
2. keywords: ""protect themselves,"" ""revolution,"" ""fear and mistrust""
3. topic: gun ownership and perceived hypocrisy
4. punctuation: question mark at the end, suggesting a rhetorical question
5. special symbols: quotation marks around ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" to highlight the absurdity of the statement

the text implies an ironic contradiction between gun owners' actions (wanting guns for protection or potential revolution) and their criticism of others as being fearful and mistrustful. this juxtaposition is a classic hallmark of sarcasm.

based on the given input, i'll analyze the cues:

1. surface emotion: enthusiasm (exclamation mark)
2. context: insufficient context provided, but implies a comparison to a playstation
3. emotional contrasts: none apparent
4. keywords: ""of course"" - often used in sarcastic statements
5. common knowledge: playstations are generally considered desirable or expensive, so something being ""less than a playstation"" is not typically emphasized as a positive

the phrase ""of course!"" adds a tone that suggests the statement might not be sincere. without more context, it's difficult to be certain, but the combination of these cues leans towards a sarcastic interpretation.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### brief response:

based on the provided input, i'll analyze the cues:

1. surface emotion: enthusiastic or excited tone
2. emotional words: none explicitly present
3. common knowledge: implicit reference to playstation being expensive
4. language style: casual, exclamatory
5. emotional contrasts: contrast between the casual tone and the implication of something being cheap

the phrase implies that something is cheaper than a playstation, which is typically considered an expensive item. the exclamation and ""of course!"" suggest an exaggerated or insincere enthusiasm about this fact, indicating sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### brief response:

cues extracted:
1. keywords: ""less than"", ""of course!""
2. topic: comparing something to a playstation (gaming console)
3. punctuation: exclamation mark at the end
4. emotional words: none explicitly present
5. common knowledge: playstations are generally considered expensive gaming devices

the phrase ""of course!"" adds a tone of obviousness or sarcasm to the statement. without more context, it seems the speaker is implying that something is cheaper than a playstation in a way that suggests this should be obvious or expected, potentially mocking the idea.

        Because his, as a Christian, doesn't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does.   ""Quote mine"" - looks like that will be a common acusation here. If I keep things concise and readable, I'm quote mining. That quote wasn't about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution, far more than ""believers"" (creationists)   And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.   Again, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying.   No, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to ""correct"" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6. Miller didn't misinterpret him at all. In note #47, Lewontin even mentioned the NY Times!   Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools. We have to more and more, as atheism is established.   It's a deal, if you'll put a hold on lecturing me about reading comprension as you ignore very relevant notes in the rear of the book.   The one where he bragged about defeating Henry Morris, a Christian? (pp 172, 173)   Sure they were, Christians are always opposing Christianity! All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!   And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.   Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited.   So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about ""preachers"", he wasn't referring to priests? I've seen it all now.   As I said, I hope to learn if all theistic evolution does not believe in original sin. I'd like to know if all Catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale.

        ","Input: ""well that explains your anger.   i hope you are blessed with homeliness. makes your commitment easier to keep. how old are you now?""

Cues:
1. punctuation: short sentences with periods suggest a blunt, matter-of-fact tone often used in sarcasm.
2. keywords:
   - ""blessed with homeliness"" - an oxymoron, as homeliness is typically not considered a blessing
   - ""commitment easier to keep"" - implies a negative view of the person's appearance
3. cultural background: in many cultures, commenting on someone's appearance negatively is considered rude, so doing so indirectly can be a form of sarcasm.
4. common knowledge: being ""homely"" is generally not seen as desirable, so wishing it upon someone is likely not sincere.
5. special symbols: none present, but the lack of emojis or softening language reinforces the sarcastic tone.

        ### Input:
        And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the input text, here's my analysis:

### brief response:

language style: factual, concise
emotional words: none present
topic: gun control legislation (dunblane handgun ban)
keywords: ""post-dunblane handgun ban"", ""only one event""
punctuation: standard, period at the end

the text appears to be a straightforward statement without obvious markers of sarcasm. it's comparing the speed of legislative action after a single event (dunblane) to an implied slower or non-existent action in another context. while this could potentially be used sarcastically in a broader context, the statement itself doesn't contain clear sarcastic cues.

### label: not sarcastic",0,"### brief response:

cues:
1. cultural background: references dunblane (a mass shooting event in scotland in 1996) and subsequent handgun ban, indicating knowledge of uk gun policy history.
2. rhetorical devices: use of ""and yet"" to introduce a contrasting idea, implying criticism or irony.
3. topic: gun control legislation and its implementation.
4. surface emotion: subtle frustration or criticism.
5. context: likely part of a larger discussion about gun control measures and their triggers.

### label: sarcastic

the use of ""and yet"" coupled with pointing out that a significant policy change occurred after just one event suggests a sarcastic tone. the speaker appears to be critically commenting on the swiftness of action in the dunblane case, possibly in contrast to inaction in other contexts.",1,"based on the input text, here's my analysis:

### brief response:

cues:
1. topic: gun control legislation, specifically referencing the dunblane massacre and subsequent handgun ban in the uk
2. language style: matter-of-fact, slightly formal
3. common knowledge: assumes familiarity with the dunblane event and its impact on gun laws
4. emotional contrasts: none apparent
5. special symbols: none

the statement doesn't contain clear markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone. it appears to be a straightforward comment on how quickly gun legislation changed after a single event.

cues extracted:
1. emotional contrast: positive ""yep"" followed by absurd suggestion
2. keywords: ""suppressing"", ""natural behavior""
3. rhetorical devices: exaggeration, false agreement
4. context: comparing natural behavior to pooping
5. special symbols: none, but the extreme statement serves a similar purpose

the text uses exaggeration and false agreement to mock the idea of suppressing natural behavior, drawing an absurd parallel with stopping bodily functions like pooping.

### label: sarcastic",1,"### brief response:

based on the input text, i've identified the following cues:

1. punctuation: normal usage, no special patterns.

2. context: discussing suppression of natural behavior, with an absurd suggestion.

3. language style: casual, conversational tone.

4. keywords: ""suppressing natural behavior"", ""always the way to go"", ""stop pooping""

5. rhetorical devices: 
   - hyperbole: suggesting to stop a fundamental bodily function (pooping)
   - false agreement: ""yep"" followed by an absurd statement

these cues, particularly the exaggerated suggestion and false agreement, strongly indicate sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1,"based on the input, here's my analysis:

rhetorical devices: exaggeration, false equivalence (comparing behavior suppression to stopping pooping)
surface emotion: mock enthusiasm/agreement

the statement is clearly sarcastic, using exaggeration and an absurd comparison to criticize the idea of suppressing natural behaviors.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Extract the following cues: common knowledge, special symbols, surface emotion, language style, punctuation from the Input text, to assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].'''
        
        ### Input:
        So will they be in front of or behind a leaf?

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the given input, here is my analysis:

### brief response:

cues extracted:
- topic: unclear/ambiguous positioning relative to a leaf
- special symbols: none
- emotional words: none
- common knowledge: leaves are typically small, so being in front of or behind one is an odd distinction
- emotional contrasts: none present

the text is too short and ambiguous to confidently detect sarcasm. without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is a genuine question or a sarcastic remark.

### label: not sarcastic

while the question could potentially be interpreted sarcastically in a specific context, there isn't enough information in the provided text alone to definitively classify it as sarcastic. therefore, the safer classification is ""not sarcastic"" based on the limited input.",0,"### brief response:

cues extracted:
1. cultural background: none specifically evident
2. common knowledge: implies something is usually hidden behind or in front of a leaf
3. special symbols: none
4. topic: positioning or visibility of something in relation to a leaf
5. language style: short, simple question with a hint of absurdity

the question seems to be poking fun at the idea of something being hidden by a leaf, which is typically too small to conceal much. the absurdity of the question suggests a sarcastic tone.

### label: sarcastic",1,"based on the given input, i'll analyze it for sarcasm cues:

### brief response:

common knowledge: no clear reference to widely known information.
special symbols: none present.
surface emotion: neutral, no strong emotion evident.
language style: simple, straightforward question.
punctuation: standard question mark usage.

the text lacks clear indicators of sarcasm. it appears to be a genuine, straightforward question without any obvious sarcastic undertones.

        ### Input:
        So you're a historian now?   Yes, you are right - the Civil War was fought to keep the union in tact. But, it is also a fact that Abraham Lincoln, the Commander in Chief of the Union Army, did not believe that the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   According to who? Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness, it in no way follows that all men are not created equal.   Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.

        ### Label: 

        ","Input: ""well that explains your anger.   i hope you are blessed with homeliness. makes your commitment easier to keep. how old are you now?""

Cues:
1. punctuation: short sentences with periods suggest a blunt, matter-of-fact tone often used in sarcasm.
2. keywords:
   - ""blessed with homeliness"" - an oxymoron, as homeliness is typically not considered a blessing
   - ""commitment easier to keep"" - implies a negative view of the person's appearance
3. cultural background: in many cultures, commenting on someone's appearance negatively is considered rude, so doing so indirectly can be a form of sarcasm.
4. common knowledge: being ""homely"" is generally not seen as desirable, so wishing it upon someone is likely not sincere.
5. special symbols: none present, but the lack of emojis or softening language reinforces the sarcastic tone.

2. emotional words: ""impossible"", ""poof!"", ""goddidit!""

4. common knowledge: basic physics principles, limitations of wood as a building material

5. keywords: ""laws of physics"", ""physical limits"", ""flexing"", ""miracle"", ""creationist"", ""mythology""

the text uses a sarcastic tone to critique the scientific plausibility of noah's ark. the author employs exaggerated language and rhetorical questions to mock the idea of miraculous intervention (""poof! goddidit!""). the concluding sentences about god's motivations and noah getting drunk further emphasize the sarcastic approach to discussing this topic.",1,"based on analyzing the input text, here is my assessment:

5. emotional contrasts: serious scientific explanation vs mocking religious explanations

the text uses sarcasm to criticize creationist explanations for noah's ark, contrasting scientific reasoning with mockery of miraculous explanations. the tone becomes increasingly sarcastic, culminating in the ""poof! goddidit!"" phrase and the final jab about noah getting drunk. this combination of factual arguments and mocking tone indicates the text",1,"based on the input text, i would classify this as:

        ### Input:
        You believe that your interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than his, and he believes that his interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than yours. This is quite simple, but that's never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.   No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   ""Concise and readable"" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his ""citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts.""   I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the ""on"" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this ""power,"" too:marc is an atheist.

1. punctuation: short sentences with periods suggest a blunt, matter-of-fact tone often used in sarcasm.
2. keywords:
   - ""blessed with homeliness"" - an oxymoron, as homeliness is typically not considered a blessing
   - ""commitment easier to keep"" - implies a negative view of the person's appearance
3. cultural background: in many cultures, commenting on someone's appearance negatively is considered rude, so doing so indirectly can be a form of sarcasm.
4. common knowledge: being ""homely"" is generally not seen as desirable, so wishing it upon someone is likely not sincere.
5. special symbols: none present, but the lack of emojis or softening language reinforces the sarcastic tone.

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the input text, i'll analyze the cues and provide a label:

### brief response:

cues:
1. context: the phrase ""i was correcting you"" implies a confrontational tone.
2. common knowledge: the expression ""that's the breaks"" is an idiom meaning ""that's how things are, deal with it.""
3. rhetorical devices: none apparent.
4. punctuation: standard use, no special emphasis.
5. special symbols: none present.

the text appears to be a direct, somewhat dismissive statement rather than sarcastic. there's no clear indication of irony or mocking tone that would suggest sarcasm.

### label: not sarcastic",0,"based on the provided input, here's my analysis:

### brief response:

cues:
1. rhetorical devices: dismissive tone, implying superiority
2. cultural background: english-speaking, informal language use
3. special symbols: none
4. punctuation: standard use of periods
5. topic: correction or disagreement in conversation

### label: not sarcastic

the statement is direct and somewhat confrontational, but it doesn't contain clear markers of sarcasm. it appears to be a straightforward, albeit somewhat brusque, response to a previous interaction.",0,"### brief response:

cues:
1. keywords: ""correcting"", ""offended"", ""that's the breaks""
2. emotional contrast: assertive tone vs. dismissive ending
3. topic: interpersonal communication/disagreement
4. rhetorical devices: conditional statement (""if you are offended..."")
5. cultural background: colloquial phrase ""that's the breaks"" suggesting indifference
6. language style: direct, unapologetic

### label: sarcastic

the combination of the assertive correction with the dismissive ""that's the breaks"" phrase suggests a sarcastic tone, implying a lack of concern for the other person's feelings about being corrected.",1,0

Cues:
1. punctuation: short sentences with periods suggest a blunt, matter-of-fact tone often used in sarcasm.
2. keywords:
   - ""blessed with homeliness"" - an oxymoron, as homeliness is typically not considered a blessing
   - ""commitment easier to keep"" - implies a negative view of the person's appearance
3. cultural background: in many cultures, commenting on someone's appearance negatively is considered rude, so doing so indirectly can be a form of sarcasm.
4. common knowledge: being ""homely"" is generally not seen as desirable, so wishing it upon someone is likely not sincere.
5. special symbols: none present, but the lack of emojis or softening language reinforces the sarcastic tone.

3. cultural background: in many cultures, commenting on someone's appearance negatively is considered rude, so doing so indirectly can be a form of sarcasm.
4. common knowledge: being ""homely"" is generally not seen as desirable, so wishing it upon someone is likely not sincere.
5. special symbols: none present, but the lack of emojis or softening language reinforces the sarcastic tone.

Cues:
1. punctuation: short sentences with periods suggest a blunt, matter-of-fact tone often used in sarcasm.
2. keywords:
   - ""blessed with homeliness"" - an oxymoron, as homeliness is typically not considered a blessing
   - ""commitment easier to keep"" - implies a negative view of the person's appearance
3. cultural background: in many cultures, commenting on someone's appearance negatively is considered rude, so doing so indirectly can be a form of sarcasm.
4. common knowledge: being ""homely"" is generally not seen as desirable, so wishing it upon someone is likely not sincere.
5. special symbols: none present, but the lack of emojis or softening language reinforces the sarcastic tone.

        ### Input:
        You need to experiment with the notion that you will be sexually attracted to your own sex. After you're done, come back and report your findings!

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the input text, here is my analysis:

### brief response:

cues:
1. language style: commanding, provocative tone
2. topic: sexual orientation experimentation
3. emotional contrasts: casual suggestion of a sensitive topic
4. context: implies the recipient can simply choose to change their sexual orientation
5. special symbols: exclamation mark for emphasis

the text appears to be mockingly suggesting someone can easily change their sexual orientation through experimentation, which is not how sexual orientation works. the casual tone about a serious topic and the implication of reporting back as if it's a simple task indicate sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic",1,"based on the input text, here are the extracted cues:

context: the statement appears to be a directive or suggestion to someone, possibly in response to a discussion about sexual orientation.

emotional contrasts: there's a contrast between the serious topic of sexual attraction and the casual tone of ""come back and report your findings!""

punctuation: the use of an exclamation mark at the end adds emphasis and a light-hearted tone to a potentially sensitive topic.

cultural background: the text implies a context where discussions about sexual orientation and experimentation are relevant.

topic: sexual orientation and experimentation.

given these cues, especially the contrast between the serious topic and the casual tone, as well as the implication that one can simply choose to be attracted to a particular sex, i would classify this as:

### label: sarcastic

1. topic: experimenting with sexual attraction to the same sex
2. emotional words: ""sexually attracted""
