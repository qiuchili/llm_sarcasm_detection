BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K.

This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity.

**cultural background:** the dialogue involves references to religious identities, specifically ""fundamentalist christian"" and ""christian agnostics,"" indicating that the cultural background is rooted in discussions about religious belief systems.
**topic:** the topic revolves around accurately summarizing a religious perspective and the inclusion of various christian subgroups, namely fundamentalist christians and christian agnostics.
**emotional contrasts:** there is an underlying sense of a call for inclusiveness or completeness in addressing the christian spectrum, reflecting a genuine concern rather than mockery or derision.
**rhetorical devices:** the question ""why don't you just sum it up with..."" can be seen as a rhetorical question aimed at prompting the listener to think about the exclusion of certain groups. however, it does not carry the sarcastic tone often marked by overt irony or significant emotional disparity.
**common knowledge:** it's known that religious discussions can encompass a vast array of beliefs and that excluding certain perspectives can be seen as an oversight. the mention of ""christian agnostics"" points to an awareness of nuance within religious identity.

BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336

        ### Label: 

        ","### cues:

- **cultural background:** the input is centered around a scientific debate on evolution, specifically concerning the ability of bacteria to digest nylon and its implications for evolutionary theory. this debate is rooted in both scientific literature and discussions from various forums and websites, including those with religious perspectives.

- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses analogies (comparing artificial hearts to new species), a series of question-based critiques (""what you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? natural what?""), appeals to authority with references to scientific literature, and incorporates quotations to reinforce the argument. there's also a notable use of mocking and sarcastic tone, particularly in statements like ""i suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear"" and ""talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk"".

- **special symbols:** no special symbols are present.

- **emotional contrasts:** there's an apparent frustration or mockery towards the opponent's view, indicated by dismissive and sarcastic remarks.

- **topic:** the topic centers around the interpretation of specific scientific phenomena (nylon-eating bacteria) and their implications for evolutionary theory versus alternate perspectives.

        ### Input:
        But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution, which is based on lies and deceptions, they prove right there that they haven't enough knowledge of the truth, nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie. So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend?   I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.   So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it.

We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills). This fact does not diminish the lies told by Al Gore...the ones that got him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, both of which become more meaningless each year.

The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming. The Government's expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.   2.	The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was “not possible?to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.	The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.   5.	The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.   11.	The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand. The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.   Stay tuned as the UK High Court's final ruling may impose additional restrictions on teaching An Inconvenient Truth in classes. They may also point out additional inaccuracies as we all know they only scratched the surface above.   http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php?extend.24   http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles...polarbears.htm   http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=3400   http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=11548   http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1350746/posts

        ### Input:
        Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say ""What might be the best...""   Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","### brief response:
the input text appears to contain an involved argument in response to a challenge about understanding 'pain.' the tone seems to be formal and measured, with a touch of frustration or irritation hinted at the insistence on measurable information about pain.

### cues:
- **emotional contrasts:** mild frustration or irritation, but no overt emotional outburst.
- **punctuation:** consistent use of commas and quotation marks for clarity in expressing arguments. the use of quotation marks around phrases like ""what might be the best..."" suggests a request for exact wording.
- **language style:** formal and structured. sentences are well-constructed and articulate.
- **special symbols:** quotation marks are used to indicate paraphrased speech or to highlight specific terms.

**cultural background:** the text appears to engage in a discussion likely rooted in academic or scientific discourse, where the challenge pertains to knowledge and measurement of ""pain.""

**topic:** the challenge of understanding and quantifying aspects of pain within the scientific community.

**common knowledge:** it is generally known that pain is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is not fully understood and cannot be completely measured or quantified with current knowledge and technology.

### label: not sarcastic",0,"### brief response:

- emotional contrasts: the text conveys a mild sense of defensiveness and justification, contrasting with the neutral, objective tone often found in purely factual discussions.
- rhetorical devices: use of quotation marks around ""you can measure"" indicates a potentially sarcastic tone, questioning the premise. phrases like ""at present we are not at a stage"" and ""therefore in the current climate"" seem to undermine the certainty of the challenge. the phrase ""i have met the majority of your challenge"" also implies a sense of contention.
- cultural background: the text seems to address a scientific or academic discussion about the nature of pain, measurement, and possibly research challenges.
- keywords: ""measure,"" ""pain,"" ""challenge,"" ""current climate,"" ""down the track.""
- surface emotion: defensive, possibly frustrated or exasperated.

"Some apply logic, some do not. So much for contradictory thinking.   What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind? Hold the mythology, please.   from infidels.org -   The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ""the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference."" Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.   It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.

        ### Input:
        Sure.   The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.   Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.   Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.   And, of course the US Supreme Court agrees with this, thus ruling that per the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, the woman has the right to privacy, to control her onw body.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Extract the following cues: language style, common knowledge, rhetorical devices, punctuation, cultural background from the Input text, to assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].'''
        
        ### Input:
        Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.

        Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards.

**cultural background:** in western culture, discussing evolution and theology often brings about strong opinions and can be rife with sarcastic commentary, especially in public forums.

### brief response:
the text contains elements of sarcasm, especially toward the end, where the speaker challenges the other person's viewpoint with a dismissive attitude.

### label: 
sarcastic",1,"### cues:

- **rhetorical devices:** 
  - **sarcasm:** ""you're looking at evolution in way too much of a magical and mystical way."" this comment implies incredulity and mockery.
  - **irony:** ""science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out.""
  - **exaggeration:** ""the ineffable will of god.""
  - **dismissal:** ""but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you.""

- **language style:**
  - informal language with contractions and lowercase first-person ""i.""
  - use of ellipses to indicate omitted thoughts or a trailing off: ""it doesn't have any desires... and... i lack the eloquence...""
  - colloquial phrases like: ""you do research,"" ""go ahead,"" and ""easy debate victory.""

- **cultural background:**
  - knowledge of evolution and scientific attempts to explain natural phenomena.
  - familiarity with common arguments between the proponents of evolutionary science and the proponents of intelligent design or creationism.

- **punctuation:**
  - ellipses are used to show pauses or omitted thoughts.
  - lower",1,"### cues:

1. **punctuation:** the text uses ellipses frequently, contributing to a disjointed and casual tone.
2. **surface emotion:** the surface emotion appears to be one of condescension or annoyance, particularly towards the end of the text.
3. **common knowledge:** refers to the general scientific understanding of evolution and the ongoing debate about the existence and role of a god in creation.
4. **cultural background:** there is an allusion to the debate between science and religion, particularly in the context of evolution and intelligent design.
5. **special symbols:** the use of ellipses breaks up sentences and adds a dismissive tone.

### brief response:
the writer's tone carries a sense of condescension and mockery towards individuals who argue for intelligent design over evolution. the repetitive use of ellipses contributes to a sense that the writer is hardly taking the argument seriously or is highlighting perceived flaws in the opposing view.

Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.

so a free society is one where the government does not have tabs on their citizens? how could then the government work when it does not know who they actually govern? the foundation of economics is that you have correct data, else it’s the beginning of corruption not freedom. and since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism? further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects? wouldn’t it be rather more risk to be rounded up if you couldn’t identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation?

        Damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge. Do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?   While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang', he was mocking it. Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe, which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence.   FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.

so a free society is one where the government does not have tabs on their citizens? how could then the government work when it does not know who they actually govern? the foundation of economics is that you have correct data, else it’s the beginning of corruption not freedom. and since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism? further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects? wouldn’t it be rather more risk to be rounded up if you couldn’t identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation?

2. **emotional contrasts:** the statement acknowledges that the people in question are ""pretty anti-anything education,"" implying a general opposition, and then contrasts this with the expectation (or lack thereof) that these people would argue logically. the contrast between what is expected and what is presented supports a sarcastic tone.
3. **topic:** the topic revolves around people who are against education and the expectation of logical arguments from them.
4. **special symbols:** none observed in the text.
5. **rhetorical devices:** there is an implied irony in stating that expecting sense from those who are ""anti-anything education"" is unreasonable. this expectation itself is contrasted ironically in the final sentence.

- common knowledge: the statement references widely accepted societal issues such as shootings and illegal activities, playing on the notion that laws are already in place against such behaviors.
- language style: the text uses a dismissive and seemingly logical argumentative style to base an exaggerated truth, typical in sarcastic language.
- keywords: ""actually,"" ""illegal,"" ""criminals,"" ""stabbings,"" ""gun happy nuts.""
- emotional words: ""nobody has ever been injured,"" ""gun happy nuts running around,"" shows elements of sarcasm and exaggeration.
- rhetorical devices: rhetorical questions (""do stabbings count?"" ""are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?"") and hyperbole (""nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around"").

        Why you quoted me is questionable. What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of ****. How you consider mathematical equations ""mockery"" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video. Instead, in your normal fashion, you simply ASSUMED what you wanted to believe and then went from there rather then actually looking at what it was and what it had to say.   Your post more accurately is towards the link that AA posted in defense of his beliefs (yet failed to realize was satirizing those beliefs). Furthermore, I'm not an atheist even though your poor definition wants me to be.

        ### Brief Response:

- **cultural background**: the text delves into debates about mathematical proof, logical reasoning, and beliefs, indicating cultural tensions within scientific and possibly religious contexts.
- **emotional contrasts**: the writer transitions from discussing their own logical argument to criticizing the other person's assumptions and readiness to believe without analyzing the facts. this shift highlights frustration and a mocking undertone.
- **topic**: the main topic centers around the refutation of claims (presumably religious or pseudoscientific) by presenting mathematical evidence and logical arguments.
- **language style**: the language is confrontational and critical, with an emphasis on arguing against the other person's approach and beliefs. words like ""assumed"" (capitalized for emphasis) and phrases like ""rather then actually looking at what it was"" suggest a disdainful and derisive tone.
- **punctuation**: use of quotation marks around ""mockery,"" capitalization for emphasis (""assumed""), and asterisks (****) to censor the word underscores the emotional intensity and argumentative nature of the text.

2. **punctuation:** the use of a question mark indicates inquiry but also can imply incredulity or challenge.
3. **special symbols:** none observed in the text.
4. **language style:** the language is simple and direct, raising a rhetorical question that can imply skepticism or contradiction.

you have to be off for more than 4 days and after that i would get the princely sum of £79.15 per week..hardly worth having. unlike teachers i cannot stay at home and get paid when it snows too.

Cues:
- **punctuation**: the use of ""..hardly worth having"" and ellipsis suggests a trailing off in thought, emphasizing discontent.
- **emotional words**: ""princely sum"" is used sarcastically to imply that the amount is very low, despite the phrase suggesting otherwise.
- **context**: there is a comparison between the speaker's situation and that of teachers, with an implication of unfairness.
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""hardly worth having"" is understatement, and ""princely sum"" is ironic. there is also a hint of hyperbole in the portrayal of teachers' benefits.
- **common knowledge**: it is generally understood that teachers may have different job benefits, such as paid snow days, which can be contrasted with the speaker’s own situation.

        My first line of defense for up to 300 yards is an M4 (specops m16) flattop with an ACOG scope and tritium backup sights, 14.5 barrel with a 1/7 twist with mccluek (sp) muzzle brake to make it the legal 16 inches. foward pistol grip and a surefire light mounted to my knights RASII. I keep 45 grains in the clips so they frange and not penatrate walls. I keep a second clip with 77gr noslers in a mag-cinched clip for longer range shots. I use a long range Shephered scope on my .308 chambered m14 for shotting zombies out to 1000 yards. And to compliment my defensive ability I keep a romanian AK in my bugout bag with a surefire light and an OKO red dot scope for quick egress when reliability is of most importance and close range firefight is likley. (this in not to mention the plethora of pistoles and handguns I keep for home defense also). THe m4 is 1.5 MOA, The M14 (m1a) is sub MOA, and the AK is a typical 3-4moa. BTW. I have had military and civilian training in all of these weapons   I also keep a well trained Caucasian Mountain dog roaming the house at night so if anyone where to make it inside I doubt there would be anything left of him by the time I got there...   Preparedness my friends...   Now VoR probably keeps his Rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wifes neck and a fancy pug roaming the house...

        ### Input:
        So now you are saying that the earth doesn't move? I get it. The earth used to be fixed at the center of the universe when those Bible verses were written but God changed it. Now it orbits the sun like the other planets.   Actually, the verse does say that grasshoppers have four legs. There is no mention of jumping legs. You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error.   You ""interpret"" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.

yep. they're free to marry a member of the opposite sex just like any other american.

Cues:
1. **emotional contrasts:** the statement suggests a lack of freedom to marry someone of the same sex by implying that the current right to marry someone of the opposite sex is sufficient, which is often a contentious issue.

the use of rhetorical devices, sarcasm in pointing out",1,"### explanation:
upon analyzing the provided text for sarcasm cues, here are the detailed observations:

1. **language style:** 
   - the language employs a mix of direct questioning and assertions which hold an underlying tone of incredulity.

3. **emotional contrasts:** 
   - the statement contrasts belief in the bible's literal interpretation with the need to add additional explanations for it to make sense in light of modern knowledge.
   - highlighting discrepancies such as ""4 legs on a grasshopper"" and ""rabbits chewing cud"" serves to highlight perceived absurdity.

4. **punctuation:** 
   - use of periods and the series of assertions give each point a conclusive note.
   - the question ""so now you are saying that the earth doesn't move?"" clearly sets a skeptical tone in the opening line.

you have to be off for more than 4 days and after that i would get the princely sum of £79.15 per week..hardly worth having. unlike teachers i cannot stay at home and get paid when it snows too.

Cues:
- **punctuation**: the use of ""..hardly worth having"" and ellipsis suggests a trailing off in thought, emphasizing discontent.
- **emotional words**: ""princely sum"" is used sarcastically to imply that the amount is very low, despite the phrase suggesting otherwise.
- **context**: there is a comparison between the speaker's situation and that of teachers, with an implication of unfairness.
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""hardly worth having"" is understatement, and ""princely sum"" is ironic. there is also a hint of hyperbole in the portrayal of teachers' benefits.
- **common knowledge**: it is generally understood that teachers may have different job benefits, such as paid snow days, which can be contrasted with the speaker’s own situation.

That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument. How could anyone argue with your brand of logic? That would be senseless.

        ### Input:
        Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?

        ### Label: 

        ","### brief response:
to classify the input text as 'sarcastic' or 'not sarcastic,' we will analyze the rhetorical devices, cultural background, topic, emotional contrasts, and context.

#### rhetorical devices:
- analogy: the author compares gun control laws to regulations applicable to other domains (e.g., driving, prescription drugs) to highlight their viewpoint.
- counterargument: the text contains rebuttals to potential arguments against gun control.
- questioning: the use of rhetorical questions like ""what do you mean 'my ultimate agenda'?"" adds emphasis to the points being made.
  
#### cultural background:
- the american gun control debate: the text reflects cultural and societal issues related to the second amendment rights, regulatory policies, and public safety concerns in the united states.

#### topic:
- gun control advocacy: the author argues for reasonable gun control measures, likening them to other forms of regulation for public safety and well-being.

#### emotional contrasts:
- the tone remains relatively neutral and explanatory, aiming for logical and reasonable discourse rather than emotional appeal. 

#### context:
- the text appears to be part of a detailed argument or discussion around gun control, responding to opposition views and trying to clarify the author's standpoint.
  
### label:
not sar",0,"### brief response:

1. **context**: the text discusses the analogy between gun ownership regulations and regulations for other aspects, defending the reasonability and necessity of gun control laws. the speaker is addressing perceived misconceptions and explaining the logic behind their viewpoint on gun regulation.
  
2. **common knowledge**: gun control and the regulation of firearms are highly debated topics in the usa, often compared to regulations in other areas such as driving and prescription drugs. the second amendment and its interpretations are well-known points of contention in this debate.

3. **topic**: the primary topic is gun control and the comparison of regulations applicable to different activities and products to argue for similar reasonable restrictions on gun ownership.

4. **special symbols**: usage of ""::"" in the analogy and quotation marks ("" "") to emphasize specific terms, such as ""my ultimate agenda"" and ""well regulate.""

5. **punctuation**: capitalization for emphasis (e.g., ""relationship,"" ""not""), multiple colons for structuring comparisons, and ellipsis for indicating continuation of thought.

based on these cues, the text employs analogies, structured explanations, and emphasis to build a logical case rather than using irony or sarcasm.

### label:

        Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there.

No, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to ""correct"" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6. Miller didn't misinterpret him at all. In note #47, Lewontin even mentioned the NY Times!   Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools.

The one where he bragged about defeating Henry Morris, a Christian? (pp 172, 173)   Sure they were, Christians are always opposing Christianity! All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!   And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.   Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited.   So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about ""preachers"", he wasn't referring to priests? I've seen it all now.   As I said, I hope to learn if all theistic evolution does not believe in original sin. I'd like to know if all Catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale.

periods are used to end declarative statements. there is also an apostrophe in ""it's"" indicating a contraction, which should likely be ""its"" (indicating possession).

### cultural background:
the text references the debate around lgbt rights, the perception of gay lobby groups, and the treatment of christians in canada.

### rhetorical devices:
1. **comparative statement (""...most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech"")** versus implicit suggestion that opponents define it as hate speech.
2. **accusatory tone:** ""you've been listening to too much propaganda from gay lobby groups"" implies that the listener's views are invalid due to propaganda.
3. **conditional statement:** ""if canada limited its persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem.""

### label:
not sarcastic",0,"### brief response: 

**extracted cues:**
- **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts the notion of speech about homosexuality as not being hate speech with the portrayal of gay lobby groups as propaganda-spreading entities that persecute christians.
- **punctuation**: the use of a period indicates a definitive statement, but overall the punctuation isn't a major indicator of sarcasm here.
- **cultural background**: the text refers to societal and cultural issues regarding homosexuality, free speech, and perceived persecution, particularly in the context of canada and christians.
- **emotional words**: words like ""propaganda,"" ""demonizing,"" ""persecuting,"" and ""problem"" are charged with emotional weight, conveying a strong opinion and sense of conflict.
- **surface emotion**: the surface emotion is defensive and accusatory, with elements of anger and frustration.

### label: not sarcastic",0,"### brief response:

- **emotional contrasts**: the text implies a contrast between the perceived reasonableness of most speech about homosexuality and the ""propaganda"" from gay lobby groups.
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of phrases like ""too much propaganda"" and ""best means to an end"" suggest a demeaning tone towards the gay lobby groups.
- **context**: the discussion centers around societal attitudes toward homosexuality and the perceived persecution of christians.
- **common knowledge**: the argument that gay lobby groups are demonizing christians for their beliefs is a common trope in some conservative discussions.
- **special symbols**: none notable, punctuation and grammar appear straightforward.

#### emotional contrasts:
the text contrasts ignorance ('never heard of it before') with the suggestion that the term is so obscure that even the dictionary is unaware of it.

#### punctuation:
the use of quotation marks around ""euthanization"" hints at skepticism or mockery. additionally, the period ending each sentence contributes to a flat, dismissive tone.

#### topic:
the topic is the term ""euthanization,"" a formal or clinical term typically associated with ending a life humanely, often used in medical or animal contexts.

#### context:
the context suggests surprise or disbelief regarding the term ""euthanization,"" implying such surprise is unwarranted by acting as if the phrase and its meaning are not common knowledge.

- **quotations:** used to imply disbelief or ridicule.

### explanation:
the classification of ""sarcastic"" is based on the following cues:

- **emotional contrasts:** the statement ""never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary"" operates under the pretense of genuine ignorance but implies that the term is nonsensical or not officially recognized.
- **common knowledge:** euthanasia is a well-known term, suggesting the speaker is aware of it, thus hinting at sarcasm.
- **emotional words:** none specifically, but the overall tone is dismissive.
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement is using irony to suggest that the term is either incorrectly used or invented.
- **context:** the context centers around the recognition (or lack thereof) of the term ""euthanization"" in common language or the dictionary.",1,1

Cues:
- cultural background: the text discusses social attitudes toward being gay and the acceptance of lgbtq+ identities, hinting at cultural tensions regarding these issues.
- punctuation: the use of quotation marks around ""came out,"" ellipses, and the exclamation ""brava!"" indicates a tone that is not straightforwardly serious.

actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. this is illegal. you can't make it more illegal than it already is.   shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around. nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around. many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law.   as far as puncture wounds, do stabbings count?   or, as it appears, are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?

Cues:
- common knowledge: the statement references widely accepted societal issues such as shootings and illegal activities, playing on the notion that laws are already in place against such behaviors.
- language style: the text uses a dismissive and seemingly logical argumentative style to base an exaggerated truth, typical in sarcastic language.
- keywords: ""actually,"" ""illegal,"" ""criminals,"" ""stabbings,"" ""gun happy nuts.""
- emotional words: ""nobody has ever been injured,"" ""gun happy nuts running around,"" shows elements of sarcasm and exaggeration.
- rhetorical devices: rhetorical questions (""do stabbings count?"" ""are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?"") and hyperbole (""nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around"").

Input:
actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. where did you get such a thoughtless idea. and neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. however, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. they are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. and then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. and the offspring are perfectly fertile.

Cues:
1. special symbols: the text uses the word ""actually,"" which often primes a sarcastic statement.
2. cultural background: the text references the science of hybrid animals, indicating a discussion likely rooted in zoological knowledge.
3. language style: the dismissive tone evident in ""where did you get such a thoughtless idea"" suggests sarcasm.
4. keywords: ""actually,"" ""thoughtless idea,"" these terms reflect a condescending attitude.
5. surface emotion: the author seems to display indignation or disdain for the ignorance they attribute to the reader.

Well all you have to do is tell us the minimum time during which it could happen by NDS theory and then how long it actually took and we can compare the numbers. Of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers. Enjoy,1,"Input:
you have to be off for more than 4 days and after that i would get the princely sum of £79.15 per week..hardly worth having. unlike teachers i cannot stay at home and get paid when it snows too.

Cues:
- **punctuation**: the use of ""..hardly worth having"" and ellipsis suggests a trailing off in thought, emphasizing discontent.
- **emotional words**: ""princely sum"" is used sarcastically to imply that the amount is very low, despite the phrase suggesting otherwise.
- **context**: there is a comparison between the speaker's situation and that of teachers, with an implication of unfairness.
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""hardly worth having"" is understatement, and ""princely sum"" is ironic. there is also a hint of hyperbole in the portrayal of teachers' benefits.
- **common knowledge**: it is generally understood that teachers may have different job benefits, such as paid snow days, which can be contrasted with the speaker’s own situation.

Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this ""power,"" too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble ""stomaching"" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc. I love helping you reach new lows.

### Example:
input:
actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. this is illegal. you can't make it more illegal than it already is.   shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around. nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around. many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law.   as far as puncture wounds, do stabbings count?   or, as it appears, are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?

Cues:

- **punctuation:** the period after ""buddy"" and the capitalization and spacing for ""r*e*a*d"" both highlight sarcasm and condescension.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Extract the following cues: surface emotion, keywords, emotional contrasts, emotional words, special symbols from the Input text, to assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].'''
        
        ### Input:
        So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?   Wouldn't it just be easier, as well as more likely, for an emotionally disturbed student to just illegally bring a gun to school and kill their teacher, rather than waiting for a legal alternative to commit murder and go to prison anyway?

        ### Brief Response: 

        ### Label: 

        ","Input:
women's rights actually exist, unlike the christian god.

Cues:
1. **language style**: the language used is assertive and employs a definitive tone. words like ""actually"" can be interpreted as loading the statement with irony given the context.
2. **cultural background**: the sentence references two culturally and historically significant topics: women's rights and religious belief in the christian god.
3. **special symbols**: there are no special symbols present in the text.
4. **rhetorical devices**: the primary rhetorical device in use here is juxtaposition, contrasting an empirical social achievement (women's rights) with a matter of faith (existence of the christian god), to emphasize disbelief or irony.
5. **context**: the context appears to be a critique of the belief in the christian god, while asserting a progressive stance on women's rights.
