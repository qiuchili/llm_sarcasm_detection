### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""can u help?"", ""more conservatives needed on #tsu"", ""get paid 4 posting stuff like this!"", ""you $ can go to...""
- **sentimental indicators:** the request for help suggests a need or call for action.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""can u help?"" followed by an apparent promotional message might indicate a form of irony, especially combined with the notion of getting paid for posting. 
- **language style:** the capitalization of ""you $"" might suggest emphasis on the monetary aspect in a way that could be seen as mocking. 

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment appears to be a call for help, but the promotional and monetary context implies a possible disdain or skepticism towards the platform or the recruitment request. this disparity suggests a sarcastic undertone.

### Example:
Input:
guess its just me, brett and my mom this year. gotta love my family!

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony

### comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is humorous.
- true intention is to make a joke by playing with words and irony.

the use of humor and irony here suggests a sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the keywords ""exactly that sort of person"" and ""weirdo!"" can be seen as negative. the usage of ""weirdo!"" suggests a strong opinion, which could come off as either genuinely disapproving or as mockery.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the phrase ""exactly that sort of person"" is general and could be emphasizing a characteristic in a mocking way by exaggeration. the exclamation point after ""weirdo!"" adds a layer of emotional emphasis, potentially indicating a sarcastic tone. the overall structure implies that the speaker might not actually think the person is a literal weirdo but is using the term in a sarcastic or joking manner.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment appears negative with the word ""weirdo!"" but the context and method of expression (""exactly that sort of person"") suggest that the intention may be sarcasm, mocking the person in question.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentiment appears neutral and informational. the phrase ""most important thing i've learned in school"" suggests revelation or awareness, and the inclusion of a link implies that more information or an example will follow. there are no overtly emotional or exaggerated phrases.

### step 2: true intention
to assess sarcasm, we need to examine whether there is incongruity between the statement and the likely reality. considering the commonplace and traditionally serious context of learning things in school, the suggestion that the ""most important thing"" is shared via a link often implies it's likely something trivial or humorous rather than genuinely significant. this contrast is a common structure in sarcastic remarks.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of usual importance is juxtaposed with an implicit suggestion that the content behind the link may undermine that importance, creating a sarcastic tone. this approach aligns with common sarcastic usage, where an ostensibly serious statement reveals a humorous or trivial reality.

### Example:
Input:
guess its just me, brett and my mom this year. gotta love my family!

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **language style:** the sentence does not have overtly sarcastic language per se, but the use of ""oh boy..."" might hint at a veiled sarcasm when considered. the excitement could be exaggerated, hinting that the speaker might be less than thrilled about @masongoodman being in the house.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the accusation in the tweet seems to imply a contradiction or denial. by using ""liar"" and emphasizing ""never denied,"" the user might be pointing out hypocrisy or misinformation regarding the context of the conversation. the rhetorical style suggests an attempt to call out untruthfulness in a dramatic way.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.

### step-by-step analysis

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""merry christmas"" suggests a positive and festive sentiment.
- the use of hashtags like #sarcasm and #killusslowly indicates a negative sentiment.

#### step 2: true intention
- the presence of #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be sarcastic.
- the phrase ""exam na jud"" implies that exams are happening or imminent.
- combining ""exam"" with ""merry christmas"" suggests a juxtaposition, where the typically joyful holiday season is being unjoyously overshadowed by exams.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment is incongruous with the true intention. the phrase ""merry christmas"" is festive, but the context of exams and the use of #sarcasm indicate that the sentiment is not genuine.
- the hashtags leave little doubt that the speaker is actually feeling stressed or unhappy, despite the surface-level festive words.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

the keywords and phrases appear somewhat skeptical or ironic on the surface, such as ""the definition of #irony,"" ""a 77-year-old rapper went #viral,"" and ""maybe only way #babyboomers will buy in.""

### step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to imply that a 77-year-old rapper going viral and taking bitcoin mainstream is highly unlikely and suggests a humorous, facetious scenario that would be ironic. it suggests skepticism towards the likelihood of baby boomers adopting bitcoin through such means.

### step 3: compare and analyze
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes evident that the statement uses irony and an unlikely scenario to mock the idea of baby boomers adopting bitcoin only after a 77-year-old rapper goes viral.

Pretty excited about how you gave up on me. File Under: #sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

#### step 2: true intention
the speaker's true intention is to convey disappointment or frustration. the phrase ""pretty excited about how you gave up on me"" is clearly not meant literally, as people are typically not excited about being given up on. the use of ""pretty excited"" juxtaposed with the negative context suggests the speaker is not actually excited, but quite the opposite.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment marked by the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" aligns with the true intention derived from the contradictory nature of the words and situation described. both indicate sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

- surface sentiment: the sentence has a quizzical tone, posing a question that seems to inquire about the history of irony. 

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: the rhetorical questions and the mention of hipsters, combined with a somewhat mocking tone, suggest that the speaker is criticizing the hipsters for their misunderstanding or misuse of irony. the reference to history books in used bookstores in brooklyn adds a layer of irony, implying that hipsters should know better about the historical context of irony.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment appears to be a genuine rhetorical query, but the true intention, infused with rhetorical questions and a mocking undertone, indicates criticism. this discrepancy implies sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

the true intention here is to ridicule or mock the idea of having drama on social media as a means to appear ""badass."" the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator that the statement should not be taken at face value. instead, it presents the opposite of what was initially stated, using irony.

### step 3: compare and analyze
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we see that the initial positive sounding statement about looking like a ""badass"" through social media drama is actually being mocked. the phrase does not sincerely admire or promote drama on social media; rather, it sarcastically dismisses it.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""if it's open all night, pull an all-nighter"" seems to enforce a humorous exaggeration. there's an implication that staying up all night is an automatic response to something being available all night, which can be seen as an exaggerated and probably unadvisable action.
- **language style:** the use of the phrase ""i think the general rule is"" introduces an element of casual, possibly tongue-in-cheek commentary. this, combined with the impractical suggestion, indicates a sarcastic intention.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

"Being a hipster now is so mainstream. Oh, the irony. #hipster #irony",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

        ","### response:

step 1: **surface sentiment**: the tweet mentions ""we are fighting like animals,"" which could carry a negative sentiment, implying a difficult or aggressive situation. 

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase includes the clause ""exactly,"" which might suggest agreement. however, ""we are fighting like animals"" could imply exaggerated behavior, which might be intended sarcastically, suggesting that the situation is more chaotic than acceptable or expected.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**:
   - the surface sentiment of negativity and aggression fits well with a negative true intention.
   - the language used, particularly the exaggeration ""fighting like animals,"" can indicate sarcasm, as it overstates the situation, potentially to highlight the absurdity or intensity of the fight.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.

Stupid #doctors visits is gonna bury me!! Now that's #irony,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

### Example:
Input:
@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

the hashtags ""#considerate"" and ""#not"" indicate sarcasm, and the use of the 😒 (unamused) emoji reinforces a negative sentiment. the phrase ""reaaaal nice"" with elongated ""a"" suggests mock praise.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the statement is to express frustration and displeasure about someone going on vacation without the speaker. the mock praise ""reaaaal nice"" and the follow-up hashtag ""#not"" indicate that the speaker does not consider this action considerate at all.

### step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the positive surface sentiment often indicated by ""nice"" and the mocking tone of ""reaaaal nice"" followed by ""#not"" shows a clear intent to be sarcastic.

@ChainAttackJay No sugar during christmas time? :(,0,"
### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""no sugar during christmas time"" indicates a negative sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of the ""sad face"" emoticon :( suggests sadness or disappointment.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the rhetorical question ""no sugar during christmas time?"" implies disbelief or incredulity. christmas time is typically associated with indulgence and sweets.
- **language style:** the structure of the sentence and the usage of a sad emoticon indicate a contrast between expectation (having sugar during christmas) and the reality presented (no sugar).

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is negative due to the sad emoticon. the true intent likely expresses incredulity and criticism of the situation because it contrasts with the common practice of consuming sweets during christmas. this contrast and the use of rhetorical question heavily indicate sarcasm.

the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated.

the sentence superficially presents a contrast between a large number of victims from terror attacks and the perceived lack of sympathy from another group. the hashtag #irony suggests that there might be some kind of disparity or contradiction being pointed out.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be highlighting the perceived indifference or lack of sympathy from a specific group (referred to as ""paki"") towards the victims of terror attacks. the use of the hashtag #irony suggests that the speaker finds this situation hypocritical or contradictory.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
by comparing the surface sentiment (which is neutral or factual) with the inferred underlying sentiment (which implies frustration and a sense of hypocrisy), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. the statement points out a serious situation and finishes with #irony which is often used sarcastically to underline the perceived absurdity of the situation.

""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

        ### Response:

        ### Label:

been at the er now since 10... #yay #not

### step-by-step analysis:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: the hashtag ""yay"" typically indicates happiness or excitement. 

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: the context of being at the er for a long time generally suggests a negative experience. the hashtag ""#not"" directly contradicts the positive sentiment implied by ""#yay,"" indicating that the speaker is not actually happy or excited, but rather frustrated or upset.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment appears positive initially due to ""yay,"" but the true sentiment is negative and frustrated. the use of ""#not"" after ""#yay"" clearly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the phrase ""#not biased my ass"" and ""don't act like he was dirty for 10 years"" indicate a negative and potentially sarcastic sentiment. the inclusion of ""my ass"" typically conveys strong skepticism or contradiction.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style includes a rhetorical device in the form of a sarcastic remark, ""not biased my ass."" the writer is indicating that the claim of being unbiased is false. the phrasing ""don't act like he was dirty for 10 years"" further emphasizes disapproval or criticism, dismissing the original statement.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and true intention suggest that the user is using sarcasm to criticize or mock the original statement made by @lancemedow. the language and style are clear indicators of sarcasm, aimed at expressing disbelief or disapproval.

### Example:
Input: am really fuckin paying for it today #tequila #is  #the #one

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

1. **surface sentiment analysis:**
   - **keywords:** ""thank you studs for perfecting and teaching my bench,"" ""props on form from lifters in al""
   - **hashtags:** #dyel (do you even lift?)
   - **sentimental phrases:** expressions of gratitude and commendation (e.g., ""thank you,"" ""props on form"")
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:**
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""thank you studs,"" ""perfecting and teaching my bench,"" and “props on form” suggest a positive, grateful sentiment on the surface. the hashtag #dyel is a common phrase in the fitness community which can sometimes be used sarcastically. given the context, it could be interpreted as genuine if it’s praise from lifters in al.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - on the surface, the tweet expresses gratitude and acknowledgment of good form. the context provided (teaching bench press and receiving props on form) aligns with genuineness rather than mockery.
   - the hashtag #dyel can carry sarcastic undertones but considering the consistent positive sentiment in the rest of the tweet, it appears to reinforce the positive intention rather than contradict it.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

  - use of ""not"" in ""#not a school dropout"" serves as a direct contradiction to the earlier part of the text, suggesting that contrary to expectations, the subject is doing well.
  - implies that dropping out of school did not limit the person's success, which is typically unexpected.

### step 3: compare and analyze

- true intention implies highlighting the success of a school dropout, contradicting the negative connotation typically associated with dropping out of school.
- the use of contradiction for emphasis suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: the true intention of the sentence is to highlight the flawed logic in generalizing a whole group based on the actions of a few members, criticizing both the act itself and the implicit hypocrisy of the act. the use of '#irony' explicitly points out that the speaker perceives an ironic contradiction in such logic.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""i just love being ignored"" accompanied by the smiling emoji ""😊"" appears to express a positive sentiment. however, the hashtag ""#not"" with a frowning face ""😒"" directly contradicts this.

### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""i just love being ignored"" with ""#not"" and the negative emoji ""😒"" suggests the speaker does not actually love being ignored. the use of ""#not"" is a clear indication of sarcasm, as it reverses the apparent positive statement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment presents positive indicators like ""love"" and the smiling emoji ""😊"", but these are overturned by ""#not"" and the frowning face ""😒"", revealing the true intention is to express displeasure about being ignored.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

        ","let's analyze the input step by step to determine the correct label:

### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or straightforward. the sentence is primarily descriptive, ostensibly stating a task - ""produce mobile apps"" - followed by a link and a hashtag ""#not"".

### step 2: true intention
the hashtag ""#not"" is critical in understanding the true intention. in common usage, ""not"" after a statement traditionally indicates sarcasm, implying the opposite of the statement. this suggests that the person does not produce mobile apps, despite the straightforward assertion made earlier.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment: neutral/straightforward.
- true intention: the hashtag ""#not"" reveals that the true intention is to negate the statement and thus is sarcastic.

given this analysis, the true intention contradicts the surface sentiment, indicating sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""relevant""
- clues: the phrase ""about as relevant as"" is typically used to compare the importance or significance of something. here, the statement seems to downplay the relevance of michael sam and jason collins.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence uses a comparison to express a viewpoint. the writer seems to be suggesting that dale scott coming out as gay is not particularly relevant, much like michael sam and jason collins, who are also known for coming out publicly.
- this implies a dismissive or minimizing attitude toward the news.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: the statement on the surface appears dismissive rather than supportive.
- true intention: the use of comparison here, especially with a potentially dismissive tone about the importance or relevance of michael sam and jason collins, indicates sarcasm. the author likely does not genuinely believe the news is significant, and the comparison is used to make a sarcastic point.

- the inclusion of ""kids jeopardy"" is key here. for an adult or a person knowledgeable in general topics, getting a question correct on a children's version of a quiz show would be significantly easier and might not actually serve as a meaningful boost to their self-esteem.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""how many of those jobs earn #middleclass wages?""
- **hashtags:** #economics, #math, #z
- **sentimental phrases:** the question ""how many of those jobs earn #middleclass wages?"" implies a critical or skeptical view of job quality.
- **emojis:** none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of a rhetorical question here implies skepticism or criticism over the quality of jobs being discussed. it’s questioning the real-world impact or benefit of the mentioned jobs, suggesting they might not be as beneficial or lucrative as implied.
- **comparison:** given the context of the mentioned parties (economists, news shows, etc.) and the critical tone of the question, the true intention is likely to challenge the effectiveness or value of these jobs.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment points to skepticism or critique.
- the true intention also aligns with skepticism, possibly hinting at criticism.
- the question's form and the context strongly suggest a sarcastic undertone: the author does not expect a genuinely positive answer, thus highlighting the disparity between the presumed claim and the actual situation.

### Example:
Input:
@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

explanation:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the sentiment implied by the keywords, ""fancy"" and hashtags like ""#victoriasecret"" and ""#irony,"" suggests a mix of admiration and potential humor.

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention becomes clearer through the use of irony suggested by the hashtag ""#irony"". the statement implies an absurdity or contradiction (straight women fancying victoria's secret models more than straight men), which is not a conventional belief or expectation.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
comparing the initial admiration-like sentiment with the ironic twist, it becomes evident that the statement is not genuinely declarative. instead, it uses sarcasm to underscore a point about social perceptions.

therefore, the label is:

- the surface sentiment seems positive due to the phrase ""stunning work"" which is a compliment. the hashtags such as #british, #textiles, #footwear, and #madeinbritain indicate pride in the craftsmanship and origin. 

**step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.**

- the post promotes the use of female condoms and highlights the benefits of preventing std's/hiv/pregnancy. various hashtags suggest positive attributes such as #prevent, #latex #free. however, the inclusion of #not and #restrictive/tight introduces a contradictory sentiment that might imply a negative aspect or dissatisfaction.

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

        ","### step 1: assessing the surface sentiment

- **keywords/phrases:** ""if we win against poland and scotland,"" ""does that put us 65th in the world rankings,"" ""@youboysingreen @faireland,"" ""#sarcasm.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly suggests that the surface sentiment might not be genuine.

### step 2: deducing the true intention

- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the user is questioning the improvement in world rankings that is likely minimal or perceived as insignificant despite potential victories. the rhetorical question paired with ""#sarcasm"" indicates the user believes that the achievement (winning against poland and scotland) would still leave them at an unimpressive ranking, hinting at irony or mocking the situation.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention

- **surface vs. true meaning:** on the surface, it might seem like a straightforward inquiry about rankings, but the use of ""#sarcasm"" reveals that the true intention is ironic. the user is implying that even with those wins, the ranking won't be significantly impressive or meaningful.

""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

the surface sentiment of the tweet appears to be neutral or factual. it describes an event where protesters are chanting against a news network, and it highlights a sense of contradiction using the word ""despite"". there is also the use of the hashtag #irony, which suggests that there is something ironic about the situation.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be pointing out the irony of the situation. the use of the hashtag #irony indicates that the author finds it ironic that the protesters are chanting against fox news despite fox news agreeing with them on the issue of eric garner. the phrase ""despite fox agreeing with them"" further emphasizes this contradiction, hinting at a sarcastic undertone.

the surface sentiment is neutral/factual, merely describing the situation. however, upon closer analysis, the emphasis on irony and the apparent contradiction in the protesters' actions suggest a sarcastic undertone.

step 1: identify surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, indicated by the question ""why did nato need to expand?"" there are no overt sentimental phrases, emojis, or exaggerated expressions.

step 2: deduce true intention:
the question seems to imply skepticism about nato's need to expand after 1989, a period marked by the end of the cold war. the rhetorical nature of the question can suggest a critical view challenging the expansion's rationale. this can be interpreted as sarcasm, particularly given the often contentious debate around nato's expansion.

the surface sentiment of being inquisitive appears to mask a deeper critical or skeptical view regarding nato's expansion, typical of sarcastic commentary. the discrepancy between the simple question form and the implied criticism suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence mentions ""the #irony of playing this song on my way to #work"" and includes hashtags like #nomoney and #parttimecooks. the term ""irony"" itself often suggests a situation where the outcome is contrary to what was expected, which can be a clue for sarcasm. additionally, the hashtags #nomoney and #parttimecooks suggest a financial struggle or less-than-ideal situation.

### step 2: true intention
the use of ""#irony"" indicates that the speaker is pointing out a contradiction. mentioning ""playing this song on my way to #work"" in combination with #nomoney and #parttimecooks implies that the speaker finds it ironic (and possibly frustrating) to be heading to a low-paying or unsatisfactory job while listening to a specific song. this use of irony suggests that the speaker is highlighting a less-than-ideal reality with a tone of sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the true intention both point to an ironic and sarcastic tone. the speaker is highlighting a situation where their reality (going to work with no money) is in stark contrast to the implications of the song they are listening to.

1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.

### Example:
Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentiment appears to be one of frustration and disappointment. key phrases include ""forgot to move the elf on shelf"" and ""10 is asking me if christmas is real."" the crying face emoji 😥 reinforces a sense of regret and concern.

### step 2: true intention
upon examining the language style, there is an implication towards an underlying frustration due to the forgetfulness shown by ""mb"" and its impact on a child's belief in christmas. the mention of a popular cultural activity (""elf on the shelf"") along with the concern over the child's belief adds a layer of ironic humor and frustration. 

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the true intention show elements of ironic humor in a parenting context. the combination of disappointment in mb's action, mixed with the sensitive impact on a child's belief, hints at indirect sarcasm. the sentiment is conveyed sincerely, but with an underlying touch of ironic frustration about the situation's absurdity.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative and frustrated. keywords and phrases such as ""#not #working"" and ""when are we able to download games we paid in good faith?"" suggest dissatisfaction. the use of ""good faith"" implies that the user feels let down.

### step 2:
the user seems to be using sarcasm to criticize playstation's and sony's service. the rhetorical question ""when are we able to download games we paid in good faith?"" and the hashtag ""#psn start working again?"" indicate that the user is expecting a service that is not being delivered as promised, which is a common hallmark of sarcasm when expressing disappointment or frustration.

the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention of sarcasm. the sarcastic undertone is clear through the use of rhetorical questions and the phrase ""paid in good faith,"" which implies that the expectation of reliability has been unmet.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

the sentence describes an individual’s effort and resulting tiredness (e.g., ""i just wrote a 13 page paper... i was awfully tired"") and current inability to sleep. the hashtag ""#irony"" also indicates a non-literal meaning. 

### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to contrast the effort and exhaustion involved in writing a lengthy paper with the inability to sleep afterwards, which is an ironic situation. the hashtag ""#irony"" specifically points out that the writer finds the situation paradoxical and possibly frustrating.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment suggests a straightforward description of an exhausting task. however, the true intention reveals an ironic statement. the label ""sarcastic"" applies here because the hashtag ""#irony"" indicates a use of irony, making the overall expression sarcastic.

- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the style seems conversational. the repeated ""or"" could imply a casual discussion or a humorous indecision about choosing between these types of fish. the context might imply a continuation of a conversation about fishing, nature, or a similar topic. without more context, it's challenging to determine if this is sarcastic. however, the fact that it is addressing multiple users could hint that it’s part of a playful or humorous exchange.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is neutral and the conversational style doesn't clearly indicate sarcasm. however, the lack of context about the full conversation makes it hard to be certain. given the playful nature that mention of multiple types of fish in a social media conversation might imply, there’s a slight possibility of sarcasm, but not enough to be confidently detected as such.

### step-by-step analysis:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""one of my favorite things to do is to make people wonder"", ""completely unintentional"", ""buying bogs mud boots in a dress""
   - **sentimental phrases:** the phrases suggest an amusement or light-hearted sentiment regarding the act of causing curiosity.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""completely unintentional"" combined with the unusual scenario of buying mud boots in a dress suggests irony. the speaker likely did not mean to cause wonder, but the situation inevitably did. the humor in this contradiction suggests sarcasm.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment shows light-hearted amusement, while the true intention shows an intended irony in the situation described. the statement ""completely unintentional"" juxtaposed with the highly noticeable act of buying mud boots while wearing a dress indicates a sarcastic undertone.

- **language style:** the language is positive and sincere in tone, focusing on enjoyment and approval without any hint of negativity or contradiction.
        
### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is positive, and there are no indications that the true intent is contradictory. the statement appears to be genuinely expressing pleasure in watching sanjay start against butler.

There's no better way to start the week than to get your wisdom teeth taken out at 8 am!!! #not ☺😊?1,1,"
### Example:
Input: 
those were some great last minute substitutions @tomcrean

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: the sentence initially appears to be positive, suggesting that starting the week with a wisdom teeth extraction is a good thing. this phrase is followed by exclamatory marks and emojis like ☺😊, which usually indicate happiness.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: the use of the phrase ""no better way"" combined with an unpleasant activity like having wisdom teeth taken out suggests an ironic tone. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly negates the positive sentiment, indicating that the speaker actually thinks it is a terrible way to start the week. the use of exclamatory marks and positive emojis further supports the irony.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the inclusion of ""#not"" and the context of the described activity reveal that the true intention is negative. the discrepancy between the positive surface sentiment and the negative true intention indicates that the statement is sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
""oh look at me! i'm making people happy! i'm a magical man from happy land! who lives in a gumdrop house on lolly pop lane!""

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""i literally do not care at all"" contradicts the usual purpose of sharing something new and exciting on social media.
- the use of many hashtags may suggest mock enthusiasm or exaggeration.
- the rhetoric and language style (contradiction between the act of sharing and claiming not to care) indicates possible sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrases ""it wasn't for one person"" and ""it was a business expense"" could imply an attempt to clarify or justify an action or expenditure.
- **language style:** the structure suggests a defensive tone, potentially indicating that the speaker is addressing a misconception or criticism. the context of defending an action against a potential accusation might imply a sarcastic undertone.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- keywords: ""justice delayed is justice denied"" is a well-known phrase that emphasizes the importance of timely justice.
- use of the hashtag #irony suggests there is an element of contradiction or sarcasm involved.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""justice delayed is justice denied"" is being used in the context of a movie foreword by subroto roy sahara.
- considering that subroto roy sahara has faced legal issues, the use of ""justice delayed is justice denied"" in this context is contradictory and highlights the irony.

the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", which is a clear indicator that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker is discussing their losses following bye weeks and an fcs team and rhetorically asks if they should get rid of those weeks to avoid losses. the question is not serious but rather implies that the bye weeks and games against weaker teams (fcs team) are being absurdly blamed for their losses.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the true intention both indicate sarcasm. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" and the rhetorical question support that the statement is meant to be sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention

- there are no indications of rhetorical devices or sarcastic tones. the use of ""@iisuperwomanii"" and the playful nature of the question support this being a genuine, lighthearted inquiry.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: playful and genuine.
- true intention: asks a whimsical question without any underlying criticism or sarcasm.
- the tone and style of the message align with a straightforward, fun engagement rather than sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

@profootballtalk untrue - its cutler's fault

### steps:

step 1: surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment is dismissive and critical. the user asserts ""untrue,"" indicating a denial of a claim, and follows it with ""it's cutler's fault,"" which is accusatory and blaming.

step 2: true intention:
the true intention could be to mock or sarcastically critique cutler. the statement ""untrue - its cutler's fault"" seems to imply that blaming cutler is a common or easy scapegoat, suggesting the user may not genuinely believe it's cutler's fault. this phrasing is often used sarcastically to denote skepticism or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analyze:
the surface sentiment of denial and blame aligns closely with a sarcastic style. the use of ""untrue"" followed by a seemingly quick attribution of fault is a common marker for sarcasm, indicating the user is likely mocking the idea that cutler is consistently at fault.

   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

the surface sentiment includes mixed messages. on one hand, it mentions a positive event: ""malala yousufzai receives #nobelpeaceprize,"" implying recognition and celebration. on the other hand, it highlights a negative fact: ""#pakistan ranks in top 10 dangerous countries,"" which is alarming.

### step 2: true intention
the mention of ""#irony"" at the end strongly suggests a discrepancy between what is expected and what is reality. the true intention here seems to be highlighting the contradiction between malala yousufzai's recognition for peace and pakistan's dangerous ranking, pointing out the paradox or irony in the situation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear contrast between the award for peace and the dangerous standing of the country. the use of ""#irony"" amplifies this contrast, suggesting that the intention is to mock or criticize the situation rather than simply stating facts. this indicates a sarcastic undertone.

the surface sentiment appears to describe an item up for sale, specifically a ""not so ugly christmas sweater."" the use of the hashtag ""#not so ugly"" coupled with the mention of ""christmas sweater red with red snowflakes & sequins cardigan 1x xl"" provides a description of the product, presenting it as somewhat attractive or at least attempting to highlight any redeeming qualities.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""not so ugly"" in reference to a traditionally ""ugly christmas sweater"" utilizes a form of irony or mild sarcasm. the traditional context of ""ugly christmas sweaters"" implies that the item is humorously unattractive. by stating ""not so ugly,"" the intention seems to be sarcastic, implying the item is still somewhat unattractive but in a less extreme way.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment involves the description of an item, but the specific use of ""not so ugly"" to describe a christmas sweater, traditionally known for being funny due to its unattractiveness, suggests a sarcastic tone. the phrase leverages irony to make a humorous statement about the aesthetics of the sweater.

listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

Pulling my books out to prepare to organize my new bookshelves caused me to forget to bring my book today. #irony,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

pulling my books out to prepare to organize my new bookshelves caused me to forget to bring my book today. #irony

### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to describe a functional activity (organizing books) and an unfortunate consequence (forgetting a book). the hashtag ""#irony"" also suggests some form of unexpected twist.

### step 2: true intention
by examining the sentence closely, it becomes clear that there is an incongruity between the intended activity (organizing bookshelves) and the outcome (forgetting the book). the hashtag ""#irony"" reinforces that the speaker finds humor or frustration in this unexpected outcome, likely implying a sarcastic undertone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment indicates a mix of mundane task and a small mishap, whereas the true intention, supported by the use of ""irony,"" points towards sarcasm. the humor derived from the unexpected twist validates the sarcastic label.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""girls just wanna have fun"", along with multiple hashtags such as #work, #friends, #dance, and #drinks.
- **sentimental indicators:** the phrase ""girls just wanna have fun"" is typically positive and suggests a carefree, enjoyable vibe.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the inclusion of multiple hashtags, particularly #work and #not, which seem to juxtapose the carefree nature of ""girls just wanna have fun"", could imply an underlying sarcasm.
- **language style:** the use of the hashtags in such a manner may suggest that the author is not genuinely having fun but may be commenting on the expectation to have fun versus the reality of the situation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment seems to be positive and fun-loving. however, the true intent appears to be sarcastic due to the contradictory hashtags, especially #work and #not, suggesting a contrast between expectations (having fun) and reality (not having fun, possibly working instead).

   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes apparent upon considering the language style. phrases like ""even though @pga_johndaly's got more ex-wives than @pgatour majors"" and ""washed-up mess"" indicate a critical tone. the hashtag #not!! negates any positive sentiment that might have been misconstrued, showing clear sarcasm.

step 2: true intention: upon examining the language, there is no indication of irony, exaggeration, or incongruity that would suggest sarcasm. the statement is straightforward in expressing a clear opinion about the correlation between financial decisions and the cubs' performance struggles.

step 3: comparison and analysis: both the surface sentiment and true intention align in their critical viewpoint without any rhetorical devices implying sarcasm. the criticism appears genuine and earnest.

take me tooooo church #not

### response:

step 1: surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to express a desire or excitement to go to church, as indicated by the elongated emphasis in ""tooooo"". however, the hashtag ""#not"" directly contradicts this sentiment, suggesting an underlying different meaning.

step 2: true intention: the use of ""#not"" clearly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is actually expressing that they do not want to go to church, despite the initial appearance of enthusiasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment and the true intention are incongruent. the phrase ""take me tooooo church"" implies eagerness, but the hashtag ""#not"" completely negates this, revealing sarcasm.

        ","### steps:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the initial mention of a 'republican move' and 'effectively rob the royals' presents a tone of political commentary. the context around kate spending 32k on one meal has a shock value, suggesting extravagance and highlighting a misuse of resources. the use of the hashtag #irony further amplifies the sentiment.

2. **true intention:**
   - the use of irony, highlighted by the hashtag #irony, suggests that the statement is not to be taken literally. the exaggerated tone and the focus on the disparity between the royals' spending and the notion of robbery imply a criticism of excessive spending and possibly a critique of political decisions or social inequities.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment (commenting on extravagance and political action) contrasts with the true intention of mocking or criticizing the situation. the mention of irony directly indicates that the sentiment is not straightforward and is, in fact, sarcastic.

Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

### step 2:
deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

the sentence superficially appears to have a negative sentiment. the phrases ""i think it's your white skin"" and ""racist dna"" suggest a critical or accusatory tone. the hashtag ""#not"" also hints at potential sarcasm.

#### step 2: true intention
the speaker is likely being sarcastic. the mention of ""racist dna"" and ""he's a geneticist too, did ya know?"" in combination with ""#not"" indicates that the speaker does not actually believe the subject is a geneticist or that such dna exists. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly contradicts the preceding statements, reinforcing the sarcasm.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is negative or accusatory, but the rhetorical devices and language style (hyperbole, the use of ""#not"") reveal a sarcastic tone. the speaker is making a point by using exaggerated and obviously false statements to criticize the subject indirectly.

        ","### input:
#hi #good #morning #instadaily #snapchat #selfie #comment # #sleep #do #not #wake #up @ happy http://t.co/pts2omnyy6

### steps:

1. **surface sentiment**: the tweet contains multiple hashtags that are generally positive or neutral in nature such as ""#hi #good #morning #instadaily #snapchat #selfie #comment"". however, the hashtags ""#sleep #do #not #wake #up"" introduce a sense of irony or contradiction when combined with the positive tone of the other hashtags.

2. **true intention**: the juxtaposition of positive morning greetings with hashtags about sleeping and not waking up can be interpreted as sardonic. it suggests a conflict between what is being said (good morning) and what is actually intended (wanting to sleep and not wake up).

3. **comparison and analysis**:
   - the surface sentiment seems mixed because of the combination of positive and contradictory hashtags.
   - the true intention leans towards sarcasm due to the ironic combination.
   - the presence of sarcasm markers like juxtapositions and contradictions suggests that the tweet may not be genuinely positive.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

""i like listening to dads truck drivers tell me about them going to the strip joint and their old lady getting mad at them over it :face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the content of the sentence involves truck drivers talking about visiting strip joints and their wives getting angry, which is typically not something people genuinely enjoy hearing about.
- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

- the statement ""so there used to be a crossfit place here...."" suggests a neutral or slightly negative sentiment, as it implies the crossfit place no longer exists.
- emojis or hashtags also give clues. in this case, the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#pizzawins"" possibly indicate a humorous contrast.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention appears to involve a humorous or ironic commentary on the idea that a place promoting fitness (crossfit) has been replaced by something less healthy (implied by ""pizzawins"").
- the use of ""#irony"" directly indicates that the author is pointing out something ironic, and ""#pizzawins"" suggests a playful tone.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention both point towards a joking or ironic statement.
- the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly marks this as an ironic or sarcastic comment about the replacement of a crossfit place with something likely related to pizza.

- keywords: ""singing songs,"" ""once more with feeling,"" ""at work,"" ""#buffymusical,"" ""#stuckinmyhead""
- sentimental phrases: ""#"" hashtags can hint at an amused or casual tone but do not strongly indicate deep sentiment.

- the language suggests a form of mild self-deprecation or humor about having a song from a tv musical stuck in one's head while working.
- the hashtags indicate familiarity and a touch of humor, particularly used to engage with others familiar with the same cultural reference.
- this can imply a tone that could be meant to amuse or entertain an audience familiar with the context.

- the surface sentiment is neutral with a slight amusement.
- the true intention is to share a humorous or slight frustration about an earworm, with an implied connection to others who might find the situation relatable and funny.

step 1: surface sentiment: the sentiment appears defensive. key phrases include ""just because i am concerned for my country, and it's people"" and ""does #not make me a racist,"" which suggest the speaker feels the need to clarify or defend their stance against an implied accusation.
   
step 2: true intention: the language used, particularly the emphasis on ""#not,"" suggests that the speaker is asserting their genuine concern while rejecting the label of racism. however, there is an underlying tone that may hint at a common justification used in debates around nationalism and racism. no explicit irony, exaggeration, or incongruity is evident in the straightforward denial of racism.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment and true intention both focus on defending the speaker's concern for the country without showing signs of irony or sarcasm. the statement reads as a genuine attempt to clarify a position.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears playful and light-hearted. key phrases such as ""aha"" and ""so so cray tipsy"" suggest a humorous tone.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase 'so so cray tipsy' is an exaggeration. the term ""white girl drinks"" is a slang that often refers to stereotypically flavorful and sweet alcoholic beverages that are not typically considered very strong. the use of ""cray tipsy"" alongside these drinks indicates that the speaker is likely not being serious.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
both the surface sentiment and true intention recognize a humorous and exaggerated tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the statement purposefully exaggerates the effect of ""white girl drinks"" to convey the opposite of what is literally being said.

work Wednesday-Sunday .. #yay #not #moneytho 😩😭💰😒,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the sentence mentions ""work wednesday-sunday"", which generally implies a long workweek. the hashtags and emojis used are as follows:
- hashtags: #yay, #not, #moneytho
- emojis: 😩😭💰😒

- ""yay"" typically suggests excitement or joy.
- ""not"" negates the previous sentiment.
- ""moneytho"" acknowledges the payment as a positive aspect.
- emojis 😩 and 😭 express distress or frustration.
- emoji 💰 represents money (a positive aspect).
- emoji 😒 indicates annoyance or displeasure.

### step 2: true intention
the use of ""yay"" followed by ""not"" and the negative emojis 😩😭😒 suggest sarcasm. the person is not genuinely happy about working wednesday-sunday, but they acknowledge the money as a positive point (#moneytho, 💰). the combination of negative expressions and acknowledging money indicates a reluctant acceptance rather than genuine excitement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface indicators are conflicting yet revealing. initially, ""yay"" suggests positivity, but the immediate negation with ""not"" and accompanying negative emojis signify that the initial sentiment is sarcastic. the acknowledgment of money shows a silver lining but does not change the overall negative sentiment towards the work schedule.

   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

### step 2: true intention
the tweet seems to criticize someone's behavior, emphasizing that it is ironic or hypocritical. the term ""subtweets me"" refers to indirect mentioning or criticism on social media, adding to the passive-aggressive tone. the hashtag ""#irony"" suggests that the speaker finds it ironic that someone who calls them rude would then behave rudely themselves.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is direct in expressing frustration and anger, while the true intention appears to highlight the hypocrisy in the other person's behavior. the explicit calling out and the use of irony here are straightforward, with no hidden or opposite meaning implied.

- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.

### Example:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""you want to see something irish!!"", ""of all the reasons to be closed 😂😂😂""
- sentimental phrases: ""😂😂😂"" (laughing emojis)

the surface sentiment appears positive or amusing. the laughing emojis indicate amusement or entertainment.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony, sarcasm
- language style: conversational, slightly mocking tone

the phrase ""you want to see something irish!! of all the reasons to be closed"" and the hashtag ""#irony"" imply that the speaker finds the reason for closure surprising, absurd, and likely frustrating. the use of ""😂😂😂"" could suggest they find humor in the absurdity of the situation, but given the hashtag ""#irony"", it likely carries a sarcastic undertone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive or amusing.
- true intention is likely frustration or disbelief at the reason for closure, expressed through sarcasm.

the contrast between the surface sentiment (amusement, indicated by laughing emojis) and the true intention (frustration or disbelief) suggests sarcasm.

@panndder @mylittlebloggie @bloisolson how dare you accuse me of being a boomer.

Steps:
step 1: identify surface sentiment:

the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic, marked by the phrases ""my sister should be home,"" ""it's payday,"" and ""this is a good friday.""

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the capitalization of ""this is a good friday"" could indicate exaggeration. this overstatement, combined with normal events like ""my sister coming home"" and ""payday,"" suggests the person might not actually view these events as overly significant.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment is outwardly positive, but the exaggerated enthusiasm indicated by capitalization in conjunction with fairly mundane events suggests that the true intention might be to mock the supposed excitement.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- hashtag: ""#not"" directly contradicts the sentiment implied by the preceding words.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the use of ""#not"" indicates that the initial statement is not genuine and is intended sarcastically.
- language style: the word ""yay"" is typically used to express joy, but its pairing with the inconvenient time of ""3am"" and the hashtag ""#not"" suggests that the speaker is actually expressing displeasure.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment seems positive with the word ""yay"".
- the use of the hashtag ""#not"" clearly negates the initial sentiment, revealing that the true intention is to express annoyance or frustration.

- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

        ","step 1: **surface sentiment**:
   - the tweet could be interpreted as positive with a compliment expressing love for a ""chilled night in"" and appreciation marked by the phrase ""thank you hun x.""
   - the presence of the laughing emoji (😂) adds a jovial tone.

step 2: **true intention**:
   - the phrase ""saves having a hangover"" implies that going out and getting drunk, which would typically cause a hangover, is being contrasted with staying in.
   - however, the juxtaposition of ""chilled night"" with avoiding a hangover and the added laughing emoji might indicate a sarcastic undertone, as if implying that their previous nights (potentially with a hangover) were not in fact fun or appreciated.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**:
   - on the surface, it seems positive and appreciative.
   - the underlying intention appears to suggest a cynical view of past outings, possibly implying they don't actually enjoy nights in as much as they say, making the gratitude seem ironic.

@SurianibteAbu if it got the attention of the smartass to comment that.. Didnt it work anyway?? #irony,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.

- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.

### step 2: true intention
- the statement conveys that the author is scheduled for wisdom teeth removal, an event typically associated with pain and discomfort.
- the emojis reinforce the negative sentiment.
- the phrase ""the fact that this time next week i'll be getting my wisdom teeth out"" suggests dread about the upcoming event.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: negative sentiment indicated by ""😖🙊"" and the unpleasant event of getting wisdom teeth removed.
- true intention: the author is genuinely expressing dread about a future event and using emojis to emphasize the anticipated discomfort.
- there is no indication of any rhetorical devices like sarcasm; the expression is straightforward and genuine.

@Wallace17_daKid Way to lay out yesterday and put it all on the line #GoodLeader #Sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses keywords like ""lay out yesterday"" and ""put it all on the line,"" which seem to express effort and dedication. additionally, the hashtag ""#goodleader"" implies a positive sentiment, suggesting appreciation. however, the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates an intended sarcastic tone.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clear with the inclusion of the ""#sarcasm"" hashtag. despite the surface sentiment that might initially appear as praise or approval, the hashtag reveals that the speaker is being sarcastic and does not genuinely believe the person showed effort or leadership.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears to be positive based on phrases like ""put it all on the line"" and ""#goodleader."" however, the true intention is exposed as sarcastic due to the explicit ""#sarcasm"" hashtag. the contrasting indicators confirm that the statement is intended to mock or criticize rather than praise.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment: the sentiment appears critical and negative, focusing on the consequences of overpaying for sports talent and its effect on the cubs' performance. key phrases include ""overpay for that talent"" and ""perpetuates the losing cycle,"" which suggest disapproval and frustration.

step 2: true intention: upon examining the language, there is no indication of irony, exaggeration, or incongruity that would suggest sarcasm. the statement is straightforward in expressing a clear opinion about the correlation between financial decisions and the cubs' performance struggles.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentiment in the sentence appears to be emotional. key phrases like ""gingerbread house making still makes me cry"" suggest a strong emotional reaction.

### step 2: true intention
examining the language, the phrase ""still makes me cry"" is not typically used literally in this context, especially in relation to ""gingerbread house making."" the description likely employs exaggeration and irony, suggesting that the experience of making gingerbread houses is so frustrating or difficult that it metaphorically makes the speaker want to cry, which is an incongruous reaction for a typically enjoyable activity.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, the initial emotional reaction aligns with a possibly exaggerated or ironic statement. the mismatch between the expected positive sentiment toward making gingerbread houses and the described emotional reaction suggests the use of sarcasm.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.

- the mention of two contrasting opinions: amar singh's ""a+ rating"" and arun shourie's ""more is said than done"" creates a contrast that underscores the likelihood of sarcasm.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""that's a twist"", ""algorithms to cause more congestion & increase pollution"", ""too bizarre to be true""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""that's a twist"" suggests a surprising or unexpected situation.
- the phrase ""algorithms to cause more congestion & increase pollution"" presents an ironic scenario where algorithms, generally intended to optimize and solve problems, are purportedly causing more issues.
- the hashtag ""too bizarre to be true"" and ""#not"" imply disbelief and irony.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the use of irony is strong here. the claim that algorithms, which are typically designed to improve efficiency, are instead causing more congestion and pollution suggests a contradiction.
- language style: the hashtag ""#not"" at the end reinforces the idea that the statement isn't to be taken at face value and is instead highlighting the absurdity of the situation.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears to be presenting an unexpected and seemingly negative consequence of algorithms.
- the true intention, revealed through the use of irony and hashtags, indicates that the speaker is mocking or criticizing the idea.
- therefore, the expressed sentiment is sarcastic given the disjunction between what is said and what is actually meant.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

- **sentimental indicators:** the term ""phat"" is often slang for ""excellent"" or ""attractive,"" and ""sexyass"" is explicitly a positive descriptor, albeit a bit crude. the term ""picnic"" generally has neutral to positive connotations. the repetition of ""picnic"" and the phrase ""porked tiffany"" need deeper inspection.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** there is a possibility of irony or exaggeration, especially given the informal and somewhat provocative language.
- **language style:** the hyperbolic nature of ""phatsexyass"" and ""porked tiffany"" may suggest an attempt at humor or sarcasm. the repetition of ""picnic"" could be mocking or emphasizing a point.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

the sentiment in the tweet includes a mix of apparent frustration and sarcasm, as indicated by the use of the phrases ""trust me"", ""it will be out of form"", and the combination of emojis ""😒🙈"" which typically express annoyance and disbelief. additionally, the hashtag ""#irony"" is a direct indicator of the presence of irony or sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the use of ""trust me"" followed by a remark about the champions league loving manchester city (""@championsleague do love @mcfc i see"") hints that the speaker does not genuinely believe this, but is instead sarcastically suggesting that the champions league unfairly favors or consistently features manchester city, despite implying they are ""out of form."" the hashtags and emojis further support the sarcastic tone.

the surface sentiment and true intention both point towards a sarcastic tone. the contradiction in expressing mock trust and observation of favoritism, supported by direct mentions of irony, lead to a clear interpretation of sarcasm.

- the use of ""#irony"", ""#tough"", and ""#life"" also need to be considered.

### step 2: true intention
- the content of the sentence mentions ""someone throw me in at the deep end"", which usually implies a difficult or challenging situation.
- the use of ""#irony"" suggests that the speaker is not being literal but is instead indicating something opposite to the surface sentiment.
- the hashtags ""#tough"" and ""#life"" also suggest resilience in dealing with challenging situations, which doesn't align with the enthusiastic ""i literally love.""

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is contrasted with the actual content (implying a challenging or undesirable situation) and the use of irony, indicating that the speaker is being sarcastic.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""agree with that"", ""we are not mind readers"", ""haha""
- **sentimental indicators**: the keywords ""haha"" and ""agree with that"" suggest a light-hearted or comical tone.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""we are not mind readers"" is emphasized with individual word hashtags, potentially highlighting a commonly known and obvious fact. the addition of ""haha"" indicates that the statement is intended to be humorous or sarcastic.
- **language style**: the use of ""haha"" suggests a mocking or joking tone. additionally, the fact that the statement ""you may think we are, but we are"" contradicts itself in a humorous way adds to the suspicion of sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent**: the surface sentiment appears humorous, but the combination of stating an obvious fact (i.e., ""we are not mind readers"") followed by ""haha"" suggests a sarcastic undertone. the true intent seems to playfully mock the idea that people can predict thoughts.

the tweet contains mixed signals:
- ""day ninth december to have a pint at the boars head"" suggests a positive activity or plan.
- ""😊"" is a positive emoticon, indicating happiness or contentment.
- “#not really still in bed” introduces contradiction and suggests an element of irony or falsehood.

### step 2: true intention
analyzing for rhetorical devices:
- the hashtag ""#not really"" and the statement ""still in bed"" directly contradict the initial statement about having a pint at the boars head on december ninth.
- this contradiction often indicates a sarcastic tone, where the speaker says one thing but clearly means the opposite.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment includes a positive activity and a happy emoji, but this is undercut by the hashtag ""#not really"" and the statement ""still in bed"".
- the true intention seems evident: the speaker is not really going to have a pint and is using sarcasm to convey that they are actually still in bed.

  - emojis: the use of 😂 (laughing face) and 🚓 (police car) suggest some level of amusement or mockery.
  - hashtags: #waste, #of #money, and the emphasis on ""does not take five individuals"" convey a tone of criticism or frustration.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** 
  - possible sarcasm: the statement mocks the perceived overuse of police resources by emphasizing ""takes 5 police officers!!"".
  - hashtags emphasize criticism, suggesting waste.
  - the sentences and exclamation marks hint at frustration or disbelief.
- **language style:** uses exaggeration (""takes 5 police officers!!"") and a mocking tone strengthened by laughing emoji (😂).

Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the phrase ""picked an excellent day to get my hair done"" followed by the displeased emoji and the sarcasm hashtag is an example of irony. it indicates that the day was not excellent, despite what is literally said.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** on the surface, there is a mix of what could be interpreted as positive (""excellent day"") and negative (displeased emoji and sarcasm hashtag). the true intention, clarified by the use of the hashtag #sarcasm and the emoji, is to indicate that the day was actually not a good one.

   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""

   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: neutral and promotional.
- **true intention**: aligns with the surface sentiment; the purpose is to promote a book by providing a coupon.
- **no contradiction or hidden meaning**: there is no element that suggests sarcasm or an underlying meaning contrary to the surface sentiment.

Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears positive, indicated by the phrase ""better than others,"" which implies a comparative positivity.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the phrase ""some days are just better than others.."" uses generalization and lacks specificity, which can often imply a contrast to reality. the use of ""just"" and the trailing ellipsis ("".."") suggest an underlying meaning. this stylistic choice frequently implies that the speaker is actually commenting on a current day that is not better, hinting at a sense of irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment of being positive does not align with the true intention of the sentence, which appears to be a sarcastic comment on the real state of the day being described.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

the keywords such as ""didn't realize"" coupled with hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#brands"" appear neutral but slightly confused or surprised on the surface.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention can be detected by looking at the use of the hashtag ""#irony."" the term “irony” indicates that the statement might convey the opposite of what it superficially communicates. in this case, the speaker might be pointing out the unlikeliness or surprise of boston coach operating in chicago despite its name, which suggests it would only operate in boston.

### step 3: compare and analyze
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, we can see that the surface-level surprise or confusion is actually meant to be humorous. the use of the word ""didn't realize"" combined with ""#irony"" shows that the initial statement is not to be taken at face value and is intended to be sarcastic about the geographic naming incongruence of the brand.

   - **hashtags:** #cubaembargo, #tcot

- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative or critical, especially given the ""wow"" at the start and the mention of someone who did the ""hands up, don't shoot"" pose being arrested. the phrase ""hands up, don't shoot"" is associated with protest movements, and a player who did this pose being arrested can convey a sense of irony or disappointment. 

### step 2:
the sentence seems to carry a critical or disapproving undertone about the arrest of an nfl player who made a symbolic gesture related to social justice. it might be pointing out a perceived injustice or hypocrisy, which can often be a vehicle for sarcasm. the use of ""wow"" can be interpreted as expressing sarcastic astonishment or disbelief, indicating that the author finds the situation unexpected in a negative way.

### step 3:
the surface sentiment and the true intention both imply a critical and possibly sarcastic tone. the word ""wow"" generally sets up a context ripe for sarcasm, further reinforced by the ironic situation of someone known for a protest gesture being arrested.

   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- rhetorical device: the word ""not"" in uppercase (#not) implies negation or sarcasm. it's likely reversing the expected sentiment. the reader might initially expect useful advice, but ""#not"" followed by an impractical suggestion (making guitar picks) reveals a sarcastic undertone.
- suggestion: making guitar picks out of a motherboard is impractical and indicates the statement is likely a joke rather than a serious suggestion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is neutral or misleadingly positive, as it starts off sounding like advice.
- the true intention, revealed by the use of ""not"" and the absurd suggestion of making guitar picks from a motherboard, is sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment: the sentiment appears critical and negative, focusing on the consequences of overpaying for sports talent and its effect on the cubs' performance. key phrases include ""overpay for that talent"" and ""perpetuates the losing cycle,"" which suggest disapproval and frustration.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment of the sentence ""joe cole just casually walking past..."" appears neutral and observational. there are no immediate negative or positive keywords or sentimental phrases.

### step 2: true intention
to deduce the true intention, we examine if there is any rhetorical device at play. the word ""casually"" could imply nonchalance, suggesting that there might be an understatement here. if joe cole is a significant individual in a particular context (such as a celebrity or athlete), remarking on his casual demeanor could be ironic or imply understatement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment (neutral and observational) with the potential true intention (understatement or irony), the statement may imply that joe cole's casual demeanor is surprising or contrasting with expectations.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to express frustration or annoyance with the buffering issue of the #orionlaunch feed. key phrases include ""very stressful"" and the use of an exclamation mark, which indicate a strong emotional reaction.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""am i the only one who finds it"" suggests a rhetorical question. this phrasing often implies that the speaker believes that others share their sentiment and that it is a common issue. the use of an exclamation mark further enhances the emotional tone, which can sometimes indicate sarcasm when combined with the rhetorical question.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment expresses genuine frustration, but the rhetorical question ""am i the only one who finds it very stressful"" can imply sarcasm, as the speaker is likely aware that they are not the only person stressed by the buffering issue. the exclamation mark adds to the heightened emotional tone, which aligns with a sarcastic remark.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: am really fuckin paying for it today #tequila #is  #the #one

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

### steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""never,"" ""seen,"" ""gym,"" ""so,"" ""packed""
   - **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""never seen the gym so packed"" could be interpreted as expressing surprise or amazement.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase may carry an ironic undertone, implying that the gym is usually empty and the current situation is unexpected or unusual. it likely contrasts the observed reality with the expected reality, hinting at possible dissatisfaction or sarcasm about the crowd.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment (surprise or amazement at the gym being packed) may actually be contrasting with the true intention (ironic comment about the gym usually being empty and suddenly crowded, likely during a popular time like new year's resolutions). this contrast suggests sarcasm, as it highlights an unexpected deviation from the norm in a mocking or critical manner.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the exaggerated use of hashtags and the invitation ""whos wants to be next?"" suggests an enthusiastic call to action for engagement.
- **language style:** the language is highly exaggerated with multiple engagement hashtags, which can sometimes indicate an ironic or sarcastic tone, especially in contexts where such behavior is seen as disingenuous or spammy.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment aims to be engaging and positive, but the over-the-top use of hashtags and the somewhat desperate tone (""whos wants to be next?"") could imply sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the keywords and phrases such as ""enjoy,"" ""throwing up,"" and hashtags like ""#not,"" ""#hatethis,"" ""#sick,"" and ""#wanna #go #to #school"" appear to reflect a negative surface sentiment, suggesting a dislike for the situation described.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention can be detected through the use of contradictory statements. saying ""i just enjoy throwing up"" and then immediately following with hashtags like ""#not"" and ""#hatethis"" clearly indicates that the enjoyment part is not genuine. the contradictory hashtag ""#not"" implies sarcasm. additionally, expressing a desire to go to school because of sickness, something generally undesirable for most people, further hints at sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive phrase ""i just enjoy throwing up"" is not genuine. instead, it uses sarcasm to convey the speaker's discomfort and disdain for the situation.

@GazzaDowns I actually think he needs to use the youngsters in this reincarnation #irony,1,"
### Example:
Input:
guess its just me, brett and my mom this year. gotta love my family!

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**

### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""what a golden morning"" suggests a positive sentiment, implying a beautiful or pleasant morning.
- the emoji ""😒"" typically indicates annoyance or frustration, which contrasts the statement.
- the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator reversing the initial positive sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention is revealed by the emoji and the hashtag, which both suggest the opposite of what the statement claims.
- the phrase ""what a golden morning"" is being negated by the emoji 😒 and the hashtag ""#not,"" indicating that the speaker does not actually think the morning is golden.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment is positive (golden morning), but the true intention is negative (morning is not good).
- this contrast indicates a sarcastic tone.

the surface sentiment is indicated by the following clues:

- sentimental phrases: ""i wanna leave my room""
- capitalization and strong language indicate frustration and anger.

### step 2: true intention
- the use of strong language and capitalization suggests exaggeration and an emotional outburst.
- the tone and expression appear aggressive and exasperated but could be interpreted as rhetorical to convey impatience.
- the context appears to be someone feeling frustrated and possibly directing anger towards themselves or someone else for not sleeping, hindering their ability to leave the room.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (step 1) shows frustration and anger.
- the true intention (step 2) aligns with the sentiment but also suggests exaggeration to emphasize frustration, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
- considering the context and language style, there's a high probability of sarcasm to express extreme frustration.

Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

- **sentimental indicators:** the negative terms used suggest a critical or disapproving sentiment.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of capitalization and hashtags seems to amplify sentiment. the statement could be employing irony or sarcasm, especially given the politicized context.
- **language style:** the exaggerated stylistic choices (e.g., capitalization, hashtags) and the strong accusatory language indicate an opinionated, likely sarcastic tone. the mentioning of ""racist to not support demand for minimum wage"" could also be interpreted as a criticism of a contradictory stance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment appears heavily negative and critical. the excessive emphasis with capitalization and hashtags, combined with politically charged terms, likely suggests an undercurrent of sarcasm. the inclusion of ""#sad"" at the end further implies a sarcastic undertone.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""nevermind that, but do pray tell"" tends to have a mildly dramatic, old-fashioned tone and can be used sarcastically to mock or trivialize the preceding topic. additionally, ""would scherzy still play grizabella?"" sounds inquisitive but can be mocking the improbability or absurdity of the situation.
- **language style:** the language style is slightly formal and theatrical with phrases like ""do pray tell,"" which could imply sarcasm, as it's not standard conversational language.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is inquisitive and mildly dramatic, while the true intention, suggested by the formal and exaggerated language, implies a sarcastic undertone to the question. the tweet likely mocks the idea of ""scherzy"" playing ""grizabella"" as being unrealistic or inconsequential.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.

- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
this statement initially appears to be providing a compliment, ""every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top."" however, the statement quickly introduces a contrasting negative sentiment with ""unless you're skinny,"" implying exclusion and potentially disapproval. the hashtags ""#shade,"" ""#sarcasm,"" and ""#themoreyouknow"" further suggest a mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
by examining the language and hashtags used, it becomes clear that the statement is not genuinely complimenting anyone. instead, it is using an exaggerated, conditional compliment to mock, implying that the speaker doesn’t actually believe anyone is ""perfect"" if they are skinny. the hashtags imply that the statement is made in jest and is meant to be taken sarcastically.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears to be partially positive but quickly shifts to a negative bias towards people who are skinny. the true intention, bolstered by the sarcastic hashtag, indicates that the statement is meant to mock or criticize under the guise of complimenting.

### Example:
Input:
@panndder @mylittlebloggie @bloisolson how dare you accuse me of being a boomer.

Steps:
step 1: identify surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment appears defensive and indignant, marked by the phrase ""how dare you accuse me,"" which typically expresses offense or affront. no sentimental phrases or emojis suggest a humorous or exaggerated tone.

step 2: deduce true intention:
the language style does not contain exaggerated praise, irony, or humor typically associated with sarcasm. the direct confrontation ""how dare you"" signals genuine indignation and a straightforward response to an accusation.

step 3: compare and analyze:
the surface sentiment of defensiveness aligns with the true intention of expressing genuine indignation. no discrepancy between the apparent emotion and the underlying purpose was identified.

the surface sentiment of the input text appears to be enthusiastic and humorous, marked by the use of multiple exclamation marks (""take a look at those calves!!!"") and positive emojis (""😎😎😂😂""). the hashtags also suggest a playful tone.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention could be sarcastic because the excessive emphasis on ""calves"" using exaggerated praise and playful hashtags (""#not #about #the #arms"") hints at a rhetorical device suggesting the opposite of the literal statement. the presence of playful and exaggerated emojis also supports this.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of enthusiasm and humor aligns with the underlying purpose of sarcasm. the exaggerated praise and playful tone suggest a sarcastic remark about the emphasis on calves rather than arms, often seen in humor or irony.

let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

#### step 1: surface sentiment:
- **keywords and sentimental phrases:** ""tongue in cheek"", ""does nothing but instigate breed specific hate"", ""stick to reporting on tuques.""
- **emotional tone:** the tweet contains a negative and critical tone towards cale cowan's article.
- **hashtags:** #yyj refers to victoria, bc, canada, indicating the location context.

#### step 2: true intention:
- **rhetorical devices:** ""tongue in cheek"" suggests an attempt at humor or irony. the phrase ""does nothing but instigate breed specific hate"" is a strong negative statement accusing the article of causing harm. ""stick to reporting on tuques"" is a sarcastic remark diminishing the value of the article, suggesting the author should stick to trivial matters.
- **language style:** the statement is laced with sarcasm, irony, and criticism. the language suggests that the speaker believes the article is not only misguided but also harmful, implying that the author's skills are not suited to serious reporting.

#### step 3: compare and analyze:
- **surface sentiment**: critical and negative sentiment towards the article.
- **true intention**: uses sarcasm and irony to dismiss the article and criticize the author's skills.
- **comparison**: the sarcasm is evident in the direct remarks (""stick to reporting on tuques"") and the insinuation that the article is ineffectual and harmful.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

        ","### step 1: assessing the surface sentiment
- **keywords/phrases:** ""you think my mom and i would get along better,"" ""she's a middle child too,"" ""#irony,"" ""#middlechildsyndrome.""
- **sentimental phrases and hashtags:** the phrase ""you think my mom and i would get along better"" suggests some expectation of harmony. the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#middlechildsyndrome"" introduce an ironic tone, suggesting that the expectation is not met in reality.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the use of ""irony"" as a hashtag explicitly signals the presence of irony. the statement sets up an expectation that because both the speaker and the mom are middle children, they should get along better. however, the hashtag ""#irony"" indicates that this is not the case, conveying an opposite reality.
- the juxtaposition of expectation (""would get along better"") with reality (implied lack of harmony) points strongly to irony.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment reflects a benign expectation of harmonious relationship due to shared traits. however, the use of ""#irony"" and the thematic context of ""middle child syndrome"" (often implying conflict or neglect) reveal a true intention of highlighting an unexpected discord.

- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**

- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is sharply contrasted by the actual content (which implies annoyance or discomfort), indicating sarcasm.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

### steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the keywords, especially hashtags like #irony, indicate a complex sentiment. without the hashtags, the statement might come across as straightforwardly documenting an event (""ward was mad because skye hide (hid) a secret from him"").

2. **true intention:**
   - the hashtag #irony is a strong clue indicating that there is an underlying meaning contrary to the surface description. the use of irony often suggests a sarcastic or critical undertone, implying that the situation described is not as simple or direct as it seems.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment appears neutral to slightly negative (due to ""mad""). however, the inclusion of #irony significantly alters the interpretation, suggesting that the situation is being viewed with a sense of irony or sarcasm. given this context, the statement likely carries a sarcastic tone, poking fun at the apparent simplicity of the situation described.

the surface sentiment appears to be factual but with a hint of exasperation or frustration. the use of words in all caps (""zero,"" ""zero,"" ""none,"" ""nada"") combined with the hashtags and repeated emphasis suggests a strong emotional undertone.

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention seems to be expressing frustration or disbelief. the exaggerated emphasis through repetition and all caps words typically indicates sarcasm, often used to mock or underscore the opposite of what is being said.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment includes strong emotional words and repeated emphasis.
- the true intention behind using exaggerated emphasis suggests sarcasm.
- the repeated use of all caps and hyperbolic punctuation usually denotes a sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:
""oh look at me! i'm making people happy! i'm a magical man from happy land! who lives in a gumdrop house on lolly pop lane!""

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

- the post expresses frustration and disappointment as seen by phrases such as ""unfortunately taken already"" and ""a year ago."" the use of an ellipsis also adds to the sense of regret and lingering discontent.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the phrase ""the only company i thought would be best for the thesis"" emphasizes the user's belief in the suitability of the company for their thesis. following that with ""is unfortunately taken already... a year ago"" conveys a sense of missed opportunity and perhaps disbelief that the desired option was unavailable for so long without their knowledge. the language style, with an emphasis on ""unfortunately"" and the use of ellipsis, adds to the sense of irony and regret.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- while the surface sentiment leans towards genuine disappointment, the exaggerated emphasis on ""the only company"" and the irony of discovering it was taken ""a year ago"" hints at a possible sarcastic undertone. the frustration paired with this exaggeration and irony points towards sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

**explanation:**

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - **keywords and phrases:** the phrase ""#not enough"" has a negative connotation, indicating insufficiency or inadequacy.
  - **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""unfortunately"" adds to the negative sentiment.

- **step 2: deduction of true intent**
  - **rhetorical devices:** the combination of ""#not enough"" and ""unfortunately"" suggests a tone of disappointment. the inclusion of ""unfortunately"" can also imply sarcasm, depending on the context.
  - **language style:** the brief, pointed nature of the statement paired with the hashtag suggests a potential for sarcasm, as it might be highlighting inadequacy in a situation where the expected is opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is negative due to the indication of insufficiency. the true intent, when considering the rhetorical context, might be to mock or emphasize the inadequacy in a sarcastic manner.

given the usage of ""unfortunately"" and the context implied by the combination, the sentiment leans towards sarcasm.",1

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""probably my favourite book"", ""couldn't put it down"", ""5stars!""
- **sentimental phrases:** all the phrases present are positive and express high praise.
- **emojis:** none present.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of phrases like ""probably my favourite book"" and ""couldn't put it down"" followed by ""5stars!"" may indicate genuine enthusiasm and appreciation. however, the presence of an exaggeratedly positive phrase can sometimes be used sarcastically.
- there is a possibility that the statement might be sarcastic if the book is widely known or perceived as unenjoyable or boring.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment:** extremely positive and enthusiastic.
- **true intention:** the true sentiment is harder to discern without context. if the book being referred to is generally well-received, the enthusiasm is likely genuine. if the book is known for negative reviews or being difficult to read, the statement could be sarcastic.

given the current information and without additional context about the common perception of the book:

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""most strippers belong right where they are"" and hashtags like #nocollegeneeded, #adamsmith, #specialization, and #strippers.
- **sentimental indicators:** the tone appears to make a judgment about strippers, implying they are best suited for their current profession without the need for further education.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of phrases like ""belong right where they are"" along with hashtags such as #nocollegeneeded suggests a dismissive or derogatory attitude towards strippers, implying they are unfit for other professions.
- **language style:** the language leans towards a derisive or mocking tone, particularly with the implication that no further education is necessary for strippers. the mention of adam smith and specialization hints at an attempt to sound more intellectual or satirical.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** while the surface sentiment may seem factual or evaluative, the true intention appears to belittle strippers by aligning them with a negative stereotype. the hashtags and phrasing suggest a sarcastic tone, implying that strippers are limited in their capabilities or potential.

   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

the surface sentiment of the statement seems to be positive but with a hint of questioning. it appears to be an announcement about michael mann giving a lecture on professional ethics for climate scientists. however, the use of hashtags like ""#consensus,"" ""#absolute hilarious,"" and ""#irony"" are notable. the word ""hilarious"" generally indicates something funny or positive.

### step 2: true intention
the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#absolute hilarious"" suggest that the statement is not meant to be taken at face value. the fact that the speaker finds it ""hilarious"" and ""ironic"" that michael mann is lecturing on professional ethics implies that they believe there is some kind of contradiction or hypocrisy involved. michael mann is a well-known climate scientist who is sometimes a controversial figure in public discourse, which could be why the speaker finds it ironic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment seems positive but contains clear indicators of irony and sarcasm, especially given the context and the specific choice of hashtags like ""#irony"" and ""#absolute hilarious."" the true intention behind the statement is likely to mock or criticize the idea of michael mann lecturing on ethics, suggesting the speaker finds it contradictory or hypocritical.

the tweet mentions numerical values ($5, $1) and includes various hashtags related to betting or gambling (#lockitin, #lottoclub, #bankopen), which convey a sense of excitement or urgency. the phrase ""#not criminal"" seems to attempt to clarify that the actions being described are legal.

### step 2: true intention
the tweet seems to be promoting or talking about some kind of betting or money transaction, tagging certain locations (obx, gboro). the phrase ""#not criminal"" could potentially be sarcastic, suggesting that the actions being described might be legally or ethically questionable despite the claim.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.

- keywords: ""fun day"", ""study""
- sentimental phrases or markers: the use of hashtags ""#not"", ""#ew"", ""#saywhat"" signals a negative reaction to the idea of studying on a sunday.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the hashtags ""#not"", ""#ew"", ""#saywhat"" indicate a sarcastic tone as they negate the initial positive statement.
- language style: the initial phrase ""sunday is such a fun day to study"" is stated in a way that is clearly ironic due to the subsequent negating hashtags.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment seems positive initially with ""fun day"".
- true intention, revealed through the use of contradictory hashtags, indicates a sarcastic and disdainful tone.

Reunited with my pump this morning. #yay #not 😣,1,"
### Example:
Input: 
those were some great last minute substitutions @tomcrean

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

        ","### step 1:
the surface sentiment, as indicated by keywords such as ""reunited with my pump this morning,"" coupled with the hashtags ""#yay"" and ""#not"", along with the emoji 😣, appears to present a conflicting emotion. the hashtag ""#yay"" suggests a positive sentiment, while ""#not"" and the 😣 emoji suggest negativity.

### step 2:
the true intention can be deduced by examining the use of hashtags and the emoji. the phrase ""reunited with my pump this morning"" likely refers to something the speaker is not looking forward to. the hashtag ""#not"" and the distressed emoji 😣 immediately negate the initial seemingly positive hashtag ""#yay"", indicating that the speaker is actually unhappy about this reunion. this contrast is a rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm.

### step 3:
there is a clear discrepancy between the apparent initial positive sentiment (#yay) and the true negative sentiment (#not, 😣). this discrepancy is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ### Label: 

        ","## step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#irony"", which suggests that there is an element of irony involved. the mention of ""santa's gifts"" and the context of being almost 18 gives the appearance of a sincere hope or concern about what to ask for as gifts.

## step 2: true intention
the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" indicates that the speaker is not actually expecting or excited about receiving santa’s gifts but is rather pointing out the absurdity or humor in the situation. at nearly 18 years old, the expectation of receiving gifts typically associated with younger children is humorous and not meant to be taken seriously.

## step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears sincere at first, but the true intention is illuminated by the use of the hashtag ""#irony"". the speaker is making a sarcastic comment about the childish nature of still expecting santa's gifts at almost 18, which is ostensibly an age where one no longer believes in santa claus or expects such gifts.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentiment seems to be one of curiosity or skepticism, indicated by the phrase ""i wonder."" the percentage figure ""43%"" and the subject of private cloud imply a discussion around a technical or industry-specific topic.

### step 2: true intention
examining the sentence closely, ""i wonder"" combined with a specific percentage hints at a subtle doubt or skepticism about people's understanding of what a private cloud is. the phrase implies that the author might believe that not many people truly understand it, despite the given statistic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface curiosity or skepticism aligns with the underlying intention of casting doubt on the understanding of a private cloud by a significant portion of people. this skepticism, framed as a question, often leverages a rhetorical device typically reflective of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

- the phrase ""i want to stay here as long as possible"" on the surface could indicate a positive sentiment if taken literally, suggesting satisfaction or happiness with the current situation. the hashtag #thinking suggests contemplation or pondering, potentially indicating some depth to the statement.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the structure of the question ""if i were to ask"" followed by ""i want to stay here for as long as possible"" can suggest a hypothetical or conditional tone, which may imply that the speaker is not genuinely expressing a desire to stay. instead, it could be contextually indicating the opposite. the use of ellipsis at the end, along with the hashtag #thinking, might imply irony or an unspoken follow-up sentiment suggesting the opposite of what’s being said.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- while the surface sentiment might suggest positivity, the deeper analysis suggests a potential ironic or sarcastic undertone due to the hypothetical phrasing and contemplative hashtag. the true intention appears to indicate dissatisfaction or a contrast to the initial positive statement.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ### Response:

the sentence uses the hashtag ""#sarcasm,"" which directly indicates that the statement might be sarcastic. additionally, the context talks about ""cleveland coming again,"" which can be interpreted variably based on the history and performance of cleveland in the relevant context (likely sports).

### step 2: true intention
since the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is explicitly used, it strongly suggests that the statement preceding it (""just wait till cleveland comes again!"") is not intended to be taken literally. instead, it likely implies skepticism or disbelief about cleveland's ability to perform well.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (""#sarcasm"") provides a direct indication that the statement is sarcastic. the true intention, given the context and the usage of the hashtag, confirms that it should not be taken at face value and is meant to convey the opposite of the literal meaning.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

on the surface, the sentence combines factual information with an expression of gratitude. phrases like ""'liberated' iraq"" and ""thank you, western liberators"" initially appear to acknowledge the actions of western countries positively.

### step 2: true intention
the use of quotation marks around ""liberated"" indicates skepticism or criticism towards the claim that iraq was truly liberated. adding that 2014 was ""one of bloodiest years with more than 36,000 victims"" starkly contrasts with the notion of liberation, revealing the underlying criticism. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly confirms the ironic tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment may seem positive due to phrases like ""liberated"" and ""thank you,"" but the true intention, deeply rooted in stark contrast and highlighted by the hashtag ""#sarcasm,"" clearly illustrates that the statement is ironic and intended to criticize.

the surface sentiment appears to be critical or playful. phrases like ""tag a teammate who is so bad"" and ""i'm sorry to say it's @sam__clough"" are negative, implying criticism of @sam__clough's performance.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the use of phrases like ""who is so bad"" and ""i'm sorry to say"" alongside tagging a specific person indicates a playful banter common among teammates. the hyperbolic statement ""who is so bad, he runs the line every week"" is exaggerated for humorous effect.

- rhetorical devices: hyperbole (overstating how bad the teammate is), and a direct mention which hints at an inside joke or friendly teasing.
- language style: casual and humorous, typical for friendly jabs.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention align in showcasing playful teasing. the hyperbolic nature and the jocular context strongly suggest the presence of sarcasm.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**

Just loveeee driving upstate in the snow #not,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

the sentence superficially appears to express a positive sentiment. the use of the phrase ""just loveeee"" suggests strong affection or enjoyment.

### step 2: true intention
however, further examination reveals the hashtag ""#not"", which is a common rhetorical device used to indicate sarcasm. the exaggeration in ""loveeee"" additionally hints at an ironic tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the underlying true intention (negative, due to the use of ""#not""), the statement is clearly sarcastic. the speaker does not actually enjoy driving upstate in the snow.

### Example:
Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

Input:
""i like listening to dads truck drivers tell me about them going to the strip joint and their old lady getting mad at them over it :face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the content of the sentence involves truck drivers talking about visiting strip joints and their wives getting angry, which is typically not something people genuinely enjoy hearing about.
- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is sharply contrasted by the actual content (which implies annoyance or discomfort), indicating sarcasm.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

- **emojis:** none present, but the use of "">^<"" as an emoticon indicates a positive, cute reaction.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of ""aw"" and ""oppa"" seems genuine, with no clear indication of irony or sarcasm. the headline mentions henry asking fans to let him sleep, which could be taken at face value as a genuine request for privacy, and the ""aw"" suggests sympathy.

- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the phrase ""officially surrounded myself with the most amazing people"" combined with the smiling face emoji 😊 indicates a positive and happy sentiment. 

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style seems to be straightforward and positive. however, the usage of phrases like ""officially surrounded myself"" can sometimes imply a sense of exaggeration or irony depending on the context. the term ""the most amazing people"" is usually a sincere compliment, but it can also be used sarcastically in a certain tone.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment suggests positivity due to the keywords and emojis. in the absence of additional context, such as knowing the relationship with the ""amazing people"" and the sender's usual tone, it is challenging to ascertain if the intention is sarcastic or genuine. however, given that the statement contains a strong positive affirmation and an emoji that reinforces a positive feeling, the chances of it being non-sarcastic are higher.

Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""suck,"" ""identifying #irony""
- clues: the term ""suck"" indicates a negative sentiment toward republicans. the mention of ""identifying #irony"" could indicate irony or sarcasm. the reference to alanis morissette, known for her song ""ironic,"" could be a pop culture clue hinting at irony or sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the statement claims that ""republicans suck more at identifying #irony than alanis morissette."" since alanis morissette's song ""ironic"" famously includes situations that are often not truly ironic, the comparison suggests that republicans are very poor at identifying irony, potentially worse than someone infamously associated with misunderstanding irony.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: negative towards republicans, possibly sarcastic.
- true intention: to criticize republicans for their lack of understanding of irony, using a sarcastically exaggerated comparison to alanis morissette.

- language style: the use of ""doesn't fix anything!"" supports the idea that the initial statement was not meant to be taken at face value.

   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- **keywords:** ""name an excuse that people use not to workout""
- **hashtags:** #excuse, #not, #workout
- **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""excuse"" and ""not to workout"" suggests a negative or dismissive sentiment towards those who don’t work out.
- **emojis:** none present.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase is a question inviting answers that highlight excuses. the inclusion of ""not"" in uppercase implies a focus on invalid reasons for skipping workouts. the rhetorical question format suggests a dismissive or mocking tone towards people who avoid working out.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of the sentence already indicates a somewhat critical attitude towards excuses for not working out. the true intention, revealed through the mocking tone of the rhetorical question, aligns with the surface sentiment.
- the contrast between a straightforward question and the implied criticism through the rhetorical device uses sarcasm to emphasize the disapproval of excuses for not working out.

the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""christmas"" typically evokes positive sentiment, but the phrases ""foh"" (an abbreviation for ""f*** outta here""), ""just a day people!!"", and ""get a grip"" suggest a negative sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the tone is dismissive and exasperated.

### step 2: deduce true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the rhetorical device used here is likely sarcasm, where the speaker is downplaying the significance of christmas, which is generally considered an important and positive day for many.
- **language style:** the use of ""foh,"" ""get a grip,"" and ""chow some mopani worms"" suggests a very informal, dismissive, and possibly mocking tone. 

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment appears negative and dismissive about christmas. the true intent seems to exaggerate the speaker's perceived overreaction of others towards christmas in a sarcastic manner.

Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

- the message does not contain rhetorical devices aimed at criticizing or conveying a hidden meaning.
- the intention is straightforward marketing, leveraging humor including the concept of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: promotional and humorous
- true intention: to market a funny tank top with a reference to sarcasm
- the tone is not critical nor does it carry a hidden critical or contrasting message.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment of calmness and lack of nerves contrasts with the potential underlying irony. the phrasing ""aren't nervous"" in this context is likely intended to be sarcastic, suggesting the gophers actually have a reason to be nervous.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of frustration and humor. key phrases that suggest this include ""bitches be like"" followed by a series of hashtags that include ""#more #appointments #please #not#crazy#enough .... yet."" the use of ""bitches be like"" and the somewhat exaggerated tone of needing more appointments hint at some level of frustration or exasperation, but also playfully.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be expressing frustration with the number of orthodontist appointments in a humorous and exaggerated manner. the phrase ""bitches be like"" is often used to mimic or mock typical complaints or behaviors, suggesting this isn't a serious statement. the hashtags like ""#not#crazy#enough .... yet"" reinforce the exaggerated, humorous tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
both the surface sentiment and the true intention indicate an exaggerated, humorous expression of frustration. the exaggerated tone, use of hyperbole, and playful mocking language style all contribute to a sarcastic sentiment.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

step 1: **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""sickens me that killing innocent black men & children has become such a lucrative career in america.""
   - **hashtags:** #mikebrown, #trayvonmartin, #ericgarner
   - **sentimental phrases:** ""sickens me,"" ""killing innocent black men & children,"" ""lucrative career in america"" contain strong negative sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

step 2: **true intention deduction:**
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""killing innocent black men & children has become such a lucrative career in america"" uses hyperbole to criticize and draw attention to systemic issues. it is highly unlikely that the speaker means it literally; instead, it's a condemnation of racism and police brutality.
   
step 3: **comparison and analysis:**
   - **surface sentiment** appears to be negative, indicating disgust and outrage.
   - **true intention** is conveying criticism and condemnation of societal issues, specifically related to systemic racism and police violence against black americans.
   - there is a strong contrast between the literal meaning of the words (""lucrative career"") and the true intention, creating irony which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

        ","### surface sentiment:
- **keywords:** #not sure who will take it home?
- **hashtags:** none that provide additional sentiment context.

### true intention:
- the phrase ""not sure who will take it home?"" suggests uncertainty about the outcome.
- the use of the hashtag #not implies uncertainty but it can also imply skepticism or sarcasm when combined with the rest of the sentence.
- the sentence could be interpreted as genuine uncertainty or it could contain sarcasm, implying that the result is obvious or predetermined.

### comparison and analysis:
- **surface sentiment:** uncertainty.
- **true intention:** it’s ambiguous; could imply genuine uncertainty or sarcasm depending on the context and tone of the conversation.

considering the ambiguous nature of the sentiment and the hashtag that may imply sarcasm:

### Example:
Input:
@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

i actually just started crying while brushing my teeth due to lack of sleep, stress and test anxiety. today's gonna be a good one... #not

### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement ""today's gonna be a good one..."" appears positive on the surface. however, the context of ""crying while brushing my teeth due to lack of sleep, stress and test anxiety"" indicates a negative sentiment. the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly negates the positive appearance of the initial statement.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""today's gonna be a good one... #not"" uses sarcasm to express that the day is expected to be bad, contrary to its literal meaning. the context of crying, lack of sleep, stress, and test anxiety further supports that the day is not going to be good.

### step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment initially appears positive (""today's gonna be a good one...""), the true intention is negative. the use of ""#not"" explicitly indicates sarcasm, making it clear that the initial positive sentiment is not genuine.

Don't you just love those people who won't shut up in class then hold everyone back by asking the teacher to repeat answers? #sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input:
guess its just me, brett and my mom this year. gotta love my family!

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention behind the tweet is to mock or criticize the idea of needing more guns. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" and the exaggerated statement about santa bringing a gun underscore the speaker’s disbelief in the position they are pretending to support.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment uses sarcasm markers such as capitalization for emphasis and directly includes ""#sarcasm"". the true meaning is revealed by the exaggeration and the tag, clearly indicating the speaker is not sincere but using sarcasm to critique the pro-gun stance.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **sentimental phrases and hashtags:** ""great start to the week!"" on its own suggests a positive sentiment. however, the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" directly indicates sarcasm.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly points to the message being sarcastic. the phrase ""lacking inspiration"" indicates a feeling of frustration or deficiency. ""scribbling angry/pretty things"" implies a coping mechanism or outlet for frustration. the phrase ""great start to the week!"" is meant to be interpreted in the opposite way due to the context and the hashtag.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the initial positive-seeming statement (""great start to the week!"") is contradicted by the context provided by the phrase ""lacking inspiration"" and the hashtag ""#sarcasm."" therefore, the true intention is ironic and negative, highlighting dissatisfaction or frustration with the start of the week.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

#### step 1: identify surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears concerned and promotional, as seen in the proactive and encouraging phrases ""have you lost your zing?"" and ""check out my latest quickie."" the hashtags (#dreamagain, #habitually, #internetmarketnewbie) are positive, aimed at motivating someone to revive their passion or energy. the url indicates a promotional aspect.

#### step 2: deduce true intention
the phrases ""have you lost your zing?"" and ""working too hard?"" are rhetorical but don’t exhibit a typical sarcastic tone. instead, they seem to genuinely address the recipient's possible fatigue or stress and offer a solution. the overall tone appears sincere in its aim to promote something the speaker believes to be helpful.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
the apparent promotional intent in the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention of addressing a problem (loss of zest, overwork) and offering a solution. there is no indication of irony or sarcasm.

the surface sentiment can be inferred from the following clues:
- keywords: ""heartless,"" ""dumb nation,"" ""deserves to be taken for a ride again and again""
- hashtags: #sarcasm, #indiawithpakistan, #lakhvi
- the overall tone includes negative and derogatory language.

### step 2: true intention

- the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the message is sarcastic.
- the usage of negative terms and the hyperbolic phrase ""taken for a ride again and again"" suggest that the true intention is not genuine support but mockery and criticism of the idea suggested by the #indiawithpakistan hashtag.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the surface sentiment (step 1) includes negative and mocking language.
- the true intention (step 2) reveals that the message is sarcastic, as the hashtag #sarcasm directly signifies this, and the phraseology supports this interpretation.
- both surface sentiment and true intention are aligned towards sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""stop work under crew contracts,"" ""#irony""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the term ""#irony"" directly points to a sense of contradiction or unexpected situation.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the use of ""#irony"" suggests a discrepancy between what is expected and what is happening. typically, companies like boeing and spacex are expected to be working steadily on space projects, so being told to stop work is contrary to expectations and is thus ironic.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment seems straightforwardly ironic due to the hashtag. the true intention is to highlight the unexpected nature of the situation where two prominent aerospace companies are halted in their work, which is typically very important and high-profile.

the surface sentiment appears to be one of frustration or desperation, indicated by the phrase ""i need to get out of this car before i kill my dad."" the threat of ""killing my dad"" suggests a high level of irritation.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the phrase ""before i kill my dad"" is likely not meant to be taken literally. this exaggeration is often used humorously to express extreme annoyance or frustration, which can be a sign of sarcasm. the true intention appears to be a dramatic overstatement to convey how frustrated the speaker is.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment of frustration and desperation matches with the exaggerated, humorous style of expressing frustration in step 2. this dramatic overstatement aligns with common sarcastic expressions.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrasing uses irony; the speaker's attempt to like chris brown is consistently thwarted by chris brown's actions. this use of irony where expected positivity turns into repeated negativity suggests sarcasm.
- **language style:** the phrases ""royally eff that up"" and ""chronic loose cannon"" are strong negative descriptors. the language suggests exasperation and disillusionment.

the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence includes phrases that suggest a positive sentiment: ""look good feel good!"" and the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#teamnosleep"" which could be neutral or slightly negative depending on interpretation. the hashtag ""#cantopeneyes,"" however, clearly indicates exhaustion and a lack of sleep, which contradicts the initial positive sentiment of ""look good feel good!""

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the sentence is likely to highlight a contradiction between the expected outcome of looking good and feeling good versus the reality of being extremely tired (#teamnosleep, #cantopeneyes). the hashtag ""#not"" is a critical clue that negates the initial positive statement.

### step 3: compare and analysis
the surface sentiment appears positive (""look good feel good!"") but is immediately contradicted by the true intention revealed by the hashtags indicating tiredness and the negation implied by ""#not."" this contradiction suggests the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically, highlighting the disparity between looking good and actually feeling good when one is exhausted.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be a nostalgic longing for the past experiences of receiving presents under the christmas tree. however, the phrase ""i wanna move back in"" suggests an exaggeration for effect, likely indicating that the author does not genuinely wish to move back in but is rather humorously lamenting the loss of childhood.

the initial sentiment appears to be casual and playful. the word ""few"" is in quotes, suggesting an understatement. the emojis (♻♻) and the hashtag (#craftbeer) also add to the playful tone. there's no direct negative sentiment or outrage.

### step 2: deduce true intention
the use of quotes around ""few"" often indicates understatement or sarcasm, implying that the actual number of empties is higher than stated. the playful nature of the phrasing and the context (recycling beer bottles) indicates that the speaker is likely jesting about their consumption.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment is casual and playful, while the true intention reveals a likely sarcasm about the number of beer bottles. the discrepancy between stating a ""few"" and the implication of many aligns with common sarcastic expression.

the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- ""zoloft bag"": zoloft is an antidepressant, which may imply an association with stress or mental health.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the use of #irony and #psychhumor hashtags signals the sentence is meant to be humorous and ironic.
- the sentence likely uses irony by contrasting the stress of finals with the idea of the professor carrying the exams in something associated with mental health medication, creating a humorous effect.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **sentimental phrases:** no strong sentimental phrases, but the idea of ""an hour long conversation"" could carry a hint of exasperation or irony.
- **emojis:** none present

### step 2: true intention deduction:
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""make dua for me bro"" implies asking for thoughts or prayers, generally a brief or simple request. transitioning this into ""an hour long conversation"" suggests a mismatch between expectations and reality—likely intended as hyperbolic irony, hinting at unexpected or unwelcome elongation of what was anticipated to be brief.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment sees simple communication turning into an unexpectedly long conversation, which hints at some form of inconvenience or minor frustration.
- the true intention behind expressing this situation uses hyperbole to emphasize the difference in expected versus actual duration.

the contrast between expecting a short mutual exchange (dua) and ending up in a longer conversation introduces an element of sarcasm, as it highlights the exaggeration in response to what was meant to be a quick act.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **keywords and phrases:** the use of phrases such as ""what the hell has happened"" and ""left alone more bouncers than played"" suggests a tone of confusion and disbelief.
- **sentimental indicators:** the mention of ""got a review right"" could indicate an unexpected positive event, though the overall sentiment seems negative or critical.

### step 2: deduction of true intent

- **rhetorical devices:** the question ""what the hell has happened..."" suggests rhetorical exaggeration, emphasizing that shahid afridi's behavior is surprising and uncharacteristic.
- **language style:** the language is informal and conversational, with a hint of sarcasm implied through the unexpected praises and the rhetorical question structure.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment appears critical and disbelieving, drawing attention to unexpected and unusual behavior. upon closer inspection, the exaggerated phrasing and unexpected compliment of getting a review right, juxtaposed with otherwise negative assessments, suggest a sarcastic undertone.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.

- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

the surface sentiment appears positive. phrases such as ""one of my favorites in league"" and ""should go all out for rondo"" suggest enthusiasm and support for the mentioned basketball lineup and the player rondo.

### step 2: true intention
we need to deduce if this positive sentiment might actually be masking a sarcastic undertone. the statement is declaring a lineup with several well-known but controversial players whose effectiveness could be disputed. there is no obvious use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the speaker is not being sincere. if the speaker genuinely disagrees with the lineup's potential, they might use irony or exaggeration to criticize it subtly.

### step 3: compare and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, there is no clear indication of sarcasm through the use of language or rhetorical devices. the positive sentiment seems direct and genuine, without layers of hidden meaning.

the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

        ","### example:
input: i hate waking up in the mornings 😒#basicbrianna #not #an #early #bird

steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** ""i hate,"" indicating a negative sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""hate"" and the tired face emoji 😒 further emphasize a negative sentiment.
- **hashtags analysis:** #not #an #early #bird suggests a sentiment of dislike towards waking up early.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the sentence uses exaggerated negativity (""i hate waking up"") which can be an indicator of sarcasm, especially combined with the emoji and hashtags.
- **language style:** the use of affirmative statement ""i hate"" along with the emoji 😒 and hashtags indicates a tone that suggests the person does not genuinely mean what they are saying, as they are describing a common experience in a hyperbolic way to imply amusement or frustration.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** while the surface sentiment is negative, the exaggerated language and additional context suggest an ironic tone typical of sarcasm. the person likely uses hyperbole and marked negativity to playfully complain rather than express genuine dislike.

Input:
@panndder @mylittlebloggie @bloisolson how dare you accuse me of being a boomer.

Steps:
step 1: identify surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment appears defensive and indignant, marked by the phrase ""how dare you accuse me,"" which typically expresses offense or affront. no sentimental phrases or emojis suggest a humorous or exaggerated tone.

step 2: deduce true intention:
the language style does not contain exaggerated praise, irony, or humor typically associated with sarcasm. the direct confrontation ""how dare you"" signals genuine indignation and a straightforward response to an accusation.

step 3: compare and analyze:
the surface sentiment of defensiveness aligns with the true intention of expressing genuine indignation. no discrepancy between the apparent emotion and the underlying purpose was identified.

        ","### step 1: identify surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears positive and enthusiastic, marked by the phrase ""yeah amazing night"" and the promise to ""let u know xx,"" which signifies a friendly and enthusiastic tone. the use of ""xx"" (kisses) typically suggests warmth or affection.

### step 2: deduce true intention
the phrase ""i think he out till the death!"" could be interpreted as an exaggeration. in context, it likely means the person stayed out very late or partied hard. such an exaggeration is often used humorously or to emphasize a point, but it's crucial to recognize if this humor leans toward sarcasm or not. given the positive context and lack of any indicators that indicate displeasure or cynicism, the intent does not seem sarcastic.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of enthusiasm and positivity matches the true intention of sharing a positive, albeit exaggerated, statement about someone's night out. there is no apparent irony, exaggerated praise, or contradictory emotion to suggest sarcasm.

Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

- surface sentiment: the surface sentiment is neutral, simply stating a fact about a song title.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" indicates that the author is pointing out irony in the situation. this suggests that the author does not genuinely mean the song title straightforwardly, but instead is highlighting a contrast or an unexpected twist related to the song.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is neutral, but the use of ""#irony"" suggests that the author is employing irony or sarcasm to convey a point that is opposite to or different from the literal meaning.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- the use of hashtags (#americans, #tax, #gps, #tracking, #cars, #trucks)
- slightly alarmist tone (""watch out"")

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""watch out"" often signals a warning or caution, which indicates disapproval.
- the sentiment may come from a place of concern or opposition.
- there is a possibility of sarcasm due to the exaggerated nature of hashtags and the alarmist tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

""i like listening to dads truck drivers tell me about them going to the strip joint and their old lady getting mad at them over it :face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""working me so hard""
- clues: the phrase ""working me so hard"" can indicate a strong emotional response, potentially frustration or exhaustion. the misspelling ""tonite"" (for ""tonight"") gives it a casual or informal tone.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""they working me so hard tonite"" implies that the speaker is being required to work a lot or more than usual in the evening.
- there's an implicit exaggeration in ""so hard"" that suggests the speaker may not be genuinely frustrated but could be trying to make a point through hyperbole.
- the casual tone paired with the exaggeration can indicate that the speaker is not fully serious and may be implying a complaint with a humorous or sarcastic undertone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: frustration or exhaustion from being overworked.
- true intention: the use of hyperbole and casual tone suggests that the speaker is not genuinely upset but using exaggeration to express a minor complaint, which aligns with a sarcastic undertone.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords**: ""wish"", ""government"", ""paid"", ""food"", ""#not"", ""#ebtbitches""
- **sentimental phrases or markers**: the phrase ""jeez i wish"" expresses a desire, while ""#not"" and ""#ebtbitches"" suggest negativity and disdain.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: sarcastic phrasing such as ""jeez i wish"" usually indicates sarcasm when combined with contradicting hashtags like ""#not"".
- **language style**: the hashtag ""#ebtbitches"" has a derogatory and contemptuous tone towards those who benefit from ebt (electronic benefit transfer), a system for providing food assistance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: initially appears to be a desire or wish.
- **true intention**: the sarcastic tone and use of negative hashtags reveal the speaker's disdain towards the idea of the government providing for their food.

### Example:
Input: am really fuckin paying for it today #tequila #is  #the #one

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:

        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

   - **hashtags:** #sarcasm
   - **sentimental phrases:** ""otherwise, they'll start doing exactly the same :)""
   - **emojis:** none specifically, but the phrase is closed with a smiley face "":)""

### step 2: true intention deduction
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of a specific hashtag #sarcasm suggests awareness of sarcasm in the text itself. the smiley face at the end further indicates that the sentence might not be serious and is likely employing sarcasm.
   - **intent:** the writer is suggesting that without a sarcasm marker, some followers might take posts too literally. this hyperbolic suggestion implicitly means they are perhaps poking fun at the need for such markers.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
   - on the surface, the sentence seems like a genuine suggestion for a sarcasm marker.
   - however, the true intention implies that the suggestion for a sarcasm marker is itself sarcastic, indirectly making fun of those who might not recognize sarcasm without it.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""pretty shitty day,"" ""soaked and full of mud and clay,"" ""#iliketogetdirty,"" ""#notreally,"" ""#sarcasm.""
- **sentimental phrases and hashtags:** ""pretty shitty day"" clearly indicates a negative context. the hashtags ""#notreally"" and ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicate sarcasm.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the negative phrase ""pretty shitty day"" and the description of unpleasant circumstances (being soaked and muddy) present a genuine surface sentiment of unhappiness and discomfort. the hashtags ""#notreally"" and ""#sarcasm"" directly suggest that the opposite is intended, indicating that the speaker actually dislikes the situation despite the initial implication of enjoyment in ""#iliketogetdirty.""

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment is negative (unpleasant day), the true intention amplified by explicit hashtags indicates that the speaker is being sarcastic about the situation.

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony

the sentence points out a frustrating situation where the advertisement works perfectly, yet the desired content (the video) doesn't. this contrast indicates the user is highlighting an annoying irony.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

Perfect time to get sick 😢 #not,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the surface sentiment is mixed. the phrase ""perfect time to get sick"" seems negative due to the context of ""getting sick"" being an undesirable occurrence, and the crying face emoji 😢 further emphasizes a negative emotional response. however, the hashtag ""#not"" suggests irony or contradiction.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention becomes clear when considering the hashtag ""#not,"" commonly used to indicate the opposite of what is stated. this creates an ironic or sarcastic effect by implying that it is definitely not a perfect time to get sick.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment mostly indicates negativity about getting sick, enhanced by the emoji. the hashtag ""#not"" confirms the contradictory, sarcastic tone by directly opposing the statement ""perfect time to get sick.""

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style includes rhetorical questioning (""i wonder if anyone ever look past my appearance and see what i'm feeling"") which suggests that the speaker feels overlooked and underappreciated. the combination of emotional phrases and the distress emoji indicates a deeper sense of frustration and longing for recognition. this sentiment and use of rhetorical questioning frequently suggest sarcasm, as the speaker may feel that the appreciation they seek is unlikely to happen.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment indicates distress and a plea for emotional validation, while the true intention appears to show frustration and possibly sarcasm about the lack of recognition and appreciation the speaker is experiencing. given the rhetorical questioning and the context, it is likely that the sentiment is sarcastic.

i see the #irony of my last 3 tweets combined was lost entirely on a certain someone... faith in humanity: -3% :(

### response:

let's analyze the tweet step by step.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and sentimental phrases: ""irony,"" ""lost entirely,"" ""certain someone,"" ""faith in humanity: -3%,"" and the sad emoji "":(.""
- overall, the language suggests frustration and disappointment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the tweet uses sarcasm and irony explicitly with the hashtag ""#irony"" and the sentiment ""faith in humanity: -3% :(.""
- the exaggerated negative percentage and sad emoji indicate the speaker's mock disappointment.
- the capitalization of ""my last 3 tweets combined"" adds emphasis, often a hallmark of sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiments of frustration and disappointment align with the use of ironic and sarcastic language.
- the tweet implies that the audience missed the sarcasm or irony in previous tweets, leading to the speaker's exasperation.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""lol"" and ""hilarious"" are keywords that typically convey humor and positive sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the usage of ""lol"" (laughing out loud) and ""hilarious"" (very funny) suggests a humorous and positive tone.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** despite the positive surface sentiment, the combination of ""lol"" and ""hilarious"" could suggest exaggeration, which is a common device used in sarcasm.
- **language style:** the phrase ""hilarious pic"" in conjunction with the context of a game could imply that the intent is not to genuinely find the picture hilarious but rather to mock or suggest an underlying criticism or disbelief.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is humorous and positive as indicated by ""lol"" and ""hilarious."" however, when analyzing the potential for exaggeration and the context of a game, it seems plausible that the true intent might be sarcastic as it could be making fun of the situation rather than genuinely finding it humorous.

***step-by-step analysis:***

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""change is a process,"" ""not an event""
- clues: the inclusion of ""dafuq you thinking"" at the end hints at a strong emotional reaction that contradicts a straightforward, informative statement.

**step 2: true intention**
- the first part of the statement ""change is a process, not an event"" is a commonly accepted idea presented in a neutral manner.
- however, the phrase ""dafuq you thinking"" introduces a contradictory tone. this suggests that the author finds someone's opposing view or expectation absurd.
- the juxtaposition of a formal statement with an informal, almost aggressive rebuttal indicates a rhetorical device (irony/sarcasm).

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the true intention contrasts sharply with the surface sentiment, revealing underlying sarcasm.
- the dismissal embedded in ""dafuq you thinking"" underscores the sarcastic tone, aimed at mocking a perceived simplistic or faulty understanding by someone else.

thus, the label is clearly ""sarcastic.""",1

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

- the post includes keywords like #sale, #not, #pursue, #serving, which convey a message about a sale and service. the language does not inherently suggest positivity or negativity, but there are elements that might hint at a contrast between what one might expect and the reality being described.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language includes a contrast where it states a sale is not something you pursue but something that happens to you while you're immersed in serving. the use of hashtags to separate the sentence could imply emphasis on certain words to shape the reader's understanding. the statement could be interpreted as straightforward advice or as subtle commentary on the nature of sales.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- upon analysis, the structure of the sentence and the emphasis created by the hashtags could suggest a sense of irony or a rhetorical stance. this implies that the author might be suggesting that chasing sales isn't as glamorous or effective as being service-oriented, thus indicating a possible underlying sarcastic tone.

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- sentimental phrases: ""played a part,"" ""sole credit""
- clues: the use of the winking emoji "";)"" often suggests that the statement should not be taken at face value and can be indicative of a joking or sarcastic tone.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence suggests that the speaker contributed to something but is implying, with the use of the emoji, that there's more complexity to their involvement than they are letting on.
- the addition of ""but i wont take sole credit"" could suggest humility, but combined with the winking emoji, it implies that the speaker might actually feel they deserve more recognition than they are publicly claiming.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the statement can seem humble and self-effacing.
- true intention: however, the winking emoji indicates the speaker is not serious and may actually be implying they did more than they claim.
- this discrepancy and the use of a winking emoji suggest that the statement is sarcastic.

"@Sharm33n @DJNoreenKhan I thought it was, what I call, the wet look lol",0,"
### Example:
Input: am really fuckin paying for it today #tequila #is  #the #one

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

- **emojis:** none present. however, ""lol"" suggests a light-hearted tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the statement includes ""lol,"" which indicates that the speaker might be joking or not taking the statement fully seriously. the phrase ""the wet look"" could be humorously downplaying or making light of a situation, potentially one where someone got unintentionally wet (e.g., due to rain).

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment suggests a humorous or joking manner, particularly with the inclusion of ""lol."" 
- the true intention, considering the casual mention of ""the wet look,"" likely implies that the speaker did not genuinely believe that the wet appearance was originally intended or desired.
- this contrast—of calling something ""the wet look"" (which might suggest intentional style) while actually implying it was unintentional—suggests a sarcastic tone.

A burned tongue is a lovely way to start the day #sarcasm #ouch,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""a burned tongue is a lovely way to start the day"" contains the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" and ""#ouch"". the word ""lovely"" typically has positive connotations, while ""burned tongue"" and ""#ouch"" imply something unpleasant or painful.

### step 2: true intention
by combining ""burned tongue"" with ""lovely"" and the hashtag ""#sarcasm"", the speaker clearly intends to juxtapose a negative experience with a positive description in a manner meant to be humorous or ironic. the use of ""#sarcasm"" unequivocally indicates that the statement should not be taken literally.

### step 3: compare and analysis
the surface sentiment, with the positive term ""lovely"" and negative experiences ""burned tongue"" and ""#ouch"", alongside the explicit mention of ""#sarcasm"", confirms the statement's true meaning as sarcastic. the speaker is ironically stating that a burned tongue is an awful way to start the day.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

the statement describes the situation as ironic and implies that the perceived victory of the hacker/underdog (""the little man"") is not really a victory because ""in reality the state won."" this implies that those who think the hacker has succeeded are deluding themselves and that their belief is naive or misguided.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the apparent support for the hacker's success is not genuine. instead, the use of ""irony"" and the statement that ""in reality the state won"" undercuts any positive sentiment, signaling that the writer is making fun of the idea that the hacker's actions were a real triumph.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have mixed sentiments. the phrases ""so ill. it actually hurts to breathe."" convey a negative sentiment, while ""still that nice long walk to the station did me the world of good"" conveys a positive sentiment. however, the use of ""#not"" hints at the possibility of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
examining the structure and language style further, the contrast between the negative sentiment of being ill and the positive sentiment of a long walk being good, combined with the hashtag ""#not,"" strongly suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what is stated in the phrase about the walk being beneficial.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment (mixed/positive) with the underlying sentiment (negative/frustrated), the clear incongruity indicates sarcasm. the hashtag ""#not"" serves to negate the positive statement about the walk, making it clear that the statement is sarcastic.

@tyquorshaaa: jackie just had the best joke i've heard in awhile | :face_with_tears_of_joy::weary_face::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- keywords and phrases: ""snuggles up to the royals with giddy glee"" suggests a positive sentiment, implying enthusiasm and happiness.
- hashtag: ""#irony"" is a strong indicator that the surface sentiment may not reflect the true intention.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" signals that the action described is likely not genuine and may be intended to be interpreted ironically.
- language style: the phrase ""snuggles up...with giddy glee"" is exaggerated and overly positive, often used in a context that suggests insincerity when combined with irony.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears enthusiastic and positive.
- however, the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly suggests that the speaker does not genuinely mean the enthusiastic action described.
- given the use of ""irony"" and the exaggerated language, it is reasonable to deduce that the actual sentiment is sarcastic.

those were some great last minute substitutions @tomcrean

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

step 1: surface sentiment
- sentimental phrases: ""surrealist,"" ""welcome""
- clues: the phrase ""welcome to the surrealist estate agency!!"" does not contain any overtly emotional or sentimental phrases on its own. however, the use of “surrealist” and two exclamation marks suggest a certain level of enthusiasm or excitement.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""welcome to the surrealist estate agency!!"" employs ""surrealist"" which refers to something bizarre or irrational. given that an estate agency is expected to deal with straightforward, practical matters, calling it ""surrealist"" implies a contradiction.
- the term ""surrealist"" alongside the excitement in the greeting suggests that the situation being referred to is not normal or conventional, possibly mocking any irregularities or illogical occurrences related to the estate agency.
  
step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: on the surface, using ""welcome"" and exclamatory marks gives a positive tone.
- true intention: the use of the term ""surrealist"" suggests the author is likely criticizing or mocking the estate agency for being irrational or bizarre, which is further supported by the otherwise positive tone used in a clearly inappropriate context (estate agency should be straightforward).
- given these points, the sentence likely carries sarcasm.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

the given tweet ""#average #ball #not #party #ping #pong #homedecor please rt: http://t.co/t4r61yqf6t http://t.co/uisu74kglv"" primarily consists of hashtags and a request to retweet, accompanied by urls. the surface sentiment is neutral: it doesn't employ any sentimental keywords, phrases, or emojis that suggest sarcasm. the true intention appears to be a straightforward promotion or sharing of content, likely about table tennis-related home decor. the message lacks the hallmarks of sarcasm such as contrasting statements, hyperbolic or ironic language. therefore, the correct label is ""not sarcastic"".",0
The fucking car just gave up..! #car #died #not-happy,0,"
### Example:
Input: am really fuckin paying for it today #tequila #is  #the #one

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

- **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""fucking car just gave up""
   - **hashtags:** #car, #died, #not-happy
   - **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""fucking car just gave up"" indicates frustration and disappointment.
   - **emojis:** none present

- **true intention deduction:**
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of explicit language (""fucking"") and the straightforward nature of the statement suggest authentic frustration and disappointment about the car breaking down.

   - both surface sentiment (frustration, disappointment) and true intention (genuine frustration about the car malfunction) are aligned directly with the expression.

since there is no contrast or underlying opposite meaning typically associated with sarcasm, the statement is labeled as not sarcastic.",0

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the phrase ""like the feeling"" seems positive at first glance, but the laughter ""ahahahaha"" and the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" introduce irony.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the statement is using sarcasm to convey that while people may think they are ahead, the speaker believes they are actually far behind. the laughter ""ahahahaha"" reinforces the mocking tone, and the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly labels the statement as sarcastic.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment appears mixed due to the initial positive phrase but is quickly contradicted by the subsequent claim (""miles and miles behind"") and the indicators of sarcasm. the true intention is to mock those who believe they are ahead, indicating that they are actually far behind.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**

- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**

- the hashtag ""#not!"" strongly suggests a negation of any positive sentiment or fairness implied earlier.

### step 2: true intention

- the specific hours ""from 3 pm to 8 pm"" coupled with ""with my son today"" might suggest that this is not a sufficient or desired time span for the speaker, indicating discontent or frustration.
- the hashtag ""#not!"" sarcastically negates any notion of fairness, making it clear that the speaker does not find the situation fair at all.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

the phrase seems confrontational and potentially derogatory due to the use of the expletive ""chu***"" and the context provided by ""#irony.""

### step 2: true intention
the use of ""#irony"" suggests that the speaker is using irony, a form of sarcasm, to indicate that the idea they are presenting should not be taken at face value. the statement about a marathi man speaking hindi and being derogatorily labeled implies that the speaker finds this stereotype unfair or absurd.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment appears negative and confrontational due to the explicit language used. the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unfairness of a stereotype using irony. by comparing the two, it becomes clear that the negative sentiment is not genuine but a rhetorical device to mock the stereotype.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment

- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""lesson learnt?"", ""herd of sheep"", ""struggling to sell them""
- sentimental phrases: ""lesson learnt?""

the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and observational. the use of ""lesson learnt?"" suggests a reflective tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony, comparison
- language style: casual, critical

the phrase ""herd of sheep who fought over tvs on #blackfriday struggling to sell them"" contains irony. the term ""herd of sheep"" implies a comparison to people mindlessly following a trend, highlighting the consumers' folly. the hashtag ""#irony"" further suggests that there is an ironic tone to the message. the context indicates that the true intention is to criticize the behavior of consumers who eagerly bought tvs on black friday, only to find themselves unable to sell them later.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is questioning and observational.
- true intention is critical and uses irony.

the surface sentiment and the true intention don't align straightforwardly. the questioning tone combined with the critical and ironic true intention suggests sarcasm.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (step 1) appears negative with phrases that indicate frustration and dissatisfaction.
- the true intention (step 2) clearly supports a sarcastic tone by using hashtags and phrases typically associated with sarcasm.

**analysis:**

step 1: **surface sentiment**: the tweet begins with ""thanks gori-san"" which appears positive and grateful. however, the accompanying hashtag ""#not for sale"" and the context of a link can complicate the interpretation.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""thanks gori-san"" can be read as sarcastic depending on the situation, especially since it is followed by a seemingly random hashtag ""#not for sale"" and a link. this phrase could depict ironic or mocking gratitude, implying the contrary of what it literally says.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**:
   - while the surface sentiment seems positive due to the ""thanks,"" the context and hashtag suggest that the gratitude may not be genuine.
   - the use of the hashtag ""#not for sale"" can imply an underlying tone of sarcasm, indicating that the thanks might not be sincere. 

given the mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention, which suggests irony or sarcasm, the label is ""sarcastic.""",1

@TorontoStar: NDP to introduce bill to make OHIP public #not appropriate # confidentiality,0,"
### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""

   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

- **emojis:** none present.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** there is a straightforward declaration that the issue lies with singles, not doubles. the emphasis on ""always"" signifies a continual problem, but there is no exaggerated, indirect, or biting tone typically associated with sarcasm.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat positive and cheerful. phrases like ""yay yet another week"" and ""to brighten my day"" are generally associated with enthusiasm and positivity. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" specifically hints towards a potential sarcastic tone.

### step 2: true intention
upon closer inspection, the exaggerated enthusiasm for a situation that is generally considered undesirable (having a child home ill for another week) suggests that the person is not genuinely happy. additionally, the explicit mention of ""#sarcasm"" reinforces the idea that the positive sentiment in the phrase is not meant to be taken literally.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear contrast between the surface sentiment (which seems positive) and the true intention (expressing frustration or dissatisfaction). the language, combined with the explicit mention of sarcasm, indicates that the speaker is using sarcasm to convey their real feelings about the situation.

- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### response:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment seems mixed or negative, inferred from words like #scowls, #ignorance, and the broken-heart emoji 💔. the use of emojis like 👊💥 also implies anger or frustration. the phrases suggest inconsistencies in attitudes based on the presence of money, which might indicate criticism or discontent.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the tweet uses repetition and juxtaposition (""#smiles when there is #money|#scowls when there is #not"") to contrast behaviors contingent on having money. this stylistic choice implies a deeper criticism of superficiality and materialistic hypocrisy. the emojis further enhance the critique, potentially displaying frustration with societal or personal attitudes toward wealth.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment hints at frustration, while the true intention uses rhetorical contrast and possibly satire to critique materialism. the emotional and critical tone of the message, combined with rhetorical devices, leans towards sarcasm, as the user seems to be mocking those attitudes.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love,"" ""lied to,"" ""not""
- sentimental phrases or markers: the phrase ""gotta love being lied to"" superficially suggests a positive sentiment, but the inclusion of ""#not"" negates it.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""gotta love"" is used sarcastically, as indicated by the hashtag ""#not"" which reverses the literal meaning.
- language style: the use of ""gotta love"" typically expresses enjoyment or approval, but when paired with a negative event (""being lied to""), it clearly indicates sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment might initially seem positive when reading ""gotta love,"" but the context of ""being lied to"" and the hashtag ""#not"" change it to negative.
- true intention, informed by the use of the rhetorical device and context, indicates the speaker is being sarcastic about not loving being lied to.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears negative based on the phrase ""i hate you."" however, the inclusion of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) and the casual tone may indicate a non-serious intent.

### step 2: true intention
the use of ""lol"" suggests that the statement is not meant to be taken literally. it is likely being used humorously or playfully, which is a common context for sarcasm. the casual tone and juxtaposition of ""i hate you"" with ""lol"" indicate that the speaker does not genuinely mean what they are saying.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the discrepancy between the negative phrase ""i hate you"" and the lighthearted ""lol"" suggests that the surface sentiment (negativity) contrasts with the true intention (playfulness or humor). this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm, where the literal meaning differs from the intended meaning.

- the post mentions a ""shopping day"" which might typically be seen as a positive activity. however, the keywords ""tired and broke now"" convey a sense of exhaustion and financial strain, which are negative sentiments.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the mention of ms 15 implies the speaker is with a 15-year-old (possibly their daughter), which can be a point of pride. listing the haul items like ""new docs, eyeliner, bras, new issue frankie mag, and half of kikki k"" suggests they bought a lot of things, which sounds exaggerated for effect.
- the phrase ""tired and broke now"" humorously contrasts with the earlier excitement of shopping, indicating a potential underlying sarcasm—suggesting the effort and money spent took a toll.
- the overall language style, particularly the hyperbolic statement ""half of kikki k"", signals a light-hearted, possibly sarcastic tone.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- combining the exaggerated tone about the haul and the negative aftermath sentiment, it leans towards being sarcastic. the initial excitement about shopping is downplayed by the concluding exhaustion and financial drain.

   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- **keywords:** sweet jeebus!, confirm very high to phenomenal seas, north atlantic low
- **sentimental phrases:** ""sweet jeebus!"" can be an exclamation of surprise or astonishment.
- **emojis:** none present.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""sweet jeebus!"" is a mild exclamation and does not inherently suggest sarcasm. the rest of the sentence is a straightforward sharing of factual information regarding sea conditions verified by satellite data. the tweet appears factual and informative.
- **context analysis:** the inclusion of metrics and sources (cryosat & jason-2) suggests a report-like nature.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment:** surprise or astonishment (mild)
- **true intention:** sharing factual data with a touch of astonishment at the severity of the situation
- **alignment:** the sentence's exclamatory part does not negate the factual portion, and there is no contrasting emotional subtext (which is a hallmark of sarcasm).

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""hyper at 1am"" juxtaposed with ""i really should be getting rest"" indicates a clear contrast. the hashtag #ohwhale is a playful way of saying ""oh well,"" indicating a casual acceptance of a less than ideal situation.
- **language style:** the language is informal and playful, indicating that the speaker might be making light of the fact that they are not resting as they should.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment shows a humorous lament about a situation that should be less than ideal (being hyper when rest is needed). the true intent is to highlight the irony of the situation humorously. this contrast and playful acceptance typically align with sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

### Example:
Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

        ","### step 1:
the surface sentiment of the input text is somewhat neutral. phrases like ""it also makes me want to post this"" do not indicate clear positive or negative emotion. there are no emojis or sentimental phrases that provide additional clues about the sentiment.

### step 2:
the language style is casual and it reads like a continuation of a conversation. however, without additional context, it is challenging to deduce the true intention. the phrase ""it also makes me want to post this"" might imply an action related to the previous conversation, but the absence of keywords or rhetorical devices that clearly signal sarcasm makes it difficult to interpret.

### step 3:
comparing the neutral sentiment from step 1 with the analysis in step 2, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm. the text reads straightforwardly. therefore, based on the available information, it seems more likely that the comment is genuine.

@tyquorshaaa: jackie just had the best joke i've heard in awhile | :face_with_tears_of_joy::weary_face::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

Oh how I love working in Baltimore #not,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

the surface sentiment appears to be positive due to the phrase ""oh how i love working in baltimore.""

the use of the hashtag ""#not"" at the end of the sentence indicates that the speaker actually means the opposite of what is superficially stated. the hashtag ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (positive) is directly contradicted by the indicator ""#not,"" which implies a negative or opposite sentiment. this incongruity between the stated sentiment and the actual intention confirms that the statement is sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
guess its just me, brett and my mom this year. gotta love my family!

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

the sentiment of the message appears to be a mix of excitement and anxiety. key indicators include the repeated phrase ""3 more nights"" and the use of the 😬 emojis, which can indicate nervousness or reluctance.

**step 2: true intention**
to determine the true intention, we must consider the rhetorical devices and context. the combination of the countdown (""3 more nights"") and the 😬 emojis suggests that the speaker is likely feeling ambivalent or uneasy about the upcoming event. however, the hashtag ""#londoncalling"" shows that the event might be something significant. there isn't any sophisticated language or sarcasm-indicative phrases that suggest an incongruence between the surface sentiment and the true meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze:
the surface sentiment of defensiveness aligns with the true intention of expressing genuine indignation. no discrepancy between the apparent emotion and the underlying purpose was identified.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment in the sentence appears analytical and strategic. phrases like ""a lot of factors at play"" and ""i think you do retain him at max"" suggest a carefully considered opinion about a decision. the phrase ""hopefully the ft's hurt his market a bit, selfishly speaking"" indicates a hope that a player's free throw performance might negatively impact his market value, which would be advantageous for the speaker.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""selfishly speaking"" hints at underlying personal gain, showing some self-awareness and a hint of humor. however, the hope that a player's free throw performance reduces his market value is genuine and expresses a legitimate desire for a cheaper contract. 

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align towards a strategic and somewhat humorous reflection of a hope for personal gain. the humor in ""selfishly speaking"" does not convey sarcasm but a candid admission of the speaker’s personal interest. no ironic or exaggerated praise here typically associated with sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""i like listening to dads truck drivers tell me about them going to the strip joint and their old lady getting mad at them over it :face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the content of the sentence involves truck drivers talking about visiting strip joints and their wives getting angry, which is typically not something people genuinely enjoy hearing about.
- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is sharply contrasted by the actual content (which implies annoyance or discomfort), indicating sarcasm.

- the surface sentiment (shock and surprise) is clearly contradicted by the true intention (expectation and dismissal of the professed shock), indicating the use of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

### step 2: true intention
the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" signals that the statement should not be taken at face value. the concepts of a ""republican move"" robbing a ""royal family"" and a ""32k meal"" suggest an extravagant and perhaps unjust scenario. the speaker likely disagrees with these actions and is using irony to highlight the absurdity.

- **surface vs. true meaning:** surface sentiment appears to mix traditional holiday cheer (""whitechristmas"") with a negation (""#not""). the true intention is to indicate frustration or dissatisfaction about the snow in chicago, implying the speaker does not enjoy the situation and is being sarcastic about the typical positive connotation of a ""white christmas.""

Input:
@tyquorshaaa: jackie just had the best joke i've heard in awhile | :face_with_tears_of_joy::weary_face::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**

- the statement ""not #sarcasm"" suggests an attempt to imply the existence of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- given the context of the nfl, it is highly unlikely that there are no interesting stories or that it isn’t getting attention. the nfl is known for its continuous media coverage and stories.
- the word ""not"" in capitals along with the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" at the end provides a very strong cue that the author is indeed being sarcastic.

   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

explanation:

1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""felicitats"" (which is catalan for ""congratulations"")
   - **hashtags:** #penedesfera, #notcies
   - **sentimental phrases:** the term ""felicitats"" indicates a positive sentiment of congratulation.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:**
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of the word ""felicitats"" straightforwardly expresses a congratulatory message. there is no indication of irony or sarcasm given the lack of negative phrasing or context suggesting otherwise.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (congratulation) and the true intention (genuine congratulations) align directly. there is no presence of the usual indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggerated negativity or contradiction between the surface sentiment and the true intention.

given the lack of elements suggesting sarcasm and the straightforward positive sentiment, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0
Cook and England rudderless at the death. Seven games and we've got progressively worse! Can't wait 'till they arrive here for WC #sarcasm,1,"
### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **sentimental phrases and hashtags:** the expression ""rudderless at the death"" and ""progressively worse"" are negative. the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" directly indicates ironic or sarcastic intent.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the phrase ""can't wait 'till they arrive here for wc"" typically suggests excitement. however, the context of documented failure (""rudderless,"" ""progressively worse"") and the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" convey that the statement is sarcastic. it suggests disappointment and disbelief rather than genuine anticipation.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment (progressively worse, rudderless) is negative, and the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" underscores that the final sentence, which appears positive, is actually sarcastic. the genuine meaning is that the speaker is not looking forward to the team's performance at the world cup due to their poor current form.

- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""johnny football"" (a reference to johnny manziel), ""not a fun time anymore.""
- **sentimental indicators:** the phrase ""not a fun time anymore"" indicates a negative sentiment.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

""hello world"" could indicate a greeting or readiness for the day, while ""not,"" ""sleepy,"" ""tired,"" and ""nothanks"" indicate a lack of enthusiasm and fatigue. 

### step 2: true intention
the use of conflicting hashtags shows a contrast between the expectation of starting the day (""helloworld"") and the speaker's actual feelings (""not,"" ""sleepy,"" ""tired,"" ""nothanks""). the phrase ""08:01am on the dot and the buzzer rings"" sets a factual state but when combined with the hashtags, it becomes clear that the speaker is being sarcastic about their readiness for the day.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows a mix of expectation and the actual feeling of reluctance. ""#helloworld"" is contrasted sharply by the other hashtags, which reveal a negative sentiment towards waking up early. the use of these conflicting expressions indicates sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be one of lament and frustration. this is indicated by the use of emojis 😭😭, which typically denote crying or sadness, and the context of having a busy schedule with games on monday, tuesday, friday, and saturday.

### step 2: true intention
examining the language, there is a high likelihood that the statement is not expressing genuine desire to have so many games. the emojis of crying suggest that the writer is not actually happy about the situation, despite not revealing outrightly through traditional negative words. given this, the language might carry a sense of exaggeration regarding the burdensome number of games, implying that it's too much.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
although on the surface, the statement might just seem like a lament, the use of crying emojis and the listing of multiple days heavily implies an exaggerated discontent, which can be seen as a form of sarcasm. there is a discrepancy between the straightforward listing of days and the emotional response indicated by emojis.

- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment appears enthusiastic and positive, yet the hashtag ""#not"" and the exaggerated tone indicate that the true intent is to express a lack of excitement sarcastically.

Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: the use of the phrase ""whip up"" and ""chocolate pudding election"" creates a humorous and whimsical image but lacks a clear positive or negative sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- the tweet seems to be using juxtaposition and absurdity to comment on economic issues influencing israeli elections. ""chocolate pudding election"" is an exaggerated, humorous phrase that doesn't realistically describe an election, suggesting the use of irony.
- the tweet is likely pointing out the trivialization or absurd aspects of something as serious as economic issues and elections.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is ambiguous but contains humor and exaggerated language.
- the true intention, revealed through the use of irony and juxtaposition, shows a sarcastic tone, suggesting that the tweet is not serious when mentioning ""chocolate pudding election.""

### step-by-step analysis:

- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - keywords and sentimental phrases: ""better than no minutes"" suggests a positive outlook in a literal sense.
  - however, the provided context (three minutes) is notably minimal.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - rhetorical devices: this statement uses irony. it implies that the person is given only a very small amount of time, which is far from satisfactory.
  - language style: sarcastic undertone, as the literal meaning suggests a positive outlook, but the minimal time ('three minutes') makes it clear the person feels inadequacy or dissatisfaction.

- **step 3: compare and analyze:**
  - surface sentiment suggests a mild positive statement (better than none).
  - true intention reveals dissatisfaction and sarcasm due to the inadequacy of the time mentioned.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

### Example:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the sentence appears to use irony, as the statement ""the ones that caught me by surprise were the ones i didn't expect"" is tautologically true but is presented as if it's an insightful revelation.
- **language style:** the repeated use of hashtags (#duh and #redundantredundant) and their meanings suggest a mocking or sarcastic attitude towards the statement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

step 2: deduce true intention:
the sentence seems to use a rhetorical device, as it is unusual to comment on the spelling of a specific term without a context. given the uncommon nature of the term ""hoar frost,"" the statement could be hinting that ""hoar frost"" is a term many people find odd or difficult, perhaps implying an underlying sense of mockery.

step 3: compare and analyze:
the surface sentiment of being neutral contrasts with a potential underlying mockery or subtle jab at people who might struggle with the term. the combination of a neutral surface with a potentially mocking undertone points toward sarcasm.

### Example:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

the phrase ""ah the 2014 #gamergate ebola campaign. how many people did we kill?"" superficially doesn't carry any clear positive or negative sentiment, but the hashtag #sarcasm tells us that the statement is likely not straightforward.

### step 2: true intention
by examining the statement closely, it is clear that it mentions ""#gamergate"" and ""ebola campaign"" in a provocative way. the rhetorical question ""how many people did we kill?"" is obviously not meant to be taken literally; rather, it exaggerates the impact of the gamergate campaign, suggesting no actual harm was done in a literal sense.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is ambiguous, but the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly calls out the sentence's sarcastic nature. the exaggeration in the statement and the use of #sarcasm indicate that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated, making it sarcastic.

the presence of the hashtags ""#terror"" and ""#irony,"" along with the rhetorical questioning of ""where is the promise of 'peace on earth' in this?"" suggests a critical tone. it implies that the speaker is highlighting a discrepancy between the religious promise of peace and the current situation, possibly marked by violence or terror.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a stark contrast between the surface sentiment (which appears hopeful or prayerful) and the true intention (which is critical and points out a contradiction). the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly suggests that the statement is meant to be ironic, further reinforcing the notion that the sentiment is sarcastic.

- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""violent""
- **sentimental indicators:** the word ""violent"" typically conveys a negative sentiment.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement ""you are violent, it shows in your tweets"" could be leveraging a form of hyperbole or exaggeration, which is common in sarcastic remarks.
- **language style:** the use of all caps for ""you"" and the direct address with mentions (@handles) adds emphasis, which could indicate sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is negative due to the word ""violent."" upon deeper analysis, the exaggerated nature and emphatic style strongly suggest that the speaker is not sincerely accusing someone of being violent, but rather using sarcasm to criticize or mock the person's tweets.

Input:
@tyquorshaaa: jackie just had the best joke i've heard in awhile | :face_with_tears_of_joy::weary_face::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- keywords: ""pro at presentations"" suggests a positive skill or ability.
- hashtags: ""#not"" directly negates the preceding statement, while ""#choke"" implies failure under pressure.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm indicator ""#not"" used immediately after a positive statement (""pro at presentations"") is a strong signal of sarcasm. it implies the opposite of what's being stated.
- the hashtag ""#choke"" reinforces the sarcasm by indicating failure instead of proficiency.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears to be positive due to the phrase ""pro at presentations.""
- the true intention is clearly negative, as the subsequent ""#not"" and ""#choke"" suggest the person is not good at presentations and likely failed or performed poorly.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""nothing says nature,"" ""relentless sound of am commuter traffic,"" ""#fthunter,"" ""#amdogfun,"" ""#not@allpeaceful.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the phrase ""relentless sound of am commuter traffic"" typically isn't associated positively with nature. the hashtag ""#not@allpeaceful"" emphasizes this contradiction.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there is clear irony in this sentence. the phrase ""nothing says nature"" is typically used to evoke images of tranquility and peace. however, this is contrasted almost immediately with ""the relentless sound of am commuter traffic,"" which is the complete opposite of peaceful nature. the hashtags add to this irony, especially ""#not@allpeaceful,"" directly contradicting the supposed sentiment.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the sentence might have a surface layer of talking about nature, the true intention is ironic and highlighting a clear contradiction. the speaker is facetiously suggesting that am commuter traffic is like experiencing nature, which is obviously not intended to be taken at face value.

- **language style:** the sentence is descriptive and appears earnest in expressing a feeling of being frightened by the imagined scenario.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is one of fear or anxiety. the true intent also seems to be an expression of genuine fear or being creeped out by the thought of a dark creature. there is no evidence of sarcasm, and the straightforward language reinforces this interpretation.

the surface sentiment appears to be cheerful and positive, indicated by phrases like ""at least there's a good football game on"" and the use of ""lol"" which often conveys amusement or light-heartedness.

### step 2: deduce true intention
the phrase ""with zero chance of either of our teams losing"" conveys an underlying meaning. typically, both teams cannot lose simultaneously, so this statement is absurd on its face. the use of ""lol"" further suggests a humorous or mocking tone. the intended meaning is likely that neither team is playing, thus they cannot lose, which is ironical and hints at disappointment in their teams.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment suggests cheerfulness, but the unrealistic scenario and the use of ""lol"" point towards sarcasm. the true intention behind the statement is to mock the situation where neither of their teams has any risk of losing because they are not part of the good football game they're talking about.

        ### Label: 

        ","### input:
throwing up is exactly what i want to be doing at 7:30am... 😷😷😷 #not

### step 1: 
surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to express a certain level of enthusiasm or desire, using the phrase ""exactly what i want."" however, it is immediately undercut by the context and the use of sickness emojis (😷😷😷) and the hashtag ""#not"" which is a clear indicator of a negation of the previous statement.

### step 2:
true intention: the true intention is to express displeasure or disdain for the situation of throwing up early in the morning. the inclusion of ""😷😷😷"" emojis and the hashtag ""#not"" indicate that the speaker is being sarcastic and does not actually want to be vomiting.

### step 3: 
compare and analysis step 1 and step 2:
- the surface sentiment is misleadingly positive due to the phrase ""exactly what i want,"" but the true intention revealed through context and language style indicates a negative sentiment.
- this discrepancy between the surface statement and the true intention strongly indicates sarcasm.

Well this is great.. #sarcasm|Illinois Passes Bill That Makes It Illegal To Record The Police http://t.co/FZaY2AVx9t,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the sentence includes the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" which is a clear indicator that the statement is meant to be understood sarcastically. additionally, phrases like ""well this is great.."" often convey an insincere positive sentiment, further suggesting sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention is revealed by the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm."" the statement ""well this is great.."" when coupled with the news that ""illinois passes bill that makes it illegal to record the police"" is intended to express displeasure or disapproval, not genuine approval.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment presented as positive with ""well this is great.."" contrasts with the true intention, which is negative. this is evident through the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" and the context of the news, which the speaker likely finds unjust or problematic.

- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.

- keywords and sentimental phrases: ""naw"" — this suggests a negation or lack of interest.
- context: ""forest hills drive on my playlist"" — mentions an album by j. cole, which is critically acclaimed.
- overall, the surface sentiment seems to be dismissive or uninterested.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- rhetorical devices: the use of ""naw"" after mentioning ""forest hills drive"" (a well-regarded album) suggests a potential contradiction. the statement could imply the opposite of what is explicitly said — a common sarcastic device.
- language style: informal, abbreviated, and likely conversational.
- it is plausible that the negative sentiment (naw) is sarcastically highlighting the actual high regard for the playlist.

- the surface sentiment is dismissive, but the true intention might be to underscore the playlist's quality or personal attachment to the album by using sarcasm.

### response:

given the context and the hashtags used:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""full on man flu just in time for a weekend of work!!"" seems to express a negative situation.
- hashtags like ""#awesome"" and ""#sarcasm"" offer positive connotations, while ""#coldandflu"" is a negative but factual descriptor.

**step 2: true intention**
- the sentence describes an unfortunate situation (getting the flu right before a weekend of work).
- the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates the use of sarcasm, signaling that the statement is not genuinely positive.
- the hashtag ""#awesome"" is used ironically to express that the situation is actually bad, not good.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears mildly positive due to the word ""awesome"" but is heavily outweighed by the negative context of having the flu and the explicit ""#sarcasm"" tag.
- the true intention is to convey frustration or annoyance about being sick during a work weekend.

### Example:
Input:
""i like listening to dads truck drivers tell me about them going to the strip joint and their old lady getting mad at them over it :face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the content of the sentence involves truck drivers talking about visiting strip joints and their wives getting angry, which is typically not something people genuinely enjoy hearing about.
- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is sharply contrasted by the actual content (which implies annoyance or discomfort), indicating sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the quote ""people are not fighting for ideas, they fight for material benefits. to live in peace."" seems to present a straightforward statement regarding human motivations.
- the hashtags ""#irony"" and ""#yclnationalcongress"" are important clues, especially since irony is often a marker of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the quote itself juxtaposes ""material benefits"" with ""to live in peace,"" which can imply that the speaker finds it paradoxical or ironic that people seek material benefits as a means to achieve peace, possibly suggesting skepticism or criticism.
- the hashtag ""#irony"" strongly indicates that the statement should not be taken at face value, suggesting that there's a layer of sarcasm or critique about social or political behavior.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly positive if taken literally.
- the true intention, given the juxtaposition and #irony hashtag, is likely to express skepticism or sarcasm about people's motives in the context of fighting for material benefits under the guise of seeking peace.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

Love waking up to no heat in my apartment #not #socold,1,"
### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the phrase “love waking up to no heat” might initially seem positive due to the word ""love,"" but the use of ""#not"" suggests the opposite sentiment. ""#socold"" highlights the discomfort of the situation.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the statement uses irony and sarcasm. the word ""love"" is used opposite to its intended meaning, clarified by ""#not."" this indicates that the speaker does not actually love waking up to a cold apartment.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment may seem mixed, but the true meaning is clear sarcasm. the speaker is highlighting the unpleasantness of the situation by using a positive phrase (""love waking up"") which is then negated by ""#not.""

Nice weather for today.. #not 😠,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the phrase ""nice weather for today.."" initially seems positive. however, the hashtags ""#not"" and the angry emoji ""😠"" negate this positive sentiment, indicating displeasure or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
by using ""#not"" and the angry emoji, the speaker undermines the statement ""nice weather for today.."", suggesting that the weather is, in fact, not nice. this use of language and symbols creates a sarcastic tone, where the speaker means the opposite of what the words alone might suggest.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment initially appears positive but is negated by the contrasting hashtag and emoji. this contradiction between the initial statement and the accompanying negation devices reveals the sarcastic intent.

Input:

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- sentimental phrases: ""zach is a teacher,"" ""amirite?""
- clues: the use of ""amirite?"" (a colloquial and often sarcastic form of ""am i right?"") typically implies that the speaker expects agreement on a generally accepted or obvious fact. the context suggests an emphasis on something.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""i mean zach is a teacher, amirite?"" implies that the fact zach is a teacher should be inherently understood or significant in some manner. 
- the use of ""i mean"" at the beginning indicates that the speaker believes this should be self-explanatory.
- the addition of ""amirite?"" adds an element of seeking validation for an implied obvious point, which can often be sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: seeking validation for an obvious or significant statement.
- true intention: likely sarcastic, as the expectation for agreement on the obvious assumption that ""zach is a teacher"" implies the use of irony.

Wash hands with water? MOH is rubbing this on everyone's face? #irony http://t.co/sPgfZZIqLO,1,"
### Example:
Input:
@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

My body refuses to sleep. #fucccck,0,"
### Example:
Input: am really fuckin paying for it today #tequila #is  #the #one

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

the hashtags ""#not"", ""#fail"", and ""#footprint"" suggest a negative perception or disappointment about something related to decemberbessen. the use of hashtags can sometimes convey sarcasm, especially ""#not"" indicating a contradiction or negation.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is apologetic.
- true intention is likely negative or disappointed, possibly sarcastic due to the hashtags.

given the use of hashtags like ""#not"" and ""#fail,"" alongside an apologetic tone, the sentence likely carries an ironic or sarcastic undertone.

Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

**surface sentiment:** the keywords and phrases, ""hey sorry im late,"" indicate an apology, and ""i didnt want to come"" suggests a negative sentiment towards attending the event. the hashtag #myperiod might indicate an excuse based on menstruation.

### step 2:
**deduction of true intent:** the sentence employs sarcastic language. the statement ""sorry im late"" followed by ""i didnt want to come"" implies insincerity in the apology, since one does not typically apologize and admit they didn't want to come in the same breath. the hashtag #myperiod is used to justify the lateness, adding a layer of hyperbole because menstruation is unlikely to be the true reason for not wanting to attend.

### step 3:
**comparison and analysis:**
- **surface vs. true intent:** while the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of apology and excuse-making, the true intention is sarcastic. the claim that they didn't want to come and the use of the hashtag #myperiod highlights the underlying mockery or exaggeration rather than a genuine apology or explanation.

- true intention, indicated by the hashtag #irony, suggests that the statements are not to be taken at face value and might be communicating a deeper skepticism or criticism.

given the explicit reference to irony and the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention, the text is likely intended to be sarcastic.

### step 2: true intention
examining the language, there's an implied criticism about the decision-making regarding player usage. the phrase ""i guess not"" is key here, as it often signals that the speaker believes the expected outcome should have happened but didn't, which can imply a critical or mocking tone towards the decision-makers.

final labs coursework submitted!! now to treat myself by catching up with the whole semester's lectures #winning #not,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence carries mixed emotional indicators:
   - ""final labs coursework submitted!!"" suggests accomplishment and relief.
   - ""now to treat myself by catching up with the whole semester's lectures"" suggests an ironic burden rather than a treat.
   - hashtags ""winning"" (usually positive and triumphant) and ""not"" (negating the previous word) imply a conflict in intended sentiment.

#### step 2: true intention
the use of ""winning #not"" reveals that the speaker is expressing irony. the phrase ""winning #not"" turns a supposedly positive situation into a negative one. it humorously highlights the irony of needing to ""treat"" themselves with something undesirable (catching up on lectures).

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is conflicting with expressions of accomplishment and irony. the true intention, revealed by the contradictory nature of the hashtags and the context, is clearly sarcastic. the speaker does not mean to indicate that they are ""winning"" in a genuine sense but rather the opposite.

2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

step 2: true intention: by using ""dedicated to those days we dont want to throwback to,"" the tweet employs a rhetorical device known as irony, as throwback posts are usually meant for reminiscing fondly about the past. the capitalization of ""dont"" emphasizes the true dislike for the memory.

step 3: comparison and analysis: both the surface sentiment and true intention suggest a negative recollection, but the use of irony and the emphasis on not wanting to remember these days classify the tweet as sarcastic.",1
Today is going to be a great day . #not. 😔,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

### Example:
Input:
""oh look at me! i'm making people happy! i'm a magical man from happy land! who lives in a gumdrop house on lolly pop lane!""

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

the surface sentiment of the input text is negative, indicated by the phrase ""#not impressed.""

### step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes clearer upon closer inspection. the statement ""so apparently twitter is free... so why is my data being depleted using twitter?"" suggests that the speaker is highlighting a contradiction. the use of ""apparently"" and the trailing ellipses indicate skepticism or disbelief. the hashtag ""#not impressed"" compounds this by explicitly stating dissatisfaction.

### step 3: compare and analysis
the contrast between the claim that ""twitter is free"" and the complaint about data depletion implies dissatisfaction and is presented in a way that mocks the notion of ""free."" this indicates sarcasm, as the speaker is expressing their frustration in an ironic manner.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the phrase ""josh smith was tremendous tonight"" typically conveys a positive sentiment and praise.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""tough crowd"" can suggest that the audience was not receptive or appreciative, which might imply that the performance was not well-received despite the claim of being ""tremendous."" this contrast hints at sarcasm.
- **language style:** the statement uses the juxtaposition of ""tough crowd"" with ""was tremendous,"" which is a common indicator of sarcasm when positive statements are followed by a contrary context, implying doubt about the sincerity of the positive statement.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** surface sentiment expresses positivity about josh smith's performance. however, the context provided by ""tough crowd"" implies that the true intent is likely to mock or criticize the performance subtly. therefore, the surface sentiment contrasts sharply with the true intention, which points towards sarcasm.

the phrase ""trying hard to be fragile and petite"" combined with ""hahaha"" indicates a humorous tone. the exaggerated ""liabeeeeee"" and the context of new year's wishes might be affectionate teasing. the excessive ""hahaha"" and laughing emojis can also suggest that the speaker is not being entirely serious.

### Example:
Input:
@tyquorshaaa: jackie just had the best joke i've heard in awhile | :face_with_tears_of_joy::weary_face::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey::see-no-evil_monkey:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- keywords: ""someone took my lucky hat today"", ""yay"", ""isn't that fun"".
- overall impression: seemingly positive but forced cheerfulness.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the statement includes ""yay"" and ""isn't that fun"", which are typically positive but seem out of place in the context of someone losing something important (""lucky hat""). the use of ""yay"" and ""isn't that fun"" can be interpreted as sarcasm.
- hashtags: ""#sarcasm"" and ""#ihopeigetitback"" directly indicate that the initial sentiment is not genuine.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment appears superficially positive due to the cheerfulness implied by ""yay"" and ""isn't that fun"".
- the true intention is clearly sarcastic as indicated by the context and the use of hashtags.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the phrase ""i wouldn't say she has tits"" can be interpreted as a blunt or potentially dismissive statement. the use of the emoji ""😁"" generally conveys a smiling face, which can be intended to soften the statement or add a light-hearted tone. however, this combination often hints at a sarcastic or facetiously humorous intent.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the phrase ""i wouldn't say she has tits"" followed by a smiling emoji suggests that the speaker might be using sarcasm to imply the opposite of what is stated. the emoji's presence indicates a non-serious, playful tone, suggesting the speaker is not being literal and is instead making a sarcastic remark.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment seems dismissive but lightened by the emoji, which hints at sarcasm. the true intention, derived from the language and style, also points towards a sarcastic remark intended to be humorous or teasing rather than serious.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the analogy to ""jim bowen on bullseye"" is a well-known sarcastic trope where a game show host shows contestants what they missed out on, often making them feel worse.
- **language style:** the entire sentence uses a mocking and sarcastic tone, highlighting the disappointment and frustration felt due to tax deductions.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment indicates frustration and mockery regarding tax deductions. the use of the game show analogy and hashtags further underscores the sarcastic tone, contrasting the low-wage slip sentiment with the mocking phrase.

   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""

   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment might appear neutral or trivial. however, the context and way it's presented might imply that the speaker is trying to be ironic, suggesting that these stats are hardly anything to boast about. this implies the speaker may actually consider these stats unimpressive and is using irony to express an underwhelming sentiment.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the use of the term ""all nighter"" could suggest something demanding or tiring. the phrase ""#not"" at the end suggests negation or contradiction.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the phrase ""there's this thing called an all nighter"" and ""apparently i wanna pull one"" seem to depict an unwillingness or dread towards the idea of staying up all night. the use of ""#not"" signifies a sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker does not actually want to pull an all-nighter.

### step 3: compare and analyze surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** on the surface, it might initially seem like the person is stating they want to pull an all-nighter, but the use of ""#not"" immediately negates this, making it clear that the true intention is sarcasm.

- the language style is indirect, potentially implying sarcasm about the site's exposure or popularity.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (step 1) is neutral to slightly frustrated due to lack of explicit positive or negative sentiment.
- the true intention (step 2) leans towards implicitly sarcastic due to the context provided by hashtags and the emphasis on the site's lack of visibility.

        ","### step 1: identify surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be somewhat boastful or self-congratulatory, with the mention of travel accomplishments (""19 #us #states, 2 #canadian #provinces, & 11 #countries total""). the parenthetical statement ""(not the most, but not bad.)"" indicates a modest acknowledgment but still remains positive.

### step 2: deduce true intention
the phrase ""(not the most, but not bad.)"" can suggest a level of humility or downplaying the accomplishments, which might indicate a level of sarcasm, implying that the speaker thinks their achievements are actually quite impressive but are pretending otherwise. the context seems to mix a genuine claim with a subtle, playful tone.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of a modest boast balanced with the true intention of possibly downplaying through a humblebrag suggests a subtle sarcasm. the phrase ""not the most, but not bad."" adds a layer of irony as it's meant to understate the accomplishments.

   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

### step-by-step analysis:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment appears to be dismissive or indifferent, indicated by phrases like ""meh"" and ""nothing huge.""

2. **true intention:**
   - the true intention is unveiled by the advanced technology being described (a robot arm you can control with your mind), which is actually a significant breakthrough in science. the hashtags #sarcasm and #science further support that the statement is not to be taken at face value and that the speaker is using sarcasm to underscore the impressive nature of the technology.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the dismissive language (""meh. nothing huge."") and the remarkable subject matter (mind-controlled robot arm) clearly indicates sarcasm. the hashtags directly label the statement as sarcastic.

that awkward moment when you plane your whole day around your golf class, and it gets cancelled! #stupidrain

### steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be one of frustration or annoyance, indicated by the phrase ""gets cancelled"" and the hashtag ""#stupidrain."" the expression ""that awkward moment when"" usually sets up an expectation of disappointment or frustration.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence uses a popular structure ""that awkward moment when"" often utilized to highlight something unpleasant or ironic, in a light-hearted or humorous manner. the inclusion of sarcasm is underscored by the phrase ""plane your whole day around"" which exaggerates the disappointment, and the hashtag ""#stupidrain"" which personifies rain as being deliberately annoying.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the frustration and annoyance expressed on the surface align with the sarcastic exaggeration of planning the whole day around an event that gets canceled due to rain. the tone and structure suggest the intention to highlight the irony rather than just plain frustration.

Anybody using their rights to protest legally gets the law thrown at them. & the ones who do the crimes don't. That's #Irony #NotJustice,1,"
### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially does not exhibit a clear positive or negative sentiment. however, the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" is a strong clue towards sarcasm or a critical tone. 

step 2: true intention
the phrase ""a puppet at the #pti rally wanting to make #nayapakistan"" carries a critical undertone. the word ""puppet"" suggests that the individual is being manipulated or lacks genuine autonomy, while ""#nayapakistan"" (new pakistan) is a political slogan. given the context and the mention of ""#irony,"" it indicates that the speaker is doubtful or mocking the idea of real change or authenticity.

step 3: comparison and analysis
juxtaposing the surface sentiment (seemingly neutral) with the inferred underlying sentiment (critical or mocking), the use of ""#irony"" strongly suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the phrase ""i can't even begin to explain my frustration"" indicates a negative sentiment.
- the emoji 😒 commonly conveys displeasure, dissatisfaction, or frustration.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the phrase “i can't even begin to explain” is often used to intensify the expression of an emotion. 
- the combination of this phrase with the negative emotion of frustration and the 😒 emoji adds more weight to the expression.
- this overstated expression of frustration can often be indicative of sarcasm, where the speaker implies that their frustration is beyond explanation due to the situation being particularly exasperating or obvious in context.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is clearly negative.
- the true intention, considering the exaggerated expression and the use of the 😒 emoji, suggests that the speaker is employing sarcasm to emphasize the extent of their frustration.

- keywords and sentimental phrases: ""goes both ways,"" accompanied by hashtags #make #love #not #war #peace.
- indicates a positive sentiment by promoting love and peace.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""goes both ways"" can suggest duality or an equivocal stance, which could undercut the positivity suggested by the hashtags.
- language style: the statement appears straightforward and positive on the surface but the phrase ""goes both ways"" can be perceived as a somewhat neutral or indifferent remark.
- no explicit negative language, exaggeration, or irony that would clearly indicate sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- surface sentiment indicates positivity (promotion of love and peace).
- true intention remains close to surface sentiment but has a slight ambivalence due to ""goes both ways.""
- the slight ambiguity in ""goes both ways"" does not strongly indicate sarcasm on its own without additional negative context or irony.

### Example:
Input:
@harrys64 @dale_harris14 @rioferdy5 well done. you have more twitter followers than me. you have succeeded in life.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the keywords and phrases appear positive on the surface, such as ""well done,"" ""you have more twitter followers,"" and ""you have succeeded in life.""

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention can be detected through the use of exaggeration and possibly mocking language. the phrase ""you have succeeded in life"" is an exaggerated statement that implies having more twitter followers is a trivial achievement compared to true measures of success in life.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
by comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it becomes clear that the positive surface sentiment is not genuine. instead, it uses exaggeration and mock praise to ridicule the idea that having more followers equates to real success in life.

the keywords and phrases such as ""definitely how i wanted to start my day"" sound positive on the surface. however, the emoji (😒) and the hashtag (#not) introduce a negative sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention is to express dissatisfaction. the use of ""definitely"" and the phrase ""how i wanted to start my day"" create an exaggerated positive statement, but the accompanying emoji (😒) and the hashtag (#not) indicate the opposite sentiment, showing frustration or annoyance about fighting over chargers.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment seems positive at first, but it's contradicted by the emoji and hashtag, which show the speaker's true negative feelings. this stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intention demonstrates the use of sarcasm.

Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""most broke friends,"" ""fools,"" ""get a lil money,"" ""act uppity as ever""
- clues: the use of ""fools"" and ""uppity"" suggest contempt or disapproval. the contrast between ""most broke"" and ""get a lil money"" indicates a change in status or behavior that the author finds noteworthy.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the statement contrasts the past financial status of friends (""most broke"") with their current behavior (""act uppity as ever"").
- the word ""fools"" and the phrase ""want to act uppity"" indicate the author disapproves of their current behavior despite their newly improved financial status.
- the phrase ""get a lil money"" minimizes the financial improvement, contributing to the mocking tone.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of mild disappointment and resignation. key phrases include ""everybody's talking about snow"" and ""the only snow around is on our cars,"" indicating that the speaker is contrasting their expectation or desire for more significant snowfall with the reality of only seeing snow on cars. the use of hashtags ""#snow"" and ""#not"" adds to a more casual and conversational tone.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""everybody's talking about snow and i'm just sitting here"" followed by ""the only snow around is on our cars.. #not"" suggests the use of irony. the speaker is highlighting their expectation or desire for snow only to be met with disappointment, and the hashtag ""#not"" reinforces the irony in the situation. this suggests that the speaker is not just disappointed but also highlighting the contrast for a humorous effect.

both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate an underlying irony. the use of casual language and the contrast between expectation and reality, emphasized by the hashtags, point towards sarcasm. the speaker's expression of disappointment through exaggeration and irony indicates a sarcastic tone.

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment indicates a mix of seemingly positive support and tough love, but the irony is flagged explicitly with ""#sarcasm."" the true intention is to convey that the coach's notion of support is more about pushing the speaker hard, possibly going beyond what's perceived as supportive in a conventional sense.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears positive due to the phrase ""i love going to bed alone every night,"" where ""love"" is a positive verb.

### step 2: true intention
the inclusion of ""#not"" at the end of the sentence suggests a contradiction to the initial positive statement. the hashtag explicitly indicates that the speaker does not actually love going to bed alone every night. this is a clear marker of sarcasm, as the initial statement is deliberately contradicted.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention is negative, making the statement sarcastic. the use of ""#not"" is a direct indicator of sarcasm, reinforcing the opposite sentiment of the initial statement.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence appears to reflect a sense of amusement or indignation towards the person who tried stealing tools, indicated by the apparent irony and the use of the hashtag ""#irony"". the phrase ""mad cuz someone took his hot sauce"" also shows a sense of trivial frustration.

### step 2: true intention
the structure and word choice indicate sarcasm. the fact that the person who tried stealing tools is now upset over something relatively trivial (his hot sauce being taken) implies a sense of poetic justice. the use of ""#irony"" underscores the sarcastic nature of the statement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (amused or indignant) and the true intention (highlighting the ironic justice) align to create a sarcastic tone. the incongruity between the person's past actions and their current frustration enhances the sarcastic nature of the statement.

### Example:
Input:
guess its just me, brett and my mom this year. gotta love my family!

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""gotta love my family!""
- sentimental phrases: ""gotta love""

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears mixed but veers towards negative due to words like ""sucky"" and ""liar"", though there's an attempt at levity with ""lol"".

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony, hashtags
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence talks about seeing beauty in everything, including ""a liar"". this is possibly sarcastic given that finding beauty in dishonesty is unreasonable. hashtags and ""lol"" emphasize a mocking tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is mixed but not particularly positive.
- true intention is likely to convey frustration with a hint of sarcasm about trusting liars.

given the context of describing something as both ""sucky"" and involving a ""liar"" while using hashtags and ""lol"" to defuse the seriousness, it suggests sarcasm.

""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

This team would finish fourth. #Irony #Arsenal #Afc,1,"
### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""this team would finish fourth,"" ""#irony,"" ""#arsenal,"" ""#afc.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the hashtag ""#irony"" directly indicates that the statement might not be meant literally. the context of ""arsenal"" and ""afc"" refers to the football club, suggesting there might be a background of high expectations.

### true intention:
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the use of ""#irony"" suggests the statement is meant to highlight an unexpected or contradictory situation. given the reputations and expectations around a team like arsenal, the claim ""would finish fourth"" might imply disappointment, as it's below what fans might hope for, despite appearing to be a positive assertion.

### comparing surface sentiment and true intention:
- the surface statement sounds straightforward and neutral, suggesting an ordinary prediction.
- however, the use of ""#irony"" signals that the true intention is sarcastic, indicating that finishing fourth is seen as underachieving and thus highlighting a negative commentary on the team's performance.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""very well cleaned country road,"" ""tow truck,"" ""veered off,"" ""get sucked into ditch.""
- sentimental phrases: the situation described involves irony as indicated by the hashtag ""#irony.""

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: mentioning a ""very well cleaned country road"" but then describing a tow truck getting ""sucked into ditch"" employs irony.
- language style: the use of ""#irony"" explicitly suggests that the situation is contradictory or unexpected.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is ironic because the well-cleaned road contrasts with the tow truck getting into a ditch.
- the true intention is to highlight the absurdity of a tow truck, which is supposed to help with vehicle issues, itself getting stuck, emphasized by the hashtag ""#irony"".

""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the tweet appears negative based on keywords like ""do not like"" and the emphasis with capital letters and hashtags. the repetition of vowels in ""mondaiiis"" and ""fridaiis"" suggests a playful or stressed tone, indicating possible dissatisfaction.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be expressing dislike for weekdays without ""huweyyyyyy"" (possibly a person or thing the writer enjoys having around). the exaggeration in spelling and use of multiple vowels can be a sign of exaggeration or sarcasm rather than genuine distress.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is negative, suggesting dissatisfaction with weekdays without ""huweyyyyyy.""
- the style (exaggerated vowels and emphasis with hashtags) often indicates sarcasm. 
- the playful exacerbation and emphasis signal that the dissatisfaction might not be completely serious and is likely an exaggerated expression of a preference.

### step 2: true intention
- the statement mentions ""love it"" when someone else does a task they would normally do.
- the use of emojis could be interpreted as exaggeration, hinting at a sarcastic tone.
- the structure ""love it when"" in combination with a task usually considered tedious hints at a sarcastic intention.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment seems positive and appreciative.
- the true intention, deduced from the exaggeration in context, suggests sarcasm because people typically do not genuinely ""love"" it when others perform chores usually done by themselves; they often mean the opposite.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#justajoke"", which indicates that the statement is intended to be humorous and not taken seriously. additionally, it uses ""#not intodeadthings"" to clarify that the speaker is not actually engaging in or condoning necrophilia. the context of ""officially necrophelic"" following ""after today i'm"" creates an unusual and exaggerated statement.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker is exaggerating their situation by making an absurd and provocative statement ""officially necrophelic"" after a presumably difficult or intense latin final exam. this exaggeration is intended as hyperbolic humor, reinforced by ""#justajoke"" and ""#not intodeadthings"".

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment includes humor and clarification that the statement is a joke. by contrasting the absurdity of being ""officially necrophelic"" with the serious reality of taking a final exam and immediately clarifying it's a joke, the true intention emerges as sarcastic humor.

the surface sentiment appears to express discontent and criticism, particularly toward perceived inequality. this is indicated by the phrase ""equal justice for all...unless you are black during the obama administration,"" which suggests a critique of a lack of equal justice.

### step 2: true intention
the mention of ""equal justice for all"" followed by ""unless you are black during the obama administration"" employs irony and sarcasm. the phrase appears to mock the notion of equal justice by highlighting alleged racial inequalities. the source, ""via @foxnewspolitics,"" might further imply a critical or oppositional stance, often using sarcasm.

- mentioning the call is related to a form filled out three months ago indicates a sense of annoyance or frustration.
- the phrase ""just what i need an hour before we head off to disneyland"" implies that the call is unwelcome and poorly timed.
- the hashtag ""#not"" explicitly indicates sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment appears neutral but upon deeper inspection, the actual sentiment conveyed through the use of quotation marks, specific phrasing, and the hashtag points to sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""i like listening to dads truck drivers tell me about them going to the strip joint and their old lady getting mad at them over it :face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**

- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is sharply contrasted by the actual content (which implies annoyance or discomfort), indicating sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be positive due to the words ""brand new ps4."" however, this is immediately contrasted with negative phrases such as ""faulty security"" and hashtags like ""#goodjob"" and ""#not.""

### step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be critical. the hashtags ""#goodjob"" and ""#not"" are clear indicators of sarcasm. they imply that the speaker is not literally praising the security but rather expressing frustration or dissatisfaction with it.

### step 3: compare and analysis
the surface sentiment tries to portray a neutral or slightly positive view with the mention of a ""brand new ps4,"" but the true intention, revealed through the context and sarcastic hashtags, is clearly negative and critical. the discrepancy suggests sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

explanation:

step 1: the surface sentiment suggests an ironic or humorous tone. 
- keywords like ""most of us didn't focus"" and the hashtag #adhd imply that it's a common and expected issue, especially given the nature of adhd, but the additional hashtag #irony highlights that it is being pointed out humorously.

step 2: the true intention here is not genuinely to inform but to humorously highlight the expected contradiction that people with adhd struggle to focus during an adhd lecture. the use of #irony underscores this intention.

step 3: the surface sentiment suggests humor, and the true intention aligns with pointing out a situational irony. the explicit use of #irony further solidifies this as a sarcastic or ironic statement.

thus, the label is: sarcastic.",1

### Example:
Input:
""giving 200 cr. water subsidy to 'public' is a crime & wasting 200 cr. on advertisement is development...waah ji waah http://t.co/q6xoguml9t""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.
- the critical tone and use of ""waah ji waah"" sarcastically to highlight the absurdity suggest sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""a t1t in public,"" ""doesn't agree"" 
- clues: the use of the word ""t1t"" is derogatory and indicates negative sentiment.
- additional indicators: the hashtag ""#irony"" suggests the tweet is highlighting a situation that is contrary to what would be expected, which can be a hint towards sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the tweet seems to be pointing out the hypocrisy of farage. the use of ""a t1t in public"" (an insult) and ""doesn't agree with seeing t1ts in public"" suggests that the author is mocking farage for having a double standard regarding public decency.
- the hashtag ""#irony"" reinforces the notion that the situation described is ironic and thus points towards sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: the tweet appears negative and mocking.
- true intention: the hashtag ""#irony"" and the context suggest the author is sarcastically highlighting farage's hypocrisy.
- considering the clues and the true intention, the tweet is intended to be sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: identify surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment appears defensive and indignant, marked by the phrase ""how dare you accuse me,"" which typically expresses offense or affront. no sentimental phrases or emojis suggest a humorous or exaggerated tone.

step 2: deduce true intention:
the language style does not contain exaggerated praise, irony, or humor typically associated with sarcasm. the direct confrontation ""how dare you"" signals genuine indignation and a straightforward response to an accusation.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

the surface sentiment appears positive. the phrase “gotta love my family!” typically expresses affection and gratitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony
- language style: casual, familiar tone

the sentence states, ""guess it's just me, brett, and my mom this year,"" suggesting a small, potentially disappointing gathering. given the context, ""gotta love my family!"" likely carries an ironic tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive.
- true intention is likely frustration or disappointment.

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""my favorite thing""
- sentimental phrases: none

the surface sentiment appears positive at first due to the phrase ""my favorite thing.""

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: irony, sarcasm
- language style: casual, complaining

the sentence immediately contradicts itself with complaints about waking up early, driving in the snow, and disliking someone (""this bitch ass""), showing that the initial sentiment is not genuine.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment is positive (""my favorite thing"").
- true intention is negative (irony and complaining about waking up early and driving in the snow).

the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""oh look at me! i'm making people happy! i'm a magical man from happy land! who lives in a gumdrop house on lolly pop lane!""

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

        ","### response:

step 1: **surface sentiment:**
- the surface sentiment of the text is neutral to negative. the phrase ""the elections are not over zero vat"" suggests some sort of political dissatisfaction or critique.

step 2: **true intention:**
- the use of the phrases ""not over zero vat"" and ""whether there will be a zionist or extremist country"" indicates a more serious and critical statement about the nature of the elections. the mention of ""zionist or extremist country"" introduces a controversial and heightened rhetoric, which often implies that the speaker is critiquing or making a pointed observation about the political situation.

step 3: **comparison and analysis:**
- the contrast between the somewhat neutral phrase about vat and the loaded terms ""zionist or extremist country"" implies that the speaker is using irony or exaggeration to criticize the stakes or the nature of the election. given the heightened and loaded language, there is a strong indication of irony here, suggesting a sardonic intention.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the hashtag ""#irony"" signals an ironic tone. the discussion of physical traits being fake and achievements on paypal versus conventional platinum rankings infers criticism and mockery.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the statement uses irony as a rhetorical device. it highlights the contradiction between lil kim calling someone ""plastic"" and the fact that the accuser, k. michelle, has a significant amount of silicone in her body. additionally, pointing out the disparity in professional achievements with a twist on ""paypal platinum"" versus conventional music industry platinum further emphasizes the irony and mocking intent.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment is critical and mocking. the true intention is to point out the absurdity and hypocrisy in k. michelle's statement about lil kim. the use of ""#irony"" confirms the sarcastic tone intended by the speaker.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""

   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

the surface sentiment is one of surprise or confusion indicated by the use of capital letters (""that"") and the exclamation mark (""?!"").

### step 2: true intention

the true intention can be more difficult to pinpoint without additional context. however, the expression ""where did that come from?!"" strongly implies that the speaker finds something unexpected or out of the ordinary. this phrase is often used in a sarcastic manner to mock or express disbelief.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

comparing both steps, the phrase contains elements that can suggest sarcasm—capitalization and an exclamation mark can indicate a heightened, exaggerated reaction. given this, the surprise might not be genuine but rather an expression of sarcasm.

the phrases ""somebody has filled my head with snot"" and ""used a cheese grater on the back of my throat"" employ hyperbole. these exaggerated descriptions hint at sarcasm. the hashtag ""#unimpressed"" reinforces the notion that the person is making light of their discomfort rather than expressing genuine, straightforward suffering.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of discomfort and frustration is conveyed through highly exaggerated and humorous language, indicating that the true intention is to sarcastically describe their unpleasant experience.

        ","### step 1: identify surface sentiment
the surface sentiment in the tweet appears to have mixed emotions. the initial part, ""i am downloading #advancedwarfare now!!"" shows excitement and anticipation, indicated by the exclamation marks. however, this excitement is followed by a sense of disappointment or frustration, shown by ""can't play it until 22nd of december tho :/"" and the sad emoji "":/"".

### step 2: deduce true intention
the sentence juxtaposes an initial excitement with a subsequent disappointment, suggesting there is an underlying sentiment of frustration. the excitement about downloading the game is undermined by the fact that the person cannot play it until later due to exams.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the true intention appears to contrast the initial excitement with the resulting frustration. this juxtaposition and the sad emoji indicate a tone that may be sarcastic, as the person is highlighting the futility of their excitement due to the exams.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the tweet appears to express criticism or frustration. the phrase ""we could just kill their kids in a drone strike"" is highly negative and homicidal. the use of ""that strategy seems to b working so well"" could imply dissatisfaction or irony, and the hashtag ""#not"" (often used sarcastically) further indicates sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be criticizing or mocking the effectiveness of using drone strikes as a strategy. the phrase ""seems to b working so well"" followed by ""#not"" suggests the author believes the strategy is not working at all and uses sarcasm to highlight its perceived failure.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows anger and frustration. the use of #not confirms that the author is not serious and is using sarcasm to criticize the strategy they mentioned.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative, with phrases such as ""now i hate my brother even more."" it gives the impression of strong dislike and resentment towards the brother.

### step 2: true intention
upon closely examining the language and hashtags like #jk (just kidding), #not, #stilljk (still just kidding), and the context of informal speech, the true intention seems to suggest that the statement is not to be taken literally. these hashtags indicate that the sentiment might not be genuine and is instead meant to be humorous or sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment suggests strong feelings of dislike, but the inclusion of multiple hashtags indicating that the speaker is ""just kidding"" implies that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically or humorously. therefore, the true intention contrasts with the surface sentiment.

- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.

- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

the surface sentiment of condescension and dismissal aligns with the presence of sarcasm in the statement. the winking emoji reinforces the ironic tone.

@KaylaBattaglia thanks I thought it was tomorrow #not #iknow #notthepoint,1,"
### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

the sentiment appears positive when taken at face value. phrases like ""and why wouldn't you be"" and ""after that performance!"" suggest approval or admiration.

### step 2: true intention
the use of uppercase ""that performance!"" and the phrase ""and why wouldn't you be"" create a tone that could imply something unexpected or contrary to the literal surface reading. this stylistic choice often indicates sarcasm, as it implies the performance might have been exceptionally poor rather than good.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment seems positive, but the true intention likely flips this on its head. by using exaggeration and a tone that suggests surprise or incredulity, the statement sarcastically implies the opposite of what it says on the surface.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

### step-by-step analysis:

- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to informative, but the use of ""#irony"" suggests a certain layering of meaning beyond the straightforward description.

#### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the key to understanding the true intention is the hashtag ""#irony."" the sentence speaks about someone exaggerating the claims of a study about pr exaggerating the claims of scientific studies. this recursive idea of exaggeration is meant to be humorous and points out the irony in the situation. the hashtag explicitly states that irony is present, which often goes hand-in-hand with sarcasm.

#### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is neutral or informative, but the hashtag ""#irony"" and the recursive concept indicate the poster is highlighting something absurd or hypocritical. the presence of irony often signals sarcasm. therefore, the true intention is likely sarcastic, as the use of irony in this context suggests a critique or mocking tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and sentimental phrases**: ""can i just own an isle far away from here,"" ""where my house is stunningly beautiful"", ""only some closed ppl who appreciates me as a human""
- **emotional tone**: longing, wistfulness, desire for escape

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: use of hyperbolic desire for an unrealistic scenario (owning an island, having a stunningly beautiful house, only being with people who appreciate them).
- **language style**: the elaborate and exaggerated description suggests a more nuanced sentiment likely pointing to dissatisfaction or frustration with current circumstances rather than genuine expectation of the described scenario.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment indicates a wishful thinking or longing for a better place and situation.
- the true intention reveals that this exaggerated wish suggests dissatisfaction, possibly indicating a sarcastic comment on the improbability of such an ideal situation happening.

### Example:
Input: am really fuckin paying for it today #tequila #is  #the #one

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** 
   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.
   - **emojis:** none present.

2. **true intention deduction:** 
   - **rhetorical devices/language style:** the hyperbolic and straightforward style does not contain irony or opposite meanings. it suggests genuine regret or discomfort, likely due to the aftermath of drinking tequila.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - both the surface sentiment (regret/discomfort) and the true intention (regret/discomfort due to drinking) align directly. the expression lacks the contrast typically associated with sarcasm, where one says something but means the opposite.

- **keywords:** ""if only i could be a cooler kid"", ""xp"", ""lol"", ""i'm such a nerd""
- **hashtags:** #can, #i, #know, #when, #im, #not, #gonna, #get, #rejected
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrases ""if only i could be a cooler kid"", ""lol"", and ""i'm such a nerd"" suggest a self-deprecating tone.
- **emojis:** none present, but ""xp"" and ""lol"" function similarly to emojis to convey a teasing or playful tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""if only i could be a cooler kid"" uses irony, as the person likely doesn't actually believe they can be cool, and this contrasts with their label of themselves as a ""nerd"" who gets ""rejected"". the use of ""lol"" and ""xp"" suggests a humorous or mocking self-reflection. the hashtags are somewhat random but emphasize the feeling of rejection.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (self-deprecation and mockery) matches the true intention (making fun of one's own lack of coolness and frequent rejection). the use of irony and self-mockery in the surface sentiment indicates sarcasm since the speaker doesn't genuinely believe that they will become a cooler kid.

- language style: the phrase suggests the speaker is criticizing or making fun of someone related to sarah palin, using the idea of ""protecting"" sarcastically.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment seems positive with the word ""protecting.""
- true intention, determined by the derogatory term ""palinspawn,"" indicates a mocking and critical tone.

- sentimental phrases or markers: the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates a sarcastic tone.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""it's so the speaker remembers their talk's over"" logically implies that speakers would naturally remember when their talk is over. the statement mockingly suggests the need for an obvious reminder, employing irony.
- language style: by questioning ""how would they know?"" the speaker uses a rhetorical question to emphasize the absurdity of the statement, which contributes to the sarcastic tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment appears somewhat earnest about ensuring speakers remember the end of their talk.
- true intention, as indicated by the explicit tag ""#sarcasm"" and the use of rhetorical questions, reveals that the original statement is not meant to be taken seriously but is instead mocking the redundancy of such a reminder.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- rhetorical device: the phrase ""it's a jolly day for news today"" is an obvious exaggeration given the grim events listed.
- the use of ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates the tweet is not genuinely expressing positive sentiment.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment presents a stark contrast between the tragic news events and the phrase ""jolly day,"" clearly indicating insincerity.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the context is that the user is discussing losing money (""fiver"") and acknowledging forrest in a way that would not genuinely be positive given the loss.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** while the surface sentiment appears positive due to ""cheers forrest :)"", the true intent is clearly negative because losing a fiver is not a situation where one would genuinely feel like expressing gratitude with a smiley face. the mismatch between the sad reality of losing money and the positive-sounding ""cheers"" alongside a smiley face suggests sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be positive, indicated by the phrase ""so glad"" and the use of the raising hand emoji (🙋), which generally conveys happiness or relief.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
to determine true intention, we need to consider context or tone that could suggest sarcasm. the expression ""so glad"" in combination with the emoji could be genuine, but in different contexts, it could also imply the opposite sentiment, particularly if the speaker is actually dissatisfied about something related to their work schedule.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the potential for sarcasm lies in the contrast between the likely negative experience of work and the surface-level positive expression about being off work. without additional context, such as whether the speaker actually dislikes their job or simply feels relieved, the overall tone seems sarcastic due to the often stressful and displeasing nature of work, and the exaggerated expression of being ""so glad"" to be off work.

the surface sentiment of nostalgia and positivity aligns with the true intention of reminiscing about good times. there is no discrepancy between the apparent emotion and the underlying purpose.

Please snow let us get out of dance early,0,"
### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""please"" usually indicates politeness or a genuine request.
- **sentimental indicators:** requesting to get out early from a commitment (dance) might indicate a desire for relief or freedom, but without additional context, it sounds like a simple request.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the request for snow to help them get out of dance early may indicate an expectation that snow will cause an event to be canceled. this reveals an underlying desire to avoid the dance.
- **language style:** the phrase “please snow” can indicate a wish or plea that's unlikely to be fulfilled, hinting at an ironic tone. typically, people don't direct requests to weather phenomena, implying the speaker's frustration or exaggeration.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** while the surface sentiment is a polite request, the underlying desire and the nature of the request (asking for snow as an excuse) suggest a sarcastic undertone. the true intent contrasts with the polite phrasing, indicating the actual feeling is one of wanting to avoid the dance, perhaps with resignation or cynicism.

Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

why is there evidence of a stripper in my house yet i see no stripper in my house 😑💔 http://t.co/2kjus8rota

### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses emojis 😑 (annoyed) and 💔 (heartbroken) which typically indicate negative emotions. the phrase ""evidence of a stripper in my house yet i see no stripper"" also suggests confusion or frustration.

#### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to convey a sense of irony or disbelief, stating the unexpected situation of finding evidence of a stripper without any actual stripper being present. this is a classic setup for sarcasm, pointing out the absurdity of the situation.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment shows negative emotions and confusion, while the true intention reveals a sarcastic take on the absurdity of the situation. both indicate a sarcastic tone due to the nature of the unlikely scenario and the use of sarcasm to express disbelief or frustration.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the content of the sentence involves truck drivers talking about visiting strip joints and their wives getting angry, which is typically not something people genuinely enjoy hearing about.
- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

- the phrase ""how can u miss something u never had?"" poses a rhetorical question. the use of hashtags like #randomthoughts and #miss provide a casual tone and could be interpreted straightforwardly as a reflection or genuine question.
  
### step 2: true intention
- evaluating the sentence closely, the rhetorical question ""how can you miss something you never had?"" suggests irony because it implies that missing something necessitates having had it first. the sentiment expressed here seems to challenge the notion of missing something that one has never experienced, which is inherently contradictory.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment has elements of both contemplation and irony, but the rhetorical structure of the question and the tag #irony together indicate a more complex, ironic undertone, pointing towards a sarcastic intent.

Input:

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

the sentence includes phrases like ""godfathers of asian values"" and ""malaysians are 'stupid'"", which could be seen as contradictory given the esteem usually associated with being a ""godfather"" of values.

### step 2: true intention
the use of the word ""irony"" and the contradictory nature of the statements suggest that the tweet is pointing out a disparity between mahathir's esteemed position and the negative statement about malaysians not knowing how to run an airline. this suggests that the tweet may not be straightforward but rather critical and mocking.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface keywords appear positive and negative, but the true intention, highlighted by the word ""irony,"" suggests a criticism of mahathir and possibly the statement's logical inconsistency. therefore, the sentence is likely employing sarcasm to make its point.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment:** surprise and disbelief at the popularity of wwe wrestling.

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment is negative. phrases like ""that's some bullshit"" and ""a complete rip off"" indicate strong disapproval. the use of ""#not"" further emphasizes a negative sentiment.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence is a direct expression of dissatisfaction and criticism regarding the items' prices. the hashtag ""#not"" suggests that the speaker believes others might mistakenly think it’s a good sale, adding an element of ridicule towards those people.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment is strongly negative and aligns with the true intention of criticizing the prices and mocking those who think it's a good sale. there is no positive surface sentiment being contradicted here to suggest sarcasm.

Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment in the sentence appears to be neutral and contemplative. there are no keywords or sentimental phrases indicating strong emotions. the language is straightforward, offering a choice between being right and being happy.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the sentence uses a rhetorical question to juxtapose two concepts: being right and being happy. this kind of phrasing often implies that there is a significant difference between the two options, suggesting that prioritizing one might come at the expense of the other. the use of an either/or structure can sometimes imply that pursuing one goal might inherently limit the other, which can carry a subtle implication of irony or sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is neutral, but the rhetorical device of an either/or question that contrasts being right with being happy suggests a subtle critique or irony. the intention might be to highlight the frequent incompatibility of these two goals in a humorous or sarcastic way.

### Example:
Input:
""oh look at me! i'm making people happy! i'm a magical man from happy land! who lives in a gumdrop house on lolly pop lane!""

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the speaker is highlighting the contradiction between their initial desire to escape materialism and their current engagement in a highly materialistic activity (xmas shopping). the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" reinforces that the speaker finds this situation ironic or sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear contrast between the surface sentiment (expressed happiness about escaping materialism) and the true intention (pointing out the irony of ending up xmas shopping in a similar materialistic context). this contradiction indicates that the speaker is being sarcastic.

- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""not so ugly"" employs a form of litotes (understatement) to possibly highlight how the sweater is actually appreciated in some unique way.

- **language style:** although mary j. blige mentions flaws (""not perfect""), there's an underlying affirmation of self-worth and recognition of beauty. the use of ""#not #perfet"" could potentially be a typo, enhancing the authenticity of her humility.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be enthusiastic and positive. the phrase ""lets gooooo!"" expresses excitement. the inclusion of hashtags like #school, #sarcasm, and #swag further highlights an overly enthusiastic tone.

### step 2: true intention
despite the surface enthusiasm, the true intention is likely negative. the phrase ""i have three exams today"" combined with expressing excitement is illogical because most people dread having multiple exams in a single day. the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates that the excitement is not genuine.

### step 3: compare and analysis
the surface sentiment is positive and enthusiastic based on the language used. however, given the context of dreading multiple exams and the explicit use of #sarcasm, the true sentiment is negative. this discrepancy clearly points to sarcasm.

- language style: the language is clear and to the point, saying it was a ""very good day."" in the absence of additional context, this would typically be interpreted literally.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- surface sentiment suggests a positive experience (very good day).
- true intention appears to align with the surface sentiment, as there are no indications of sarcasm without additional context.

Welll helllo fever. Id say 103 is feelin real good today #not,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to be expressing a negative sentiment due to the phrase ""helllo fever"" and the number ""103"" suggesting a high fever, which is typically associated with discomfort. additionally, the hashtag ""#not"" at the end is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention can be inferred from the exaggerated tone and the use of ""welll helllo"" and ""feelin real good today."" these phrases often sarcastically imply the opposite of what is being stated. given that a fever of 103 degrees is quite high and uncomfortable, the speaker is most likely trying to convey that they are feeling very bad, not good.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
by comparing the surface sentiment (negative) with the inferred underlying sentiment (sarcastically negative), it's clear that the incongruity between the stated (superficially positive due to ""feelin real good today"") and the actual meaning (very bad due to the high fever and discomfort) indicates sarcasm.

the true intention is to criticize ""planned parenthood"" by pointing out the perceived contradiction in its name. the use of ""#irony"" and ""#oxymoron"" explicitly signals that the writer believes there is something contradictory or misleading about the name. the quotes around ""planned parenthood"" also add emphasis to the skepticism or negativity towards the organization.

the phrase ""who said that birthday girl can't celebrate the next day???"" suggests a challenge to a potential social norm or rule. combined with the celebratory tone and context, it implies that the speaker feels unrestricted by such a norm and is justifying their choice to continue celebrating. there doesn't seem to be any rhetorical device indicating sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the cheerful and celebratory surface sentiment aligns with the underlying intention of justifying continued celebration. no discrepancy between the surface sentiment and true intention suggests that there is no sarcasm involved.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment

- keywords and sentimental phrases: 
  - ""it was a great show"" - positive sentiment.
  - ""ending of the tlc match was fubar"" - negative sentiment (fubar indicates something is messed up).
  - ""the stairs match was terrible"" - negative sentiment.
- overall mixed sentiment with both positive and negative aspects.

### step 2: true intention

- rhetorical devices:
  - ""it was a great show"" followed by negative criticism might imply contradiction.
  - ""fubar"" and ""terrible"" are strong negative descriptors used immediately after a positive statement.
- language style:
  - the phrase structure indicates a positive statement followed by strong negative criticism, commonly used to set up sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze

- the initial surface sentiment of ""it was a great show"" does not match the subsequent strong negative sentiment, suggesting use of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style indicates a possible use of sarcasm due to the emotional intensity of ""ahhhhhh"" and the fragmented hashtag style. the statement ""you think i'm crazy"" could be taken literally or as a sarcastic retort to someone implying that the speaker is crazy.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

the surface sentiment appears to be contemplative and somewhat frustrated. phrases like ""trying to eat crackers on the quiet floor"" and ""maybe if i chew slower no one will notice"" suggest an attempt to remain unnoticed and a sense of resignation.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention is revealed by the final part of the text: ""#not."" this hashtag negates the effort described in the earlier part of the sentence and indicates that the speaker is aware that the attempt to chew quietly is futile.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the use of ""#not"" clearly flips the sentiment. despite the initial effort to be quiet and respectful, the speaker is highlighting the impracticality and perhaps the absurdity of trying to eat crackers quietly on a very quiet floor. the contrast between the effort described and the negation indicates sarcasm.

the surface sentiment of the tweet isn't immediately clear through keywords alone, but there's a sense of finality with the phrase ""and then there were none."" this could suggest a conclusion or an ending.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to revolve around the context of the #celtics and might be referencing a scenario where a significant change has happened (e.g., the team losing players or being eliminated from competition). the phrase ""and then there were none"" is a well-known idiom and literary reference that usually implies everything or everyone is gone, which can be used sarcastically to express disappointment or disbelief at a situation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is ambiguous but leans towards a negative or final sentiment.
- the true intention, given the context and idiomatic expression, suggests sarcasm with a tone of disappointment or critique.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.

step 1: identify surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment appears accusatory and outraged, with phrases like ""blood of those cops on their hands"" indicating a serious and condemning tone. the phrase ""no doubt"" adds emphasis to the certainty of the accusation.

step 2: deduce true intention:
the statement assigns blame to multiple high-profile figures and the media for a serious incident, suggesting a critical perspective. however, the certainty and sweeping nature of the accusation (""no doubt"") often indicates a sarcastic undertone, given the improbability of such direct responsibility being literally true. the list of figures suggests an underlying critique of their perceived influence.

step 3: compare and analyze:
while the surface sentiment is accusatory and serious, the exaggerated certainty (""no doubt"") and the list of high-profile figures suggest the use of sarcasm to convey skepticism and criticism of those being accused rather than a literal direct blame.

        ","### step 1: identify surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of the sentence ""it's always the little things that's attracts me"" seems positive and appreciative. the phrase ""always the little things"" suggests an appreciation for the small, perhaps unnoticed details, and ""attracts me"" indicates a sense of allure or charm.

### step 2: deduce true intention
however, there can be an element of sarcasm when someone says ""it's always the little things"" if it's said in a context where the 'little things' are petty annoyances or minor yet unwanted issues. without additional context, it is difficult to ascertain if the speaker genuinely means appreciation or is instead being ironic about minor irritants.

### step 3: compare and analyze
comparing the surface sentiment and the potential true intention:
- if someone genuinely appreciates the small things, the statement remains straightforwardly positive and not sarcastic.
- if someone is emphasizing ""always the little things"" to highlight minor yet significant annoyances, the statement could be sarcastic.

given the ambiguity and without further context to indicate clear sarcasm:

"@ManUtdstholder @hunts9 You're #not familiar #with Matt Busby, #then. Lol.",0,"
### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **sentimental indicators:** the phrase ""lol"" often signifies laughter, which can sometimes indicate amusement or mockery.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""you're #not familiar #with matt busby, #then."" combined with ""lol"" suggests that the speaker finds it amusing or surprising that the other person is not familiar with a well-known figure (matt busby).
- **language style:** the use of ""lol"" at the end and the inclusion of hashtags in unusual places can suggest a sarcastic or mocking tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment might seem informative or neutral at first glance, but the inclusion of ""lol"" and the unusual use of hashtags suggest the real intention is to mock or ridicule the other person's lack of familiarity with matt busby. there is a stark contrast between the surface expression and the implied true intention, indicating sarcasm.

Highly inflamed stomach is just what I like #not,1,"
### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to contain both positive and negative indicators. the phrase ""highly inflamed stomach is just what i like"" seems oddly positive considering the unpleasant reality of an inflamed stomach, and it's juxtaposed with the hashtag ""#not,"" which is a common indicator of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the sentence uses the phrase ""just what i like,"" which normally suggests a preference or enjoyment. however, the hashtag ""#not"" negates this statement and indicates that the speaker does not actually enjoy or like having an inflamed stomach. this contradiction reveals the speaker's true intention, which is to express displeasure or frustration sarcastically.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it becomes clear that the sentence is designed to sarcastically indicate a strong dislike for having an inflamed stomach. the positive phrase is immediately negated by the sarcastic hashtag, clarifying the speaker's true feeling.

   - **keywords:** ""am really fuckin paying for it today""
   - **hashtags:** #tequila, #is, #the, #one
   - **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""really fuckin paying for it"" suggests a negative or regretful sentiment.

2. **true intention deduction:**

- **indicates:** overwhelmed, on the brink of giving up, but with a hint of resilience.
- **hashtags:** the use of multiple hashtags joined by `#` instead of spaces could suggest a social media post where the speaker is trying to emphasize their multitude of sentiments in a single breath.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""not usually a quitter"" paired with ""can do no more"" suggests a contradiction between the speaker's usual persistence and their current state, potentially signaling frustration or exhaustion.
- **language style:**
    - the use of hashtags could be seen as a way to dramatize their statement and grab attention.
    - exaggeration in ""only so much can be thrown at me!"" could be dramatic, indicating a high threshold that has been surpassed.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment indicates a feeling of being overwhelmed and exhausted but with a slight undertone of resilience.
- the true intention reveals that the speaker is generally not a quitter and they are feeling the pressure to their limits, but the phrasing and dramatic hashtags suggest they might be employing hyperbole to emphasize their point.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
despite the neutral appearance, the phrase ""#not insured"" could be interpreted as an expression of frustration or dissatisfaction, since the hashtag suggests a context where insurance would be expected or desired. the brevity and context of the statement hint at an implicit critique or lament about not having insurance.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment of neutrality contrasts with the potential underlying dissatisfaction or criticism implied by using the hashtag. the terse and ironic presentation with a hashtag indicates a likely sarcastic undertone, as it's a common strategy to imply criticism or disappointment.

- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""

### step 2: true intention

- the user seems to be expressing relief that the cold is not full blown (""thankfully not full cold"").
- the statement ""just one side down"" suggests partial discomfort but not a severe one.
- the term ""full vitamin netty pot combo blast"" indicates a mixture of treatments being used, suggesting a proactive approach to wellness.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- surface sentiment: mostly positive or neutral, expressing mild relief and proactive measures.
- true intention: aligns with the surface sentiment. there are no clear indicators of sarcasm such as contradictory terms, exaggeration, or unexpected context.

### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **sentimental phrases and hashtags:** the phrase ""i do hope you sleep better"" might sound positive in isolation, but ""sabotaging charities"" and the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" introduce a clear negative connotation, suggesting disapproval and mockery.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" is a direct indication of the sarcastic intent. the structure of the sentence is intended to highlight the absurdity and reprehensibility of the actions of ""anti #gamergate'rs"" for ""sabotaging charities."" the irony lies in contrasting the stated hope that these individuals sleep better with the morally negative action (sabotaging charities) that supposedly leads to respectability.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment might initially appear as concern or hope (""i do hope you sleep better""), but the directives in the sentence (""knowing that sabotaging charities would make you more respectable in society"") and the explicit ""#sarcasm"" reveal the true intention. it is evident that the speaker finds the actions morally wrong and is using sarcasm to criticize.

the sentiment appears light-hearted and humorous, as evidenced by the ""haha"" at the beginning. key phrases include ""guess my tweet was ok then"" and the inquiry ""are you back in training @charliejnwalker,"" which suggest a casual, friendly tone.

### step 2: true intention
upon examining the language, there seems to be a hint of modesty or downplaying of the tweet's quality with ""guess my tweet was ok then."" the inclusion of ""haha"" suggests a joking or self-effacing manner, which could be interpreted as sarcasm. the follow-up question about training appears straightforward.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing both steps, the initial humorous tone and the modesty of the statement ""guess my tweet was ok then"" do hint at a subtle level of sarcasm, implying that the speaker may actually think their tweet was more than just ""ok.""

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- sentimental phrases: ""crime,"" ""development""
- clues: the use of capitalization in ""crime"" and ""development"" suggest strong emotions.
- sarcastic indicators: the interjection ""waah ji waah"" typically implies admiration or amazement, but here it is used in a context that contradicts the sentiments expressed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement juxtaposes the government's allocation of resources: a subsidy considered a ""crime"" versus spending on advertisement labeled as ""development.""
- the use of contrasting terms alongside a rhetorical device (juxtaposition) indicates criticism.
- the interjection ""waah ji waah"" is used sarcastically to underscore the perceived absurdity of the contrasting actions.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: seems admiring but context indicates criticism.
- true intention: clearly, the author's intent is to criticize the allocation of funds.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses a negative emoji 😒, and the hashtag #irony suggests a mocking or sarcastic tone. phrases like ""the thirstiest of thirst buckets"" also hint at a critical sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""the thirstiest of thirst buckets calling other people thirsty"" implies a situation where someone who is very needy or desperate (a ""thirst bucket"") is hypocritically accusing others of the same behavior. the expression combined with the hashtag #irony indicates that the speaker finds this behavior ridiculous and is mocking it.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is negative, but the true intention is to highlight hypocrisy in a mocking way. the discrepancy and exaggerated criticism suggest that the statement is sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
- sailing-|×|#me #selfie #ootd  #cool  #cute #girl #tumblr #black #style #rock #punk #vsco... http://t.co/sdn3w9kqvk

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment remains positive and consistent with typical social media posts. no contradictory elements suggest sarcasm. therefore, both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a genuine, non-sarcastic context.

- the post includes hashtags such as #pantsdowntiggy, #moot, and #irony. the hashtag #irony is a significant clue that there might be an underlying sarcastic tone. the phrase ""pixelation #moot or #irony"" adds to the potential for sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the language style here is less straightforward and more playful. the use of irony explicitly suggests that the user might be employing sarcasm. the context of a ""crime"" and the whimsical hashtag #pantsdowntiggy, along with the mention of ""pixelation"" and ""irony,"" suggest that the user is not being serious and is likely making a humorous or sarcastic comment.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- both the surface sentiment and the intended meaning seem to align towards sarcasm. the explicit use of the hashtag #irony and the playful tone of the post indicate that the user is likely being sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the sentence includes ""love the fact that i turned off my alarm this morning and slept till so freaking late"", which seems to indicate a positive feeling about sleeping in. however, it ends with the hashtag ""#not"", a common way to imply the opposite of what was previously stated.

### step 2: true intention
the use of ""#not"" at the end explicitly suggests that the speaker does not actually love the fact that they turned off their alarm and slept in late. the sentence is meant to be understood in the opposite way, making it clear that the speaker is unhappy about oversleeping.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the initial positive sentiment and the subsequent negation with ""#not"" reveal a contradiction that characterizes sarcasm. the true intention is to mock or criticize the reality of oversleeping, rather than celebrating it.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to express a mix of mild frustration and humor. it mentions girls not answering their phone and it includes the hashtag ""#irony"", which often hints at a discrepancy between reality and expectation.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the sentence seems to imply that the speaker is frustrated by the girls' misunderstanding of his intentions—he calls them but they do not answer because they think he is going to call them in early, while he actually intends to cut them some slack.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
by comparing the surface sentiment (a mix of frustration and humor) with the inferred underlying sentiment (frustration due to misunderstanding, included with a hashtag indicating irony), it can be inferred that the statement is sarcastic. the speaker is using irony to highlight the inherent contradiction between his intentions and the girls' assumptions.

### Example:
Input: 
those were some great last minute substitutions @tomcrean

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: on the surface, the sentence appears to be positive. the phrase ""great last minute substitutions"" suggests a compliment or approval of the action.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: the surface sentiment appears to have a negative tone. the phrase ""make sure you don't say christmas!!"" implies a critique, and the hashtags ""#sarcasm"" and ""#itisachristmastree"" give a strong clue.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the explicit hashtag ""#sarcasm"", the tweet is clearly sarcastic. the true intention behind the message criticizes what is perceived as an over-cautious approach to avoiding the term ""christmas,"" implying that it is overly political or nonsensical since the decorations are for a christmas tree.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface indicated negativity, and the true intention was also negative but expressed through sarcasm to criticize the situation. the explicit use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" directly signals to the reader that the message is sarcastic.

Rolled out of bed for closing.... #ilookreallygood #not,1,"
### Example:
Input:
listening to a guy who decimated his team explaining to another how to build teams... hahahahaha aaaah.  #tragedy

Steps:
**step 1: assessing the surface sentiment**
- **keywords/phrases:** ""decimated his team,"" ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" ""hahahahaha aaaah,"" ""#tragedy.""
- **sentimental phrases and emojis:** the laughter indicated by ""hahahahaha"" might seem positive, but the term ""decimated his team"" and the hashtag ""#tragedy"" introduce a negative connotation.

**step 2: deducing the true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** there's clear use of irony here. the phrase ""decimated his team"" starkly contrasts with the role of ""explaining to another how to build teams,"" suggesting incompetence rather than expertise. the ""hahahahaha aaah"" contrasts humor with disappointment, and ""#tragedy"" solidifies the negative reality being highlighted.

**step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface appears mixed (some laughter and seemingly instructional content), the true intention is deeply ironic. the speaker finds it absurd that someone who failed (""decimated his team"") is giving advice on the same topic.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""rolled out of bed for closing,"" ""#ilookreallygood,"" ""#not""
- **sentimental phrases and hashtags:** ""rolled out of bed for closing"" suggests a casual, possibly sleepy state. the hashtag ""#ilookreallygood"" seems positive, but the following hashtag ""#not"" negates it, indicating the opposite of looking good.

### step 2: deducing the true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style:** the use of the phrase ""#not"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. it's a common rhetorical device to state something and then immediately negate it to imply the opposite. hence, ""#ilookreallygood #not"" clearly implies that the person doesn't look good at all.

### step 3: comparing surface sentiment and true intention
- **surface vs. true meaning:** on the surface, it might seem like the person is commenting on their appearance with hashtags. however, the true intention is sarcasm, as the ""#not"" directly contradicts the supposed positive self-assessment, indicating that the person looks far from good.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the hashtags ""#irony"", ""#howmanygods"", and ""#punctuationmatters"" suggest a play on words and a deeper, likely humorous or sarcastic undertone. the use of parentheses to emphasize the words ""gods"" and ""gift"" hints at a deliberate attempt to highlight a contrast or absurdity.
- language style: the juxtaposition of ""gods"" and ""gift"" on different arms of the quarterback humorously suggests an exaggerated sense of divine intervention or favoritism.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- **emojis:** 😕😮😆😆 - these emojis convey a range of emotions. the first two (😕, 😮) suggest confusion or surprise, while the latter two (😆😆) convey amusement or laughter.

### step 2: deduce the true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""defo up to something"" implies a suspicion of ulterior motives behind the good deed (cooking breakfast).
- **language style:** the juxtaposition of the positive act (cooked breakfast) with suspicion suggests humor and skepticism, typically found in sarcastic remarks. the use of emojis enhances this complex emotional range, layering confusion and humor.

### step 3: compare and analyze

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

the text contains repeated phrases (""coin ! lecoincanard: coin ! lecoincanard: coin !"") followed by ""have a wank over this hashtag"" and a mention of a hashtag ""fazzanelli: jeffroylat have a wank over this hashtag #not..."". the phrase ""have a wank"" is a vulgar and dismissive way of saying that someone is wasting their time or effort.

### step 2: true intention
the repetition of ""coin ! lecoincanard"" appears nonsensical or placeholder-like, while ""have a wank over this hashtag"" and ""#not..."" suggest a dismissive or mocking attitude towards the hashtag mentioned. the use of ""not..."" implies negation and could be sarcastically indicating that the hashtag is not worth the attention it's getting.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the post includes positive and trendy hashtags such as #cool, #cute, #style, which generally convey a positive and upbeat sentiment. there are no clear indications of negativity or sarcasm in the hashtags or the language used.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style is straightforward, consisting of mostly hashtags commonly used on social media platforms to describe content about fashion, style, and personal updates. the inclusion of a link suggests that the user is sharing something they are excited about, possibly related to fashion or a personal photo. there are no rhetorical devices evident that would hint at an underlying sarcastic meaning.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### Example:
Input:
""oh look at me! i'm making people happy! i'm a magical man from happy land! who lives in a gumdrop house on lolly pop lane!""

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

### Example:
Input: @dedpool1979 there wasn't room for #loveyoubro

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""there wasn't room for"" could imply a literal or figurative lack of physical or metaphorical space.
- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

- keywords: ""hope,"" ""mess up""
- the overall tone seems casual and might imply concern or jest.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""hope the header didn't mess up that barnet"" likely employs sarcasm. ""barnet"" is a slang term for hair, and hoping that a header (in football/soccer, heading the ball) didn't mess it up could be seen as implying there was significant concern about the hair being perfect, which is not usually a major concern in the context of sports.
- this casual use of slang and concern seems exaggerated for humorous effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is mixed but leans towards jest or casual concern.
- the true intention, considering the context and phrasing, suggests sarcasm as it exaggerates concern for hair being messed up in a sporting context.

the surface sentiment appears to be positive, focusing on eagerness and willingness to learn. phrases like ""always trying to learn"" and ""i'll try to guess"" suggest a determined and optimistic mindset.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention can be deduced by examining possible rhetorical devices. the phrase ""without my admin's help"" might imply that the person usually relies heavily on their admin for such tasks, and the context suggests that the task might be difficult. the phrase ""always trying to learn"" could be a genuine statement of self-improvement, but in this context, it might also imply a sense of frustration or a sarcastic tone towards the repetitive nature of needing to learn basics again and again.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
upon comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, it seems likely that the statement is not simply about learning but also hints at an underlying frustration or cynical acceptance of the situation. the context suggests a subtle sarcastic undertone where the speaker expresses a resigned willingness to handle a challenging task that they believe they should already know.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: given the context and the use of a public tag (@tomcrean), the sentence may imply criticism. the use of ""great"" in combination with ""last minute substitutions"" can indicate that the substitutions were unexpected and possibly led to a negative outcome, hinting at irony or sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment is positive, but the true intention, given the context of how unexpected last-minute decisions typically backfire in sports, suggests criticism. the discrepancy between the surface praise and true criticism indicates the sentence is sarcastic.

### step 2: deduction of true intent
- **rhetorical devices:** the sentence contrasts ""mexico's streets aren't the only ones taken"" with ""protesters upset over decision in chokehold death take the streets again.""
- **language style:** the latter part of the sentence uses a comparison to emphasize the idea that protests are happening in multiple places, suggesting a commentary on widespread unrest.

#### conclusion:
the statement does not show clear sarcastic devices like exaggeration, extreme contrast, or a flippant tone. the intent appears to be informative rather than mocking or sarcastic.

- language style:
  - ""great,"" is an enthusiastic greeting, but paired with ""#not just for girls"" it feels a bit forced or defensive.
  - lack of context for ""great,"" makes it ambiguous without additional information.

- language style: the use of ""love"" in ""love 12 hour days"" is sarcastic, indicating the opposite feeling.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment might initially seem positive with the use of ""#tgif"" but this is immediately negated by ""oh just kidding"" and the rest of the text.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the surface sentiment of the sentence is very positive and cheerful. phrases like ""making people happy,"" ""magical man from happy land,"" and ""gumdrop house on lolly pop lane"" invoke imagery of happiness, magic, and fantasy places filled with joy.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - upon closer inspection, the exaggerated and fantastical nature of the language suggests it's not meant to be taken literally. there is an over-the-top quality to the statement that implies a mockery of the sentiment being expressed.
   
3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment (overly cheerful and fantastical) and the likely true intention (mockery or criticism of something not actually happy or magical) indicates sarcasm. the speaker is likely expressing frustration or dissatisfaction in a sardonic manner.

### Example:
Input:
""i like listening to dads truck drivers tell me about them going to the strip joint and their old lady getting mad at them over it :face_with_tears_of_joy:""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""i like listening to"" suggests a positive sentiment.
- the emoji "":face_with_tears_of_joy:"" usually indicates laughter or enjoyment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the content of the sentence involves truck drivers talking about visiting strip joints and their wives getting angry, which is typically not something people genuinely enjoy hearing about.
- the use of informal and slightly derogatory terms like ""dads truck drivers"" and ""their old lady"" suggests a mocking tone.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (positive, enjoyment) is sharply contrasted by the actual content (which implies annoyance or discomfort), indicating sarcasm.

- ""making the most out of my last vacation day"" suggests a positive sentiment, implying someone is trying to enjoy their time.
- the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#tvandsleep"" imply a contrasting sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- the hashtag ""#not"" directly contradicts the phrase ""making the most"".
- ""#tvandsleep"" indicates that the person is likely spending their vacation day in a mundane or unexciting manner, contrary to what one would expect when “making the most” out of a vacation day.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment (positive, ""making the most out of my last vacation day"") is directly contradicted by the reality of the day being spent watching tv and sleeping, indicating a lack of excitement.
- this contradiction and the use of ""#not"" indicate a sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:
""love being able to be comfortable in my own room:smiling_face_with_open_mouth::thumbs_up_sign:""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence superficially appears to have a positive sentiment. phrases like ""love being able to be comfortable in my own room"" and the use of emojis (smiling face and thumbs-up) contribute to this.

#### step 2: true intention
however, the structure and word choice need further examination to uncover the actual sentiment. ""love being able to be comfortable"" combined with the casual, almost exaggerated tone often suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what's being stated. 

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the surface sentiment (positive) with the inferred underlying sentiment (negative or frustrated), the incongruity indicates sarcasm. there could be an unintended situation that's the opposite of comfort, making the statement sarcastic.

the sentence superficially appears to have conflicting sentiments. phrases like ""what a lovely day to drive"" might initially suggest a positive sentiment. however, the hashtags ""#not #boo #fog #work"" and the emoticons (😳😳😳) notably contribute to a negative or frustrated tone.

### step 2: true intention
the use of the phrase ""what a lovely day to drive"" combined with negative hashtags and emojis suggests that the speaker is saying the opposite of what they actually mean. this indicates that the speaker might indeed be experiencing a situation that makes it an unlovely day to drive, potentially due to fog and having to go to work.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
by juxtaposing the seemingly positive statement ""what a lovely day to drive"" with the immediately following negative elements (hashtags and emojis), the sentiment shifts clearly to a negative one. this contrast indicates that the statement ""what a lovely day to drive"" is being used sarcastically.

### Example:
Input
""learned to play 3 string notes on the guitar #pro#idiot""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence uses the hashtag ""#pro"" which is commonly associated with being proficient or skilled. however, it also uses the hashtag ""#idiot"", a derogatory term suggesting incompetence.

#### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro"" (professional) with ""idiot"" creates a contrast that is inherently sarcastic. the speaker claims to be a ""pro"" for a minimal achievement (""3 string notes""), which is an intentionally exaggerated statement to highlight their lack of real skill.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has conflicting indicators: ""pro"" suggests competence while ""idiot"" suggests incompetence. the true meaning becomes clear through this contradiction, revealing the statement is not meant to be taken at face value but rather sarcastically mocks the minimal achievement.

the sentence uses the hashtag ""#irony"", indicating the speaker finds something contradictory or absurd about the situation. the statement seems critical in tone, challenging the idea that mothers should only breastfeed in private.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker is highlighting a perceived contradiction or hypocrisy: restaurants, which are social places where people eat together, advocating for breastfeeding to be a private act contrasts with their nature. the use of ""#irony"" underscores the speaker's disbelief and criticism of this stance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows a critical tone and the term ""#irony"". the true intention is to reveal a contradiction, suggesting that the stance taken by restaurants is absurd or hypocritical. this combination implies that the sentence is sarcastic in nature.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" suggests high praise.
- emojis: 
  - :face_with_tears_of_joy:: typically used to indicate something very funny.
  - :weary_face:: often used to express sarcasm or exaggeration.
  - :see-no-evil_monkey:: can imply something awkward or something meant to be hidden.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""best joke i've heard in awhile"" could be an exaggeration.
- contradictory emojis: :weary_face: and :see-no-evil_monkey: can hint at an underlying insincerity, suggesting that the speaker may not genuinely find the joke funny.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly positive.
- the use of mixed emojis (particularly :weary_face:) indicates a potential disjunction between the expressed sentiment and the true intention.
- the presence of :see-no-evil_monkey: multiple times adds a layer of awkwardness or disbelief to the statement.

- keywords: ""shweeeet"" is typically a positive term, suggesting something enjoyable or pleasant.
- hashtag: ""#not"" directly negates the positive sentiment expressed previously.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the use of ""#not"" at the end clearly indicates sarcasm, as it negates the previous statement.
- language style: the exaggerated positive term ""shweeeet"" followed by the negating hashtag suggests an insincere or mocking tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** the hashtag #loveyoubro typically conveys a positive and affectionate sentiment.
- **sentimental indicators:** the use of ""love"" in the hashtag directly suggests a positive emotion.

**step 2: deduction of true intent**

- **language style:** the sentence does not employ overtly sarcastic language, such as exaggerated praise or overly negative words.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intent:** the surface sentiment is affectionate due to #loveyoubro. the statement about ""there wasn't room"" likely refers to a context-specific situation (e.g., physical space, social media post limitations) rather than an attempt at sarcasm. no stark contrast between surface sentiment and true intent is evident.

the phrase contains ""al jazeera is pro anti - #gamergate"" and mentions ""feminism, or something."" the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" suggests that the statement might not be intended to be taken literally and already hints at sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of ""pro anti - #gamergate"" (which itself is a complex and often contentious topic) and the casual dismissal ""because feminism, or something"" indicates a flippant tone. the use of ""#irony"" further supports that the statement is likely mocking the idea being presented rather than endorsing it.
