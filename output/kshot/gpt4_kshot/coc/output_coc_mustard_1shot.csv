",BBT,1,"
### Example:
Input: chandler: oh i left them in my bulldozer .. i don't have tools!

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment: the keywords ""oh i left them in my bulldozer"" indicate an absurd or highly unlikely scenario, especially following the statement ""i don't have tools!"". there's a hint of exaggeration and irony.

step 2: true intention: chandler is using hyperbole (mentioning a bulldozer) to emphasize that he never had tools in the first place. the true intention is to humorously indicate a lack of tools, rather than to provide an actual explanation.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment shows an exaggerated and humorous scenario, while the true intention is to emphasize a lack of tools through irony. this incongruence between the absurd statement and the true message suggests sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the keywords ""it's just a privilege"" indicate high praise and admiration. the phrase conveys a positive and respectful sentiment towards the person's mental abilities.

### step 2: true intention
sheldon is known for his socially awkward and often deadpan delivery, which can sometimes mask sarcasm. the context in which he says this can determine whether it is genuine or sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the high praise (surface sentiment) and sheldon's typical manner of speaking, the phrase could be an exaggerated form of admiration, potentially laden with sarcasm depending on context. however, if we consider sheldon's characteristic personality, he often uses formal and grandiose language to deliver sarcasm.

given this, it's likely that the sentence is sarcastic, as sheldon might be using exaggerated praise to indicate dissatisfaction or disbelief.

### Example:
Input:
penny: ooh, i'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

### Example:
Input:
howard: it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase ""it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now"" contains elements of introspection and discomfort. keywords like ""hard"" suggest a negative or difficult sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
there are no rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that imply a sarcastic tone. the language used is straightforward, describing a genuine emotion of difficulty or embarrassment when facing the person mentioned.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in expressing a feeling of discomfort without any hint of irony, exaggeration, or insincerity. the sentence is direct and earnest.

**conclusion:**
the sentence is not sarcastic because the sentiment expressed on the surface aligns with the true intention, and there is no indication of sarcasm.

        ","**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase ""since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."" contains elements of generosity or offering something useful. the keyword ""you can have"" indicates a positive or giving sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
when analyzing the true intention, context is important. sheldon is known for his literal and often sarcastic commentary. the mention of ""bee season"" and offering ""epinephrine"" (which is used for allergic reactions, often to bee stings) can imply a sarcastic tone. the statement could imply that the recipient wouldn't need epinephrine since there is no immediate danger of bees, which can be seen as a sarcastic remark.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
the surface sentiment appears to be positive, offering help. however, the true intention behind the statement could be sarcastic, implying the offer is unnecessary. given sheldon's known character, the language style, and the context, it can be interpreted as sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the sentence likely contains sarcasm because the surface sentiment of offering help contrasts with the implied unnecessary nature of the offer.

- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to negative. the scenario described involves a superhero rescue turning gruesome, which isn't typically associated with positivity.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the description of superman's rescue attempt turning fatal is clearly an exaggerated and fictional scenario, deviating from the usual portrayal of superhero rescues. the use of detailed physics and the morbid outcome are likely intended for comedic effect, indicating the use of irony or sarcasm to criticize the unrealistic aspects of superhero feats.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2
- the surface sentiment (neutral to negative) does not align with the true intention (irony/sarcasm). the descriptive detail and exaggerated scenario strongly suggest sarcasm, as the speaker is highlighting the absurdity of superhero rescues if taken literally.

Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**

- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- leonard is describing his parents naming him leonard and placing him in advanced placement classes.
- the literal meaning suggests a frustration or dissatisfaction with the actions of his parents.
- the surface sentiment appears to be one of annoyance or sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the statement suggests that leonard believes these actions made it more likely for him to be bullied.
- the phrase ""wasn't getting me beaten up enough"" is a rhetorical device called irony, implying the opposite of what is literally stated.
- the irony indicates that leonard believes these actions made social interactions more difficult rather than better.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- on the surface, the sentiment could be taken as a factual recount of past events, but the phrasing and context imply a deeper dissatisfaction.
- the true intention is to mock the idea that his parents' actions were beneficial, suggesting instead that they were detrimental.
- the disparity between the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals an underlying sarcastic tone.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords:** ""cut the foreigner in half"", ""a billion more where he came from""
- the surface sentiment appears highly negative and exaggerated towards foreigners. 

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs extreme exaggeration and irony. it's unlikely that the speaker truly means to advocate for cutting someone in half; instead, this hyperbole is used to make a point.
- **language style:** the use of such an extreme example suggests that raj is not serious but is instead using sarcasm to highlight an underlying issue, possibly the disposability or dehumanization of foreigners.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is very negative and extreme, but given the context and the use of exaggeration, it's clear that the true intention is to criticize or mock the underlying sentiment rather than to promote it seriously.
- this contradiction strongly indicates sarcasm.

with the presence of hyperbole and the clear contrasting intent, the label is:

Steps:

- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- the phrase ""i'm sorry"" is typically used to express regret, but it’s followed by ""there's just no room for you in my wallet"", which is a humorous or exaggerated way of saying ""i won’t give you money"" or ""i won't support you financially.""
- the combination of an apology with a clearly dismissive message suggests an ironic or sarcastic tone.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the apparent remorse in ""i'm sorry"" does not align with the dismissive phrase ""no room for you in my wallet"".
- this incongruity indicates that sheldon is not genuinely sorry; instead, he is using sarcasm to emphasize his refusal to provide financial support.

Input:
chandler: you know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

- sheldon uses the phrase ""just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly.""
- the word ""just"" may imply something ordinary or unremarkable.
- the subject matter, ""applied particle physics quarterly,"" is a scientific journal, which might not be of interest to everyone but could be exciting to someone in that field.

### step 2: true intention
- sheldon often exhibits a very literal and straightforward way of speaking. he is a character known to take things seriously, especially when it comes to science and academics.
- given sheldon’s character, saying ""just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly"" could indicate genuine excitement or interest, despite the word ""just"" making it sound understated.
- however, without clear exaggeration or stark contrast in meaning, it is unlikely that sheldon intended sarcasm here.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- on the surface, the language appears neutral, with ""just"" slightly downplaying the subject.
- from sheldon's perspective, though, the statement is likely straightforward and sincere.
- there doesn't seem to be a significant contrast between surface sentiment and true intention.

### Example:
Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- keywords: ""weird"", ""yours came"", ""mine didn't""
- sentimental phrases: the word ""weird"" can carry a neutral to slightly negative connotation depending on context. ""yours came"" and ""mine didn't"" are factual statements.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""that is so weird"" seems to suggest an expectation that both items should have behaved in the same way (both should have either come or not come).
- the statement ""that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't"" indicates surprise or frustration that the expected outcome did not occur.
- the context suggests that the speaker finds it unjust or unexpected, which hints at the use of irony—a common feature in sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the phrase ""that is so weird"" implies an incongruity between the expectation and reality.
- the context in which one person's item has arrived and the other's has not suggests an ironic tone, which can often be used to convey sarcasm.
- penny is likely expressing frustration or disbelief rather than a genuine observation about something being ""weird"".

the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly positive. the phrase ""do you think penny will come here and take care of us?"" doesn't inherently convey strong emotions such as anger, frustration, or happiness.

### step 2: true intention
to deduce the true intention, we must consider the context. sheldon is known for his sarcastic remarks in ""the big bang theory"". the sentence could be rhetorical, suggesting that sheldon doesn't believe penny will actually come and take care of them. additionally, it could imply distrust in penny's willingness or ability to help.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly positive but considering sheldon's character and the context, the true intention is likely to be negative and sarcastic. he is possibly mocking or questioning penny's reliability in a subtle manner.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- surface sentiment appears to be one of frustration or urgency.
- keywords like ""now?!"" and exaggeration about the tongue swelling to the size of a brisket imply a strong reaction.
- the statement suggests an exaggerated scenario, indicating that howard is responding to a demand or question he finds unreasonable.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket"" is clearly hyperbole, meant to illustrate the impossibility or absurdity of waiting until something so extreme happens.
- the use of this exaggerated imagery is a way for howard to stress that action should be taken immediately, and that the alternative is ridiculous.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).

**step 2: true intention**
there are no rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that imply a sarcastic tone. the language used is straightforward, describing a genuine emotion of difficulty or embarrassment when facing the person mentioned.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in expressing a feeling of discomfort without any hint of irony, exaggeration, or insincerity. the sentence is direct and earnest.

**conclusion:**
the sentence is not sarcastic because the sentiment expressed on the surface aligns with the true intention, and there is no indication of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase ""you were very clear. as was everyone else at the table."" on the surface suggests a sense of acknowledgment and agreement. keywords like ""clear"" indicate a positive recognition of the clarity in communication.

**step 2: true intention**
however, knowing sheldon's character, this phrase likely contains an underlying message. sheldon often uses a straightforward style to mask his sarcasm. the repetition and emphasis on ""everyone else at the table"" suggests irritation or disdain, implying that the speaker is possibly being overly dramatic about how ""clear"" everything was.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
the surface sentiment indicates a positive or neutral feeling of acknowledgment, but the true intention reveals a likely sarcasm due to the context and the emphasis placed. the mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention is indicative of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
given that the surface sentiment does not align with the true intention, the sentence demonstrates a sarcastic tone.

Input:
penny: ooh, i'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

### Example:
Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""publish"", ""include"", ""inhaler"".
- there's no explicit sentimental phrase in this sentence. however, the mention of an ""inhaler"" might indicate a situation of anxiety or difficulty breathing, which can be interpreted as critical or mocking in certain contexts.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase appears to be about publishing something and including an inhaler. the suggestion to include an inhaler seems out of place and over-the-top, which might imply that the scenario or content to be published is likely to cause significant stress or difficulty, exaggeratedly so.
- the use of exaggeration here (as one wouldn't typically include an inhaler with a publication) suggests a rhetorical device often used in sarcasm to highlight a point humorously.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- there's a mundane activity (publishing) paired with an exaggerated, unlikely action (including an inhaler). this contrast hints at sarcasm, implying that the content is so distressing or intense that an inhaler would be necessary, highlighting the absurdity in a mocking tone.

the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly frustrated, as indicated by the phrases ""i don't know"" and ""i'm getting a bunch of static.""

### step 2:
to determine the true intention, we need to check for any rhetorical devices, language style, or context that might suggest sarcasm. the phrase ""i don't know. it just died."" could be interpreted in two ways: genuinely not knowing what happened, or expressing frustration in a sarcastic tone. without additional context, it's challenging to differentiate.

### step 3:
by comparing step 1 and step 2, the sentence could be interpreted as either genuine or sarcastic. the lack of explicit sarcastic indicators such as exaggerated phrases or contradictory language makes it difficult to conclusively label it as sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of concern for mrs. wolowitz's sensitivity while also making a peculiar statement about fashion models with an abnormal appearance.

### step 2: true intention
- common sense implies that no one would genuinely prefer fashion models to be pruny and bug-eyed.
- the phrasing involves exaggeration and an incongruous comparison, utilizing humor and irony.
- the statement ""lucky for her i like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed"" clearly suggests sarcasm, as it contrasts typical beauty standards with an absurd preference, which no one would realistically have.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the true intention is to mock the situation by highlighting an absurd and hyperbolic preference, indicating sarcasm.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning (a factual statement regarding sensitivity to chlorine and a bizarre preference) and the true intention (mocking and sarcastic humor) clearly points to sarcasm.

- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""would it work if i just punched you in the face?""
- **sentimental tone:** the tone is aggressive and confrontational.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of an extreme action like ""punched you in the face"" suggests that the speaker does not actually intend to punch someone but is likely expressing extreme frustration or irritation.
- **language style:** the phrase is hyperbolic and unlikely to be a literal suggestion, implying a degree of irony or exaggeration.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the aggressive and confrontational surface sentiment contrasts with a likely non-literal intention, suggesting the use of hyperbole for effect.

- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral. the phrase ""answering the question once and for all"" suggests a definite resolution or clarification, and the statement is informational in nature.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means
- the phrase ""answering the question once and for all"" can sometimes carry an implicit tone of exasperation or frustration, particularly if the question has been asked numerous times or if the answer is well-known and the question itself seems redundant.
- the word ""bailed"" also has a slightly negative connotation, implying that wolowitz left medical school in a hurried or irresponsible manner.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2
- while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention may hint towards a subtle mockery or a jab at wolowitz's decision to leave medical school. the use of ""once and for all"" suggests that the speaker believes the reason should be obvious or that the topic has been over-discussed, which may point to a sarcastic undertone.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:
the contrast between accommodating efforts (""let's go next door"") and the absurdity of building a teddy bear for someone as an immediate alternative plan indicates a sarcastic tone. raj is likely not serious about building a bear, but rather using the suggestion to humorously address the dissatisfaction.

- analyze rhetorical devices: the phrase ""there's no hurry"" may indicate irony or impatience. ""tell them more about their secret love for each other"" has an exaggerated, mocking tone.
- language style: leonard is known for his use of sarcasm and underhanded comments, especially in contexts involving interpersonal tensions or humor.
- true intention: leonard likely means the opposite of what he says. he's probably pointing out an awkward or uncomfortable situation and using irony to suggest that discussing it further would not be beneficial.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive discussion of love) does not match the true intention (mocking and possibly highlighting discomfort). the exaggeration and context suggest leonard is being sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""what are these? claws?"" uses a direct question format. there are no immediate sentimental phrases or emojis present. the keywords ""claws"" suggest something sharp or beastly.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).
- this juxtaposition between the mundane observation and the exaggerated implication suggests sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment:
- the phrase ""kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?"" is a declarative statement followed by a rhetorical question. the surface sentiment seems to imply an invigorating or life-affirming experience.

### step 2: true intention:
- given the format of the sentence, the rhetorical question might suggest irony. the speaker might be referring to a situation that is not typically life-affirming (e.g., a dangerous or unpleasant experience) and contrasting it with the expected positive sentiment.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment suggests a positive experience, but the structure and context (the rhetorical question) may imply the contrary. this juxtaposition hints at sarcasm, as the speaker might actually mean the opposite of the literal message.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

### step 2: true intention
- considering sheldon’s well-known personality from ""the big bang theory,"" his language is often direct but can be sarcastic. the phrase ""this fairly pointless conversation"" suggests that he views the conversation as a waste of time. the use of ""assuming i can keep up this pace"" also hints at exasperation rather than a straightforward logistical calculation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly negative due to the impatience implied by the phrasing. the true intention, considering sheldon's disdain for engaging in what he sees as unimportant conversations, is to dismiss the conversation as unworthy of his time. this discrepancy signals sarcasm.

the phrase ""do cocaine smugglers write 'cocaine' on the box?"" is a rhetorical question that implies disbelief and a degree of incredulity. it is not a serious query but one that suggests an obvious answer.

### step 2: true intention

surface sentiment: the keywords ""change my name"" and ""go live with my cousin and her husband, avi, in israel"" indicate an extreme measure or drastic scenario.

### step 2:
true intention: howard is likely using hyperbole to suggest an over-the-top solution to a problem he's facing. the true intention is to emphasize frustration or desperation in a humorous way, rather than genuinely considering such a drastic action.

### step 3:
comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment presents an exaggerated and extreme solution (changing name and moving to israel) which contrasts with the underlying intention of humorously expressing frustration or desperation. this incongruence suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","given the input, the statement ""hardly a day goes by when i don't think about it."" hints at a potential deeper sentiment.

### steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase suggests a strong sense of nostalgia or fixation. it implies frequent and near-daily contemplation about ""it,"" whatever ""it"" may be.

**step 2: true intention**
- considering that saying ""hardly a day goes by when i don't think about it"" is a common way to emphasize frequent thinking, it has a chance of being sincere.
- however, the term can also imply an exaggeration, especially if the subject doesn't typically require such frequent attention. therefore, it would be important to consider if leonard is using irony.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment and true intention can either align, showing a sincere frequent thought, or diverge with irony and exaggeration, indicating sarcasm.
- without more context, it’s challenging to fully discern the level of sincerity. however, given this kind of phraseology tends often to be used sarcastically to emphasize the opposite (i.e., leonard may rarely think about ""it""), the statement might carry an ironic undertone.

### Example:
Input:
sheldon: darn. if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the statement includes ""darn,"" which indicates mild disappointment.
- ""if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us"" sounds like a polite regret or an exclusion.

**step 2: true intention**
- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly disappointed.
- sheldon’s known tendency for sarcasm and the context suggest a hidden, sarcastic meaning, as he is likely masking his true feelings behind a veneer of politeness.

- the exaggeration (""trying to pummel you to death"") suggests hyperbole, a common tool in sarcasm to express frustration or irritation humorously rather than literally.

- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

### step-by-step analysis:
**step 1: surface sentiment** 
- keywords: ""terrific,"" ""i don't think penny wants me to go.""
- sentimental phrases: ""terrific"" suggests a positive sentiment; however, it's followed by a hesitation (""it's just that..."") and a negative outcome (""i don't think penny wants me to go"").
- surface sentiment: mixed but skewed towards negative due to the concern expressed about penny's feelings.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: the word ""terrific"" seems exaggerated or not sincere given the context. hesitation and the following statement typically indicate disappointment or concern.
- language style: leonard often uses understated and self-deprecating humor. the statement seems to convey disappointment or resignation rather than genuine positivity.
- true intention: leonard is likely not thrilled and is pointing out that the situation is less than ideal because penny doesn't want him to go.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the positive ""terrific"" contrasts sharply with the underlying negative sentiment of the second part, suggesting that leonard is using sarcasm.

   - **sentiment:** the surface sentiment appears to be a plea or request, suggesting concern or worry.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - **analysis of rhetorical devices and language style:** there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as hyperbole, contradiction, or exaggerated tones. the repetition of ""please"" further supports a genuine plea rather than mockery or irony.
   - **intention:** the speaker seems to be making an earnest request, driven by genuine emotions rather than employing sarcasm.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**

   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: the phrase ""behind on my wiki-reading"" is a humorous way to express that the speaker has other priorities that may seem unimportant to others. the mention of being ""on a john grisham kick"" uses a casual, conversational tone which often can be humorous in context.
- true intention: the statement likely has an undercurrent of humor, as being ""behind on wiki-reading"" isn't typically seen as a serious concern, combined with the prioritization of reading john grisham novels.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (neutral and mundane) contrasts with the true intention (light-hearted humorous way to indicate other priorities).

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in expressing a feeling of discomfort without any hint of irony, exaggeration, or insincerity. the sentence is direct and earnest.

**conclusion:**

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""no, i don't want any chocolate!"" is articulated with an exclamatory and firm tone. the word ""no"" and the emphatic ""!"" suggest a strong refusal, which conveys a negative sentiment towards the offer of chocolate.

### step 2: true intention
leonard's statement might be an expression of genuine refusal. however, the context and the exaggerated firmness in response to a simple offer of chocolate could indicate sarcasm. for instance, if leonard is known to have a sweet tooth or if he frequently accepts chocolate, his refusal might imply that he is teasing or being humorous.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment shows a straightforward refusal. however, the tone and context may suggest that leonard is not genuinely upset or rejecting the chocolate in a serious manner but rather using this strong refusal as a form of humor or sarcasm.

### conclusion
given the firm refusal combined with the context suggesting potential humor, the sentence is likely sarcastic.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

- the phrase ""a complex socio-economic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning"" indicates that waitressing at the cheese cake factory is being described as a significant and intellectually demanding task.

### step 2: true intention

- considering sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" he has a tendency to use hyperbole and complex language. he often speaks in a condescending or mocking manner about things he considers beneath his intellectual level.
- the context of waitressing being overly analyzed is likely an example of this exaggeration, implying the opposite—waitressing may not actually be seen as a complex activity requiring such intensive planning by sheldon.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- on the surface, the statement shows a highly positive and intellectually framed sentiment. however, taking into account sheldon's characteristic hyperbole and probable condescending viewpoint, it's clear that the true intention is to mock the notion that waitressing requires such complex thinking.
- this discrepancy between surface sentiment and the true underlying message indicates sarcasm.

Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

### response:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the literal meaning here involves a very specific and fantastical scenario about destroying human toast on a fictional spaceship from the battlestar galactica series.
- the sentiment appears fantastical and somewhat absurd.

step 2: true intention
- understanding that ""battlestar galactica"" is a well-known science fiction tv series and that human toast is clearly not a real concept, it is evident that this phrase is not intended to be taken literally.
- the speaker, sheldon, is known for his sarcastic and humorous remarks in the show ""the big bang theory."" this suggests the statement is meant to be humorous and absurd, and should not be taken at face value.
- the use of the phrase ""destroy all the human toast"" and the context of a sci-fi setting add a layer of hyperbole, indicating exaggeration for comedic effect.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is fantastical and absurd. 
- the true intention is to use hyperbole and absurdity to create a humorous and sarcastic remark.
- the mismatch between the literal and true meaning indicates sarcasm intended to make a humorous or exaggerated point.

- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

   - there is a contrast within the sentence, with one part negative and the other positive.

   - the use of ""but look at"" introduces a sense of irony, focusing on something that is typically not a significant redeeming feature of a movie.
   - this contrast and shift in focus can indicate sarcasm, as the speaker might be highlighting the movie's lack of redeeming qualities in terms of its primary purpose (entertainment or storytelling).

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive"").

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""princess leia"", ""bernadette"", ""wonderful girl"", ""really likes you"".
- sentimental phrases: ""wonderful girl"" and ""really likes you"" carry positive connotations.

### step 2: true intention
- in the sentence, the speaker starts with ""no, i mean princess leia. of course i mean bernadette."", which indicates a correction that may hint at frustration or sarcasm due to the preceding rhetorical question. additionally, the follow-up ""she's a wonderful girl and she really likes you."" seems genuine on the surface but could also be part of the sarcastic correction.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the initial correction implying ""of course i mean bernadette"" suggests a rhetorical question, often used in sarcasm. the positive connotation words following this don't negate the sarcasm; instead, they reinforce the sarcasm as the speaker may be emphasizing the obviousness or frustration of the situation.

Input:
penny: ooh, i'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment in sheldon's statement appears to be one of enthusiastic suggestion, as indicated by the phrase ""oh, sure"" and the upbeat tone.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes evident when we consider the phrase ""have an old-fashioned eating contest"". sheldon is likely not suggesting this as a serious activity. the mention of having an ""old-fashioned eating contest"" while discussing something else (possibly equally impractical or unnecessary) indicates a critical or mocking tone which is typical in sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the enthusiastic surface sentiment contrasts sharply with the impracticality and absurdity of actually suggesting an ""old-fashioned eating contest"". this disparity suggests that sheldon's true meaning is sarcastic. he is using an exaggerated, impractical example to mock or criticize the underlying topic in discussion, highlighting the sarcastic intent.

### Example:
Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- keywords: ""nearly as amazing as"", ""third graders"", ""growing lima beans"", ""wet paper towels"".
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""nearly as amazing as"" might superficially sound positive. however, comparing it to ""third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels"" is not typically a high compliment.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels"" implies that leonard's work is being compared to a very basic and unremarkable school project.
- the use of the phrase ""nearly as amazing as"" in conjunction with the mundane activity of ""third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels"" shows a clear use of irony.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the positive phrase ""nearly as amazing"" is starkly contrasted with the very mundane and unimpressive ""third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels"".
- this contrast indicates the speaker does not mean leonard's work is genuinely amazing; instead, it is being mocked. the use of irony here is indicative of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase ""it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now"" contains elements of introspection and discomfort. keywords like ""hard"" suggest a negative or difficult sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
there are no rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that imply a sarcastic tone. the language used is straightforward, describing a genuine emotion of difficulty or embarrassment when facing the person mentioned.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in expressing a feeling of discomfort without any hint of irony, exaggeration, or insincerity. the sentence is direct and earnest.

**conclusion:**
the sentence is not sarcastic because the sentiment expressed on the surface aligns with the true intention, and there is no indication of sarcasm.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **clues:** the statement is an exclamatory sentence starting with ""oh, no, no,"" which can indicate surprise or contradiction.
- **sentiment:** the surface sentiment is one of contradiction or playful correction.

#### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:** 
  - the speaker, penny, is responding to a misunderstanding or miscommunication by clarifying what she meant.
  - the use of ""oh, no, no"" followed by a clear logical statement indicates that the speaker might be correcting a humorous or exaggerated misinterpretation.
  - there is a light-hearted tone, possibly indicating joking or sarcasm, especially since the subject is something as unusual as visiting stan lee's house.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:** 
  - the surface sentiment and the true intention show signs of humor and playful contradiction.
  - the exclamatory and correcting nature of the statement suggests that penny is responding to a misunderstanding in a sarcastic manner to highlight the absurdity of the situation.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

the surface sentiment includes curiosity or concern, indicated by the question about a ""new girlfriend"" and the suggestion that ""you might need one.""

### step 2: true intention
the true intention here seems to be mocking or teasing. asking if there's a ""new girlfriend in there"" (implying inside a fridge, presumably) and following up with ""you might need one,"" uses humor and irony to suggest that the person doesn't have a girlfriend or is in need of one, in a sarcastic manner.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""what are these? claws?"" uses a direct question format. there are no immediate sentimental phrases or emojis present. the keywords ""claws"" suggest something sharp or beastly.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).
- this juxtaposition between the mundane observation and the exaggerated implication suggests sarcasm.

leonard: oh, i'm so glad you asked it like that. you.

### response:
step 1: surface sentiment:
- the phrase ""oh, i'm so glad you asked it like that."" includes a seemingly positive sentiment with the word ""glad"".
- however, the inclusion of the word ""oh"" at the beginning and the slightly awkward phrase ""like that"" may imply some irony or insincerity.
- the abrupt end with ""you."" might signal a bit of tension or emphasis on the addressed person in an unfriendly or condescending tone.

step 2: true intention:
- the phrase likely isn’t genuinely expressing gladness but rather criticizing the way the question was asked. the sarcasm is evident in the exaggerated expression of gladness which juxtaposes with the probable annoyance.
- the sentence structure and choice of words indicate sarcasm, as leonard's response seems to downplay the worthiness of the question or the manner in which it was asked.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment appears positive but notably exaggerated.
- the true intention, derived from the analysis of tone and language, indicates criticism or irritation.
- combining these insights suggests that leonard’s expression is sarcastic, using a rhetorical device to mock or criticize indirectly.

- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- by examining the entire sentence, leonard appears to be frustrated or annoyed with the current topic of conversation and is requesting to change the subject.
- the phrase ""maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?"" seems to introduce a hint of sarcasm due to its exaggeration and hyperbolic tone, implying that the current topic is absurd or highly irrelevant.

### step 3: compare and analysis

### step 2: true intention deduction (step 2):
the rhetorical question ""you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"" is likely to be sarcastic. the use of ""so what"" indicates a challenge or criticism rather than a genuine inquiry. the phrase trivializes the action, implying that walking up and down the stairs is pointless or ridiculous.

### Example:
Input:
penny: ooh, i'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be one of admiration or reverence towards albert einstein, particularly in highlighting his work on the theoretic foundation for the laser.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'"" introduces an incongruous slang term (""bitchin'"") into what would normally be a very formal and scientific discussion. this unexpected casual language suggests an ironic twist.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the contrast between the formal discussion of einstein's scientific work and the use of the informal term ""bitchin'"" reveals a sarcastic tone. the absurdity of einstein hoping for a ""bitchin'"" device, which is not a term he would have used, confirms the sarcastic intent.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- the sentiment appears to be one of curiosity or inquiry.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""a lot of people are working on that research"" could imply that the research being done is not unique or special, perhaps suggesting that it doesn't warrant special attention.
- the question ""so what is all this?"" might indicate a degree of skepticism or a challenge to the importance or distinctiveness of the research in question.
- the phrasing can be seen as implying that leonard doesn't find the situation worthy of the perceived attention or importance it's being given, a common form of subtle sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is inquisitive and factual.
- the true intention likely has an undertone of skepticism or downplaying the importance of the research, indicating subtle sarcasm.
- the mismatch suggests that leonard's apparent curiosity is actually a way of highlighting redundancy or questioning the importance of the research, which fits a sarcastic tone.

  - inclusion of a humorous hypothetical statement about hiding the story in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.

- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment appears to be playful and humorous, with an intellectual twist given the literary reference.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - amy is recounting an incident where she was challenged to tell a dirty story and chose a classic piece of literature that fits the bill.
  - the choice of ""the miller's tale"" could be seen as a deliberate juxtaposition of high culture (chaucer) with low content (a dirty story).
  - the remark about sock drawers adds a layer of humor by incorporating an anachronistic element.
  - no evident rhetorical devices suggesting the expression of the opposite of what is meant (as would be the case with sarcasm).

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment of playfulness and humor aligns with amy’s intention to share a funny and slightly risqué anecdote.
  - there is a clear coherence between the surface sentiment and the true intention.
  - the statement lacks the characteristics of sarcasm, such as expressing contempt or mockery by saying something in a way that actually means the opposite.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: yeah, she couldn't live without the chan love.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""couldn't live without,"" ""chan love""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""couldn't live without"" suggests a high level of affection or dependency, typically positive.
- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive affection) aligns with the true intention (valuing chandler's love). there isn’t a significant gap between what is said and what is meant.

- keywords: ""accidentally got lip,"" ""happens with me and my mom""
- sentimental phrases: the question posed seems to be humorous and lighthearted, likely to elicit a laugh. there are no explicitly negative or overly positive phrases.

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: examine for hyperbole, irony, or humor
- language style: howard is likely using a playful tone. it's unusual to compare a romantic gesture with a familial one (i.e., kissing your mom). this suggests possible irony or sarcasm.
- true intention: howard is probably making a joke, implying it would be absurd for someone to mistake a romantic kiss for a familial one.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- surface sentiment (humorous and lighthearted) vs. true intention (making an ironic or humorous comparison).
- the surface-level content seems to clash with the true implication, suggesting that the statement is making a humorous or sarcastic point.

- ""in the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.” this statement superficially seems to be a matter-of-fact declaration about the appropriate place for something, potentially dolls or posters.

### step 2: true intention
- given sheldon’s character, known for his dry and often sarcastic humor, we need to dig deeper.
- this statement might be addressing something he finds childish or out of place in a context where it's not expected.
- the phrase ""where they belong"" could imply sheldon believes it's ridiculous for whatever he’s referring to (likely something someone else mentioned or did) to be outside of a child's bedroom.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

sheldon: obviously, we're no longer a justice league. we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costumes.

### response:

step 1: the surface sentiment here seems to indicate disappointment or frustration. the use of the word ""obviously"" and the phrase ""no longer a justice league"" suggests a recognition of failure or defeat. ""we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costumes"" might imply a downgrade or a loss of status.

step 2: the true intention behind the statement could be examined through the context and use of rhetorical devices. sheldon is likely using humor and exaggeration. referring to themselves as a ""justice league"" and then as ""muppet babies"" is a significant contrast intended to be humorous. it suggests that the situation is so bad that they have to downgrade to something far less esteemed, which is a common sarcastic technique.

step 3: comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, the statement has signs of sarcasm. the exaggerated shift from ""justice league"" to ""muppet babies"" is likely not meant to be taken literally but to emphasize how much their situation has deteriorated, using it as a form of humor.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment shows a tentative optimism, but if leonard's statement is taken in the context of a prolonged effort without success, it could be seen as sarcastic. however, without additional context indicating past frustration or failure, it's challenging to definitively interpret it as sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- keywords: ""taught"", ""who would have thought it?""
- sentimental phrases: ""taught"" has a neutral to positive connotation, suggesting learning or gaining knowledge. the phrase ""who would have thought it?"" can indicate surprise.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""who would have thought it?"" in this context, it can be interpreted in two ways: genuine surprise or sarcastic disbelief. given the context of sheldon (a character known for his intelligence and often condescending attitude), it's likely that the phrase ""hey, you taught me something. who would have thought it?"" is being used ironically to suggest that he didn't expect the other person to teach him anything.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the phrase ""hey, you taught me something."" can be positive when taken at face value. however, combined with ""who would have thought it?""—which implies disbelief or surprise—this suggests that sheldon is not genuinely complimenting but rather using sarcasm to indicate low expectations of the other person’s ability to teach him something.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: you know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

- sheldon uses the phrase ""an entire dinner to talk about your research"" and the rhetorical question ""where you going, the drive-thru at jack in the box?""
- the phrase suggests an expectation of a lengthy and detailed discussion.
- the rhetorical question contrasts this expectation with an implication of a brief and casual dining experience, typically associated with fast food restaurants.

### step 2: true intention

- sheldon is known for his use of sarcasm and humor.
- the significant contrast between a detailed conversation about research and the casual nature of a fast-food drive-thru implies sarcasm.
- by asking if someone is going to jack in the box (a fast-food chain), sheldon implies that it would be ridiculous to have an in-depth discussion in such an informal setting, making the statement sarcastic.

### step 3: compare and analyze

- the surface sentiment of the statement appears to be questioning and curious.
- however, the substantial contrast between the expected setting for an elaborate discussion and a fast food drive-thru, combined with sheldon's known use of sarcasm, indicates a sarcastic tone.

Steps:

the phrase ""it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now"" contains elements of introspection and discomfort. keywords like ""hard"" suggest a negative or difficult sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
there are no rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that imply a sarcastic tone. the language used is straightforward, describing a genuine emotion of difficulty or embarrassment when facing the person mentioned.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""yeah, but you were just sleeping, because i forboded you to have sex"" includes the word ""forboded,"" which might imply control or authority and the word ""just,” potentially downplaying the importance of the other person's action. the word ""yeah"" at the beginning can indicate agreement but could also be a setup for a counter-argument, hinting at a negative or condescending sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
the sentence includes an unusual phrase, ""forboded you to have sex,"" which seems exaggerated and authoritative. the overall structure points to an attempt to belittle or mock the other person. ""yeah, but"" followed by a downplaying statement is often indicative of sarcasm, as it undermines the initial agreement with a dismissive remark.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of condescension and mockery aligns with the true intention of belittling or making fun of the other person. the word choice and sentence structure suggest an over-the-top authoritative tone that is likely not meant to be taken literally.

### conclusion
the sentence is sarcastic because the true intention of mocking or belittling is consistent with the surface sentiment.

### Example:

dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

the phrase ""i'm sorry, sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?"" seems to express a mix of surprise and disbelief. the use of ""i'm sorry"" at the beginning of a question typically indicates that the speaker finds the information unexpected or astonishing.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this statement is likely to question the plausibility or absurdity of the situation. the speaker is not actually apologizing but rather using a rhetorical device to emphasize their disbelief.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of disbelief aligns with the true intention of expressing skepticism. the rhetorical device used here suggests that the speaker finds the idea of sheldon buying a loom and learning how to weave to be highly unlikely or absurd, which indicates sarcasm.

### conclusion:
the sentence contains sarcasm because the surface sentiment and true intention both point to a reaction of disbelief and skepticism, expressed in a way that highlights the absurdity of the situation.

### Example:
Input:
sheldon: darn. if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the statement includes ""darn,"" which indicates mild disappointment.
- ""if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us"" sounds like a polite regret or an exclusion.

**step 2: true intention**
- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly disappointed.
- sheldon’s known tendency for sarcasm and the context suggest a hidden, sarcastic meaning, as he is likely masking his true feelings behind a veneer of politeness.

- the statement includes terms like ""silly,"" which can downplay the own speaker's seriousness.
- descriptions like ""not concerned,"" ""don't have a problem,"" and ""wears way too much makeup"" suggest a dismissive or neutral tone on the surface.
- the phrasing ""i'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple"" introduces a hyperbolic element.

### step 2: true intention
- penny states she’s ""not concerned"" about who hangs out with whom, seemingly to emphasize she’s laid-back. but the addition of ""wears way too much makeup"" implies critical judgment.
- discussing leonard’s new girlfriend’s makeup negatively indicates jealousy or bitterness.
- hyperbolic language like ""i'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple"" sharply contrasts with the trivial topic, indicating an exaggeration clichéd in sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment: superficially dismissive, aiming to appear indifferent.
- true intention: penny is expressing jealousy or bitterness towards leonard’s new girlfriend and uses exaggeration to sarcastically mock the situation.
- the drastic shift from trivial observations to over-the-top statements indicates a strong presence of sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""seven-day course of penicillin"" and ""syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting"" have a clinical and serious connotation, while ""a mint"" seems out of place and trivial.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""yes, i'd like a seven-day course of penicillin"" suggests a medical treatment for a potential serious issue.
- the addition of ""some, uh, syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting"" continues the theme of needing serious medical attention.
- the final request, ""and a mint,"" is incongruous and trivial when compared to the serious medical requests, implying a contrast for humor.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).

### step 2: true intention
- sheldon is not actually concerned about dying from someone drinking out of leonard's glass. 
- the phrase ""the words they'll be carving into my tombstone"" indicates a gross exaggeration meant to humorously emphasize how sheldon feels about the situation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

- the literal meaning suggests that sheldon is congratulating and welcoming someone temporarily, providing them with an id card, key, and lapel pin.
- the surface sentiment appears factual and straightforward initially, but the phrase ""which leonard was too cool to wear"" introduces a hint of sentiment beyond mere facts.

### step 2: true intention
- common sense implies that congratulations and welcoming are positive actions. however, the phrase about leonard suggests a comparison or a hidden criticism.
- the phrase ""was too cool to wear"" implies that leonard's refusal to wear the pin is seen as a display of aloofness or nonchalance. 
- this language style hints at irony, as the idea of being ""too cool"" for a lapel pin is trivial and likely not meant to be taken entirely seriously.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is initially neutral and welcoming but shifts with the mention of leonard.
- the true intention behind mentioning leonard's ""too cool"" demeanor likely contrasts with sheldon's disapproval or mockery of that attitude.
- the mismatch between the welcoming tone and the implied sarcasm about leonard suggests an undertone of sarcasm.

bernadette: of course you do. you're a cutie pie! any girl would be lucky to have you!

### steps:
1. **surface sentiment analysis (step 1):**
   - the phrase ""of course you do"" can sometimes carry a sarcastic tone depending on the context, but it is not definitively sarcastic on its own. 
   - the terms ""cutie pie"" and ""lucky to have you"" are positive sentiments, suggesting praise or affection. there are no negative keywords or obvious markers of sarcasm like exaggerated praise or irony in the vocabulary.

2. **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - ""of course you do"" can be interpreted as genuine agreement or as a sarcastic comment depending on the context.
   - if the speaker is using ""cutie pie"" and ""any girl would be lucky to have you"" sincerely, it suggests affection and encouragement.
   - if the context or tone implies disbelief or mockery, those positive terms might be used sarcastically.
   - without additional contextual cues from tone or situation, these terms can be taken at face value.

3. **comparison and analysis (step 3):**
   - the surface sentiment is positive, expressed through affectionate language.
   - the true intention might be either genuine praise or sarcastic depending on contextual cues not provided in the text.
   - in the absence of deeper context suggesting mockery, the straightforward interpretation leans towards non-sarcastic, genuine affection and positive reinforcement.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment: the keywords ""oh i left them in my bulldozer"" indicate an absurd or highly unlikely scenario, especially following the statement ""i don't have tools!"". there's a hint of exaggeration and irony.

step 2: true intention: chandler is using hyperbole (mentioning a bulldozer) to emphasize that he never had tools in the first place. the true intention is to humorously indicate a lack of tools, rather than to provide an actual explanation.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment shows an exaggerated and humorous scenario, while the true intention is to emphasize a lack of tools through irony. this incongruence between the absurd statement and the true message suggests sarcasm.

step 2: true intention: amy is clearly using exaggeration and irony to mock or make fun of someone. it's unlikely she's sincerely suggesting that someone would be a good representative for a medical condition. the true intention is to humorously insult or tease the other person.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment is an exaggerated insult, and the true intention is to humorously mock the person. this incongruence, along with the use of exaggeration and irony, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""couldn't live without"" suggests a high level of affection or dependency, typically positive.
- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive affection) aligns with the true intention (valuing chandler's love). there isn’t a significant gap between what is said and what is meant.

- surface sentiment: neutral-to-slightly humorous, due to the playful creation of ""dinfast"" and mentioning ""peer-based mocking""

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: sheldon uses humor and a bit of self-deprecation by acknowledging that calling a dinner date a ""dinfast date"" could lead to mockery.
- language style: sheldon often speaks in a precise yet humorous manner; he preemptively addresses the potential for peer mockery, indicating awareness of the situation’s social dynamics.
- true intention: sheldon seems to be downplaying the significance of the dinner date by renaming it humorously, thereby making fun of the situation and preempting any teasing leonard might receive.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (neutral-to-slightly humorous) and the true intention (making fun of the situation and acknowledging the potential for mockery) suggest that the statement is delivered with a humorous intent. sheldon is likely being sarcastic by downplaying the date's significance in a convoluted manner.

- keywords/emphasis: ""let me think!"" repeated twice, followed by ""oh, i don't care.""
- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

- surface sentiment: amy appears to reprimand someone for an inappropriate action, suggesting that the person was touching her in a way she didn't approve of before handling her wrist.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase ""copping a feel"" is slang and carries a negative connotation. the context suggests it is used to imply unwanted or inappropriate physical contact.
- language style: the phrase combined with the instruction indicates annoyance but the word choice implies the statement is exaggerated for effect.
- amy’s known tendencies: if amy often uses humor or sarcasm in her remarks, this could likely be a sarcastic way to address the issue.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment seems to imply annoyance and reprimanding. the true intention, considering the exaggerated wording, suggests this could be a sarcastic way to point out inappropriate behavior.

- the sentence ""you see betrayal in others, but not yourself"" appears to be neutral or slightly accusatory on the surface. there are no keywords or phrases that strongly indicate positive or negative sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- sheldon, a character known for his intellectual and sometimes condescending nature, may be pointing out hypocrisy. the use of ""but not yourself"" suggests that the person being addressed is guilty of the same behavior they criticize in others.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly accusatory. however, the true intention seems to be highlighting hypocrisy, which could be delivered in a straightforward or sarcastic manner. given sheldon's character and the context, it's plausible that the statement is a sarcastic remark highlighting the irony.

Input:
chandler: let me think! let me think! oh, i don't care.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""let me think!"" repeated twice, followed by ""oh, i don't care.""
- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.

- language style: the comparison to a disproven fear (the earth being flat) indicates that sheldon is mocking rather than genuinely encouraging.
- sheldon’s known tendencies: sheldon is known for his sarcastic comments and tendency to mock others' intelligence subtly.

1. **surface sentiment analysis (step 1):**
   - the phrase ""i'll make you a list"" is relatively neutral, suggesting an offer to help or provide information.
   - the phrase ""oh, that would be mighty white of you"" sounds unusual and contains the word ""mighty"" which can be an intensifier, and the phrase ""white of you,"" a dated expression that usually means benevolent or generous but can easily be perceived as condescending or sarcastic in modern context. overall, this part appears to carry a sarcastic tone layered with ironic politeness.

2. **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - given the context in which ""i'll make you a list"" is stated, it seems leonard is suggesting doing something somewhat basic or trivial for someone.
   - the reply ""oh, that would be mighty white of you"" carries a clear mark of sarcasm. historically, this phrase was intended as a compliment but in modern usage, it’s often interpreted sarcastically to mock superficial acts of kindness, particularly in a racially insensitive way. the structure and wording imply irony, highlighting the emptiness or triviality of the offer.

3. **comparison and analysis (step 3):**
   - the surface sentiment initially begins neutral with the phrase ""i'll make you a list,"" suggesting a mundane offer.
   - the true intention as decoded in ""oh, that would be mighty white of you"" reveals a sarcastic undertone undermining the purported offer of help or kindness.
   - the stark contrast between the seemingly polite words and the actual sarcastic intent confirms the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

the phrase ""you have a thing of paper clips right there"" on the surface seems neutral or informative, as it merely states the availability of paper clips.

### step 2: true intention
to identify the true intention, consider any rhetorical devices or context that might suggest a sarcastic tone. the statement could be seen as dismissive or mocking if, for example, the person being addressed previously claimed to lack paper clips or something similar. the phrase lacks conventional markers of exaggeration or obvious sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly informative. however, without more context, it is challenging to definitively establish whether the true intention diverges sharply to suggest sarcasm. the statement might be sarcastic depending on the context, but this is not apparent from the text alone.

the lack of specific markers of sarcasm and the neutral informative tone lead me to conclude that the sentence ""you have a thing of paper clips right there"" does not strongly indicate sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: 
the surface sentiment appears to be initial surprise and bewilderment. phrases like ""no."" and ""how could i be so stu..."" indicate that the speaker is reacting to a realization of being deceived.

### step 2:
examining the language and rhetorical devices, the phrase ""this was all a ruse?"" suggests that the speaker, sheldon, is expressing disbelief at being tricked. the sarcasm is evident in the mocked admission of stupidity with ""how could i be so stu..."". sheldon is likely being sarcastic because his character often uses sarcasm in a high-brow manner.

### step 3:
the surface sentiment of surprise and disbelief aligns with the sarcastic interpretation of the speaker pretending to criticize himself for being fooled. there is a clear indication that sheldon does not genuinely believe he is foolish but is mocking the situation.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive"").

   - **rhetorical devices:** the simplicity of the statement combined with the context suggests a likely undertone of sarcasm, given that seeing what scientists are wearing is not typically an exciting or fashionable activity.

   - the phrase ""no, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch"" doesn't contain obvious sentimental keywords or emotional phrases. there are no emojis, but the phrase ""maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch"" shows a tinge of humor, suggesting a light-hearted or possibly mocking tone.

2. **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - sheldon is likely making a sarcastic remark. the phrase ""maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch"" implies a stereotype of an old-fashioned individual, which is unlikely the actual preference of someone. the intention seems to be to mock or make fun of a concept or suggestion in a humorous way.

3. **comparison and analysis (step 3):**
   - the surface sentiment appears humorous, and when we deduce the true intention, it aligns with sarcasm. the comment makes use of humor to dismiss or mock a certain idea.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **clues:**
  - emotionally unstable
  - heavy machinery
- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment is cautionary and concerned.

#### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - the speaker is providing a reason for not asking leonard to operate heavy machinery.
  - mentions ""emotionally unstable"" explicitly, which suggests genuine concern about leonard's mental state affecting his ability to handle a potentially dangerous task.
  - no evident rhetorical devices like irony, exaggeration, or understatement that would lead to sarcasm.
  - direct and clear language with no hidden or oppositional meanings.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - both surface sentiment and true intention align as expressions of concern and caution.
  - there is no discrepancy between what is being said and what is meant.
  - the statement is straightforward and lacks the complexity typical of sarcasm where the literal and intended meanings diverge.

- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment appears to be complimentary and positive.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - the use of ""well, yeah"" introduces a hesitant or doubtful tone.
  - the phrase ""have you ever tried it?"" implies that the person is unsure about the other’s experience, creating a paradox because one can assume someone would inherently be aware of their own sexual performance.
  - this suggests a rhetorical device, likely sarcasm, where the speaker is not genuinely complimenting but rather criticizing in a mocking way.
  - the language and structure indicate a contradiction between the surface sentiment and the true intention, leading to a sarcastic tone.

- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment appears positive and complimentary.
  - the true intention, revealed through rhetorical questioning, indicates criticism and mockery.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the keywords ""instead of just living in your mother's house"" and ""you could actually live inside her body"" indicate an outrageous and highly improbable scenario. this is an absurd suggestion that is meant to be shocking and humorous.

### step 2: true intention
leonard is using an outrageous example to highlight the absurdity of simply living in one's mother's house as an adult. the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea of living with one's mother well into adulthood by presenting an even more ridiculous scenario.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows an outrageous and exaggerated scenario, while the true intention is to mock or criticize the idea of living with one's mother by using irony and absurdity. this incongruence between the absurd statement and the true message strongly suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""trust me,"" ""you're not jewish,"" ""that's how they get you.""
- **sentimental tone:** generally flat with a possible hint of an advisory tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""that's how they get you"" could be interpreted as a casual or serious assertion but doesn't inherently carry a sarcastic tone.
- **language style:** the language doesn't show a clear contradictory or ironic style that typically defines sarcasm. 

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** there is no strong contradiction between the surface sentiment of advice or declaration and the deeper intention behind the statement.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""to all the good times we had,"" ""when we went camping,"" ""telling each other all our secrets,"" ""i'm addicted to pedicures,"" ""he lost his virginity to his cousin.""
- **sentimental tone:** the phrase starts off seemingly nostalgic and positive, referencing ""good times."" however, the mention of personal secrets takes a surprising turn with the revelation of sensitive, potentially embarrassing information (losing virginity to a cousin).

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** there's a juxtaposition between the expected sentiment of good memories and the unexpected, awkward revelation about personal secrets. this contrast creates a sense of irony.
- **language style:** the revelation of such an intimate and controversial secret in a casual recounting of ""good times"" hints at a sarcastic undertone, suggesting that these ""good times"" might actually be awkward or regrettable.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is initially positive, reflecting on ""good times."" however, the true intention seems to highlight the absurdity or awkward nature of the memories, indicating a discrepancy between the outward expression and the underlying meaning.

dorothy: what are these? claws?

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""what are these? claws?"" uses a direct question format. there are no immediate sentimental phrases or emojis present. the keywords ""claws"" suggest something sharp or beastly.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).
- this juxtaposition between the mundane observation and the exaggerated implication suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
1. **what is the surface sentiment?**
    - the surface sentiment is positive. ""yeah!"" is an affirmative and enthusiastic response, often indicating agreement or excitement.

2. **what is the true intention?**
    - given that ""yeah!"" is a short and seemingly straightforward response, there are no strong indicators of sarcasm such as overly exaggerated enthusiasm or contradictory language. 

3. **compare and analyze step 1 and step 2:**
    - the surface sentiment (positive) matches the true intention (agreeing or expressing excitement) without any signs of sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment?
the surface sentiment appears to be relatively negative. howard mentions that he is not up for chatting and that he wants to sit quietly, which suggests fatigue, disinterest, or distress.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention
the statement ""let my life flash before my eyes"" is a significant indicator. this phrase is often used metaphorically to indicate a sense of impending doom, regret, or deep reflection, and not in a literal sense. the sarcastic undertone is implied by the dramatic phrasing compared to the mundane action of just sitting quietly.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2
the surface sentiment (negative and disinterested) matches the deeper, dramatic flair of the true intention (metaphorically signaling a negative or reflective state). the exaggerated drama in the metaphor implies that howard might be using sarcasm to express his tiredness or frustration.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

- the surface sentiment seems regretful (""darn"") and considerate (""i'd ask you to join us"").

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""darn"" could imply disappointment. the conditional statement ""if you weren't busy"" can be interpreted in two ways: as a genuine statement or as implying that the busyness is an excuse.
- **language style:** sheldon might be using ""darn"" as a way to express fake disappointment to emphasize that he either doesn't care or actually prefers that the person is unavailable.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears genuinely regretful, but the conditional nature and choice of words could hint at sarcasm.
- the use of ""darn"" might be a strong indicator of sarcasm given sheldon's typical behavior (if considering his character in ""the big bang theory"").

- the phrase ""making boom-boom in the potty"" is being compared to winning a nobel prize, which is an incongruous comparison. the nobel prize is a highly respected honor, while ""making boom-boom in the potty"" is a mundane, trivial activity.
- the use of a childish phrase in conjunction with a serious accolade suggests a rhetorical device, specifically irony or sarcasm.
- the speaker appears to be mocking the idea of awarding a nobel prize for something trivial, thereby criticizing someone or something they consider undeserving of praise.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the stark juxtaposition between the esteemed nobel prize and the trivial activity of ""making boom-boom in the potty"" strongly suggests the use of sarcasm.
- the sentence does not intend to genuinely praise the act of using the toilet, but rather to mockingly devalue it by associating it with a prestigious award.

the surface sentiment appears somewhat intellectual and explanatory. the sentence discusses changing the title of a work to make it more understandable for a general audience and mentions a concern regarding others' perception.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the statement ""i dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say i was a witch"" uses hyperbole and appears to mock the reasoning and beliefs of the ""more religious"" people. this suggests that sheldon is making a sardonic comment about people's misunderstanding of his work.

        ","given the potential for nuanced dialogue, a step-by-step analysis is beneficial here:

1. **what is the surface sentiment?**
    - the surface sentiment of the statement ""we've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment"" can be considered neutral or slightly negative. the phrase ""kind of"" indicates some level of vagueness or understatement, and ""experiment"" often implies testing or something uncertain and potentially negative.

2. **what is the true intention?**
    - the phrase ""five-year experiment"" could be interpreted as a rhetorical device, potentially downplaying a significant relationship or long-term commitment by referring to it as an ""experiment"" instead of something more committed or serious. this could suggest a nuanced form of sarcasm. it hints that the relationship did not follow typical social expectations, perhaps implying dissatisfaction or humor at an unconventional situation.

3. **compare and analyze step 1 and step 2:**
    - the surface sentiment (neutral or slightly negative) does not clearly communicate enthusiasm or overtly positive/negative feelings. however, the true intention suggests a possible ironic or sarcastic undertone, as referring to a long-term relationship in scientific or experimental terms diminishes its perceived seriousness or conventional attributes.

given the context and analysis, there is a subtle layer of sarcasm present.

### step 1: surface sentiment
- **clues:**
  - ""my limbic system wants to take your pants off.""

- **sentiment:**
  - the surface sentiment is ostensibly romantic or sexual, given the direct and somewhat scientific expression of desire.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - ""limbic system"" is a scientific term referring to the set of structures in the brain that deal with emotions and drives. 
  - the use of a technical term to express a sexual desire is unusual and could imply humor or sarcasm.
  - the statement juxtaposes the biological term with a colloquial expression, which can indicate a playful or humorous intent.
  - no direct evidence of exaggerated emotions, indirectness, or oppositional meaning presented.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment suggests a straightforward expression of desire.
  - however, the choice of language (technical term) introduces an element of humor that might lean towards sarcasm.
  - the divergence between the scientific term and the colloquial intent can be seen as intentionally incongruous.

- sentimental phrases: ""under the weather"" suggests that bernadette is not feeling well, typically a neutral or negative sentiment. ""under my dentist"" is an unusual phrase and doesn’t have a clear sentimental meaning based on common expressions.
- surface sentiment: mixed because ""under the weather"" is a neutral/negative but ""under my dentist"" is confusing and potentially humorous.

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: the phrase ""under my dentist"" likely uses humor or exaggeration. it plays on the standard phrase ""under the care of"" and twists it for comedic effect.
- language style: howard often employs humor and exaggeration. the statement about his mom being ""under my dentist"" is likely meant to be a funny exaggeration or joke.
- true intention: the sentence humorously indicates that both bernadette and howard's mom are preoccupied in different ways. the use of ""under my dentist"" implies dealing with something unexpected or awkwardly humorous.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment's mixed/negative feeling doesn't quite capture the eventual humorous twist revealed in the true intention.

### step 2: true intention
howard is likely using these enthusiastic statements to express the opposite sentiment. the repetition and exaggeration in ""i haven't heard enough about it all week"" and ""hearing about that never gets old!"" indicate that he is actually tired of hearing about the party all the time.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows exaggerated enthusiasm, while the true intention reveals annoyance or sarcasm about hearing too much about the party. this incongruence between the enthusiastic tone and the true feeling of being fed up indicates sarcasm.

2. **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - ""all right"" is often used to convey acceptance or acknowledgment. there are no specific rhetorical devices or exaggerated language in this statement that suggest a deeper, sarcastic meaning. the tone appears straightforward, devoid of irony or mockery.

3. **comparison and analysis (step 3):**
   - the surface sentiment is neutral, and the true intention seems to align with the surface expression of acceptance. there are no discrepancies or hyperbolic cues that would indicate sarcasm.

- the phrase ""amy, i can't just ask wil wheaton to leave"" seems straightforward and factual.
- ""he's a minor celebrity. once you explain who he is, many people recognize him."" contains a mix of factual information and a subtle hint of diminishment with the term ""minor celebrity.""

### true intention deduction (step 2):
- the term ""minor celebrity"" could indicate sarcasm, as calling someone a ""minor"" celebrity could be a way to downplay their actual importance or fame, implying that they are not that famous.
- the follow-up statement ""once you explain who he is, many people recognize him"" suggests that wil wheaton is not widely known without an explanation, further hinting at a downplaying of his fame, which can be seen as sarcastic.

### comparison and analysis (step 3):
- the surface sentiment appears to be factual and slightly diminishing.
- the true intention, given the context and the subtle language, indicates that sheldon might be downplaying wil wheaton's fame intentionally, pointing towards sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""couldn't live without"" suggests a high level of affection or dependency, typically positive.
- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: the inclusion of ""well, me and ben and jerry"" is critical. ben and jerry refer to a brand of ice cream, which introduces a humorous element and hints at irony. the phrase suggests that ben and jerry's ice cream, not just howard, was essential in cheering her up.
- true intention: the statement implies that while howard may have a role in cheering her up, ice cream was equally or more significant in doing so, thus downplaying howard's importance in a humorous or ironic way.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (positive, howard bringing happiness) does not align with the true intention (ironic downplay of howard’s role in favor of ice cream). the gap between what is said and what is meant suggests sarcasm.

the phrase ""milk that cow"" is a metaphor that implies someone is continuing to take advantage of a situation or exploit something for an extended period. the rhetorical question and the metaphor suggest sheldon is not expecting a literal answer but is instead criticizing someone for milking the situation. this is a rhetorical device that is often used in sarcastic expressions.

chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

        ","### response:

step 1: the surface sentiment appears harsh and insulting, indicated by keywords such as ""dumped"" and the phrase ""did he use a forklift?"".

step 2: the true intention seems to be to mock the situation or the person involved by using exaggeration. the phrase ""use a forklift"" implies that the person being dumped is very heavy, which is hyperbolic and clearly meant as a joke rather than a serious comment.

step 3: comparing and analyzing steps 1 and 2, the exaggerated and mocking tone suggests that the speaker (raj) is not serious and is employing sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

### step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""trust me, you're not jewish"" and ""that's how they get you"" could indicate skepticism or a warning. ""trust me"" suggests a form of assurance or insider knowledge. the phrase ""that's how they get you"" has an accusatory tone, implying deceit or a trap.

### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, howard's words seem to convey a sarcastic skepticism. the statement ""trust me, you're not jewish"" might be implicitly questioning someone's identity or faith, suggesting that it is unbelievable or unimportant in the context implied by ""that's how they get you."" this could be interpreted as a sarcastic remark on how people are perceived or treated based on their identities.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, there is a dissonance that suggests sarcasm. the superficially negative tone, combined with the possible incredulity and implicit questioning of identity, points to a rhetorical device, indicating sarcasm.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

the surface sentiment seems to be a mix of casualness and a protective inclination towards an emotional situation. leonard mentions being ""cool with surprises"" which indicates a relaxed attitude; however, expressing a clear aversion to crying on a jumbotron suggests discomfort.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence ""i'm cool with surprises. but nothing on a jumbotron. i don't want to cry on a big screen like that."" suggests a juxtaposition between leonard's initial acceptance of surprises and his strong opposition to having an emotional moment publicly displayed. this opposition and the specificity about crying on a jumbotron introduces a playful hyperbole, showing his true intent of avoiding public emotional display.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
while the surface sentiment carries casual acceptance of surprises, the explicit detail of not wanting to cry on a big screen introduces an exaggerated concern that can be interpreted as a humorous expression of his true feelings. there is a subtle use of exaggeration rather than a direct contradiction that is typical for sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative. the phrase ""creepy in the rearview mirror"" suggests a sense of discomfort or unease, and the mention of putting up a camera could imply a need to monitor something unsettling.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means
howard’s comment seems to imply that the situation was already ""creepy"" before he installed the camera, potentially using sarcasm to emphasize how obvious or unnecessary the camera was due to the already existing creepiness.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2
the surface sentiment (negative) and the true intention (highlighting obvious creepiness, likely using sarcasm) seem to align in terms of negativity. however, the hyperbolic expression and context suggest that howard is being sarcastic to make a point about the situation being obviously creepy.

step 3: the surface sentiment and the true intention align in their negativity. there isn't a disparity that would suggest sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it?"" clearly describes a frustrating or annoying situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""i'm sure she finds it charming"" suggests that the speaker is being insincere. it is highly unlikely that someone would actually find being stuck behind a bus charming, indicating sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the negative situation of being stuck behind a bus and the speaker's use of ""finds it charming"" in an insincere context suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic to emphasize the opposite—that the situation is actually annoying or frustrating.

- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

sheldon: can we talk about something else? do you know that i yodel?

### steps:

1. **surface sentiment analysis (step 1):**
   - the phrase ""can we talk about something else?"" appears to exhibit a sense of discomfort or disinterest in the current topic. the follow-up question, ""do you know that i yodel?"" is unexpected and shifts the conversation abruptly.

2. **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - sheldon is likely using the unexpected nature of ""do you know that i yodel?"" to divert the conversation from an uncomfortable or unpleasant topic. the abrupt shift to a bizarre subject (yodeling) suggests an attempt at humor or to deflect.

3. **comparison and analysis (step 3):**
   - the surface sentiment of disinterest and the bizarre shift to yodeling can be seen as sheldon employing a form of sarcastic or exaggerated redirection to make a point about the undesirability of continuing the current conversation. the true intention behind such an abrupt and out-of-place statement often includes sarcasm, reflecting a mocking or jesting tone towards the initial topic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase ""it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now"" contains elements of introspection and discomfort. keywords like ""hard"" suggest a negative or difficult sentiment.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in expressing a feeling of discomfort without any hint of irony, exaggeration, or insincerity. the sentence is direct and earnest.

the phrase ""i can't believe we wasted all that time on our hulk costumes"" features keywords like ""wasted"" and ""can't believe,"" which suggest disbelief and a sense of regret or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
examine the language for rhetorical devices or tone: the use of ""i can't believe"" often indicates sarcasm, especially when paired with ""wasted time,"" implying that the effort put into the hulk costumes was ultimately deemed unnecessary or pointless. this exaggeration suggests a sarcastic undertone.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment indicates frustration and disbelief, which aligns with the true intention of expressing that the time spent on hulk costumes was not worthwhile. the exaggerated tone and negative sentiment suggest a sarcastic undertone.

### conclusion:
the sentence is sarcastic because the surface sentiment of disbelief and frustration aligns with the true intention of criticizing the wasted effort, and there is a clear indication of sarcasm.

        ### step-by-step analysis:

        #### step 1: surface sentiment
        - keywords/emphasis: ""insult to her faith"", ""always thoughtful"".
        - surface sentiment: on the surface, howard appears to be suggesting that insulting someone's faith is a thoughtful gesture, which is contradictory.

        #### step 2: true intention
        - rhetorical device: the statement employs sarcasm.
        - language style: the phrase ""always thoughtful"" is used ironically, as insulting someone's faith is generally considered rude and insensitive, not thoughtful.
        - howard’s known tendencies: if howard is known for his sarcastic or ironic remarks, this further supports the interpretation of sarcasm.

        #### step 3: comparison and analysis
        - surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows an absurd suggestion of being thoughtful by insulting someone's faith, contrasting sharply with the true intention, which is to highlight the inappropriateness of the action.
        - inference: the clear mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

- the exclamation ""ooh"" implies excitement or enthusiasm.
- the casual mention of beer and clues suggests a playful or lighthearted tone.

### step 2: true intention

- checking the fridge for clues inside a beer is an unusual and illogical action, suggesting that penny might be making a joke.
- the contrast between the serious action of looking for clues and the casual, everyday object (beer) increases the humor.
- penny’s humor here might be intended to mock or make light of the situation by introducing an absurd element.

### step 3: compare and analyze

- on the surface, the sentence sounds playful and lighthearted.
- the true intention, indicated by the illogical and playful nature of the statement, adds a layer of humor.
- considering the context and penny’s likely intent to joke about the situation, there is a strong indication of sarcasm or a playful mock.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: what are these? claws?

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""what are these? claws?"" uses a direct question format. there are no immediate sentimental phrases or emojis present. the keywords ""claws"" suggest something sharp or beastly.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).
- this juxtaposition between the mundane observation and the exaggerated implication suggests sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""if you're really serious about that"" sets up a conditional statement that may sound supportive on the surface. however, the phrase ""exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat"" contains words that appear dismissive and derogatory (""old"" and ""fat"").

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention is likely not to provide actual career advice but to mock or belittle the seriousness of someone's statement or intention. the use of ""exciting opportunities"" followed by ""home care for the old and fat"" is a clear mismatch and uses an ironic tone to diminish the importance or credibility of what has been previously said.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment uses terms that could be construed as advice or suggestions. however, the actual intention, revealed through the use of mismatched and demeaning phrases, indicates sarcasm. the extreme disparity between the purported seriousness and the actual derogatory suggestion highlights sarcastic intent.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

        ","let's analyze the statement step by step:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment is slightly humorous and indicative of frustration or exasperation. 
- the phrase ""there they go, fighting again,"" suggests a recurring situation where individuals are arguing or in conflict.
- the mention of ""sauvignon blanc"" introduces an element of humor, as it is unlikely that a person would talk to a type of wine in the same way they would to another person.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention can be assessed through the use of irony. amy implies that the person in question would not behave in a hostile or argumentative manner towards something as non-confrontational as a bottle of wine.
- this contrast between human interaction (conflict) and the absurd idea of arguing with a bottle of wine highlights the exaggerated nature of the statement.
- the use of a specific type of wine (sauvignon blanc) instead of just ""wine"" or ""a drink"" further emphasizes the ironic tone.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment's slight humor and frustration align with the true intention of emphasizing the absurdity and irony of the situation.
- the disparity between the seriousness of the argument and the absurd example (talking harshly to a wine) points towards a sarcastic undertone.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

### response:

### step 1: surface sentiment
- **clues:**
  - okay, sit down.
  - listen, emily
- **sentiment:**

  - penny appears to be aiming for a serious and straightforward conversation.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - both surface sentiment and true intention align as serious and straightforward.
  - there is no discrepancy between what is being said and what is meant.
  - the statement is serious and lacks the elements typical of sarcasm where the literal and intended meanings diverge.

- **sentimental tone:** the statement starts with a positive acknowledgment (""you're both gorgeous"") and ends with a somewhat unsettling observation (""kind of says something about the man who could bed you both"").

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""kind of says something about the man who could bed you both"" could be interpreted as a backhanded compliment or a subtle jab. it's aimed at the man rather than the women, implying something unflattering about him.
- **language style:** there’s a hint of irony because while appearing to compliment the women, it could simultaneously be a critique of the man. the word ""true"" at the beginning might be reinforcing sincerity, but it could also set up for irony.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears flattering towards the women but shifts focus to a potentially derogatory remark about the man. this disconnect and the potential irony suggest sarcasm.

chandler: yeah, she couldn't live without the chan love.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""couldn't live without,"" ""chan love""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""couldn't live without"" suggests a high level of affection or dependency, typically positive.
- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive affection) aligns with the true intention (valuing chandler's love). there isn’t a significant gap between what is said and what is meant.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

- **rhetorical devices:** the sentence employs irony by suggesting that bernadette's relationship has had a negative impact on the field of robotics. however, it likely intends the opposite—that bernadette's contribution is significant, or at least that her relationship with raj is insignificant to robotics.
- **language style:** the use of ""boy"" and the context suggest a playful tone, indicating that raj is making a humorous remark rather than a serious comment.

### comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment is negative due to the phrase ""took a hit"".
- the true intention, considering the playful tone and context, is likely to humorously imply that bernadette leaving the field (or being distracted) didn't actually harm the robotics field or it highlights her significant presence and contribution in an exaggerated fashion.
- given this contrast, raj is being sarcastic by stating the opposite of what he actually means for comedic effect.

the phrase ""it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now"" contains elements of introspection and discomfort. keywords like ""hard"" suggest a negative or difficult sentiment.

there are no rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that imply a sarcastic tone. the language used is straightforward, describing a genuine emotion of difficulty or embarrassment when facing the person mentioned.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in expressing a feeling of discomfort without any hint of irony, exaggeration, or insincerity. the sentence is direct and earnest.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

- keywords and phrases: ""no one wants to see"" indicates a negative sentiment toward the idea presented.

- the phrase uses hyperbolic imagery by picturing a well-known scientist, neil degrasse tyson, in an unusual and unlikely scenario (wet t-shirt, bent over the hood of a porsche).
- the language is exaggerated and employs comedic effect, which can be a strong indicator of sarcasm.
- the absurdity and specificity of the image suggest that the speaker is likely not making a serious point and instead using irony to create humor or emphasize a contrasting point.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be positive. words like ""pretty cool"" suggest a positive evaluation. 

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- upon closer inspection, the phrase ""it could be a toupee, but either way, it's pretty cool,"" seems to imply a humorous or mocking undertone. the comparison between a ""tribble"" (a fictional, fluffy creature from star trek) and a ""toupee"" (a wig) introduces a humorous contrast which may not be entirely serious.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment (positive) does not fully match the true intention (potential humor or mockery). the comparison and the light-hearted tone suggest that the speaker might be sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
sheldon: darn. if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the statement includes ""darn,"" which indicates mild disappointment.
- ""if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us"" sounds like a polite regret or an exclusion.

**step 2: true intention**
- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly disappointed.
- sheldon’s known tendency for sarcasm and the context suggest a hidden, sarcastic meaning, as he is likely masking his true feelings behind a veneer of politeness.

- leonard mentions someone being flirty without their engagement ring, which suggests a situation of potential misunderstanding or impropriety.
- the use of ""apparently"" and ""awfully flirty"" implies judgment or criticism.
- there is a hint of confrontation or frustration in the description of events.

### step 2: true intention
- leonard is likely frustrated or upset about the situation.
- the structure of the sentence, using indirect references (""someone being flirty,"" ""another someone""), implies a pointed message without directly naming individuals, which can be a hallmark of sarcasm.
- the overall tone, combined with the detailed narrative of the situation, suggests that leonard is making a sarcastic remark about the incident's absurdity.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment indicates a problematic or controversial situation described with a judgmental tone.
- the true intention seems to convey frustration or mockery about the situation through indirect language and implied criticism.
- given leonard's tone and language choice, it is likely that he is being sarcastic.

the surface sentiment appears to be affectionate and nostalgic. phrases like ""i'm listening to you snore"" and ""i'm wondering how i'll ever sleep without it"" suggest a sense of endearment and attachment.

### step 2: true intention
however, considering sheldon's known behavior and typical use of dry humor, the statement likely employs irony. he's indicating that the person’s snoring is anything but endearing, and the true intention is to express his irritation or frustration with the snoring in a backhanded way.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""and here i am in the trap"" suggests a feeling of being stuck or trapped.
- the sentence ""you just keep talking"" implies frustration or annoyance.
- the phrase ""i'm gonna chew my leg off"" is a dramatic and exaggerated reaction, typically expressing extreme desperation or frustration.

#### step 2: true intention
- howard's use of exaggerated language, such as ""i'm gonna chew my leg off,"" is not meant to be taken literally. this hyperbole highlights his frustration and desperation about being in an unpleasant situation (being stuck in a conversation).
- the true intention appears to convey that howard feels trapped in an unwanted conversation and wants to escape it.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the contrast between the exaggerated, dramatic sentiment in the surface level and the actual situation (being in a conversation) reveals a sarcastic tone.
- the dramatic expression used by howard serves to emphasize his frustration humorously, indicating sarcasm.

- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.

the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of concern and exaggeration. keywords and phrases like ""risk of infection,"" ""blood clot,"" and ""barn spider lay eggs in your nose"" seem to express concern with a tone of exaggeration.

#### step 2: true intention
sheldon is known for using hyperbolic statements and sarcasm to make a point or to belittle someone in a humorous way. the exaggerated scenario of a surgeon letting a barn spider lay eggs in someone's nose is highly unlikely and serves to create a sarcastic tone.

the surface sentiment shows exaggerated concern, but the true intention seems to be sarcasm, as the scenarios sheldon describes are implausible and meant to induce humor rather than serious warning.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keyword: ""love"" 
- sentimental phrase: ""love that you're too good""

the word ""love"" typically carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""too good to pee in the kitchen sink"" is unusual for expressing genuine admiration. 
- the context suggests that peeing in the kitchen sink is socially unacceptable behavior, and saying someone is ""too good"" for such behavior likely implies that they might engage in it under normal circumstances, which doesn't genuinely align with admiration. 
- the exaggerated praise of being ""too good"" for a simple, obvious behavior (like not peeing in the kitchen sink) points toward sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the initial phrase ""i love"" suggests a positive sentiment on the surface.
- however, the true intention seems to mock the person for needing praise for not performing an obviously inappropriate action, indicating sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""all good things must come to an end"" is a common saying that typically acknowledges the conclusion of positive experiences.
- **sentiment:** the phrase generally conveys a sense of resignation or acceptance, often with a hint of melancholy.

step 2: true intention
- **analysis of rhetorical devices and language style:** the context, including the character sheldon who is known for his unique way of speaking, might suggest a level of irony or sarcasm. additionally, the phrase’s formulaic nature can sometimes be used sarcastically to indicate that the speaker doesn't actually believe ""good things"" are ending.
- **intention:** given sheldon's personality and context, it's possible his use of this common saying could be sarcastic, especially if he is known to use formal or clichéd expressions in an ironic manner.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of acknowledging the end of a good experience contrasts with sheldon's potential sarcastic take on the situation, given his personality and context. this mismatch suggests underlying irony.

howard: it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase ""it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now"" contains elements of introspection and discomfort. keywords like ""hard"" suggest a negative or difficult sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
there are no rhetorical devices or exaggerated language that imply a sarcastic tone. the language used is straightforward, describing a genuine emotion of difficulty or embarrassment when facing the person mentioned.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in expressing a feeling of discomfort without any hint of irony, exaggeration, or insincerity. the sentence is direct and earnest.

**conclusion:**
the sentence is not sarcastic because the sentiment expressed on the surface aligns with the true intention, and there is no indication of sarcasm.

        ","**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase ""doesn't professor abbott's family want any of this stuff?"" can be interpreted in two ways based on context. on the surface, it appears like a straightforward question.

**step 2: true intention**
the key to detecting sarcasm here lies in the context and the phrasing. the use of ""doesn't"" at the beginning and the specificity of ""want any of this stuff"" could imply that the speaker is surprised or disbelieving. this could suggest the presence of sarcasm if the family indeed should want the stuff but hasn't taken it, which implies some level of rhetoric or exaggerated disbelief.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
both readings of the sentiment and true intention raise the possibility of sarcasm. if we assume there is no context indicating the family is genuinely indifferent, the phrasing leans towards a sarcastic disbelief.

**conclusion:**
the sentence is likely sarcastic because the phrasing suggests an underlying tone of disbelief or criticism about the family not wanting ""any of this stuff,"" indicating that the speaker finds the situation unexpected or illogical.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).

   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive"").

to deduce the true intention, we need to consider the context and whether there might be a rhetorical layer to the question. the question might imply that taking someone to office depot is a trivial or unnecessary task, suggesting a critical or mocking undertone. if asked in a context where taking someone to office depot is seen as absurd, this hints at sarcasm.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of the question is neutral, but the underlying implication could carry a sarcastic tone. the question could be mocking or downplaying the importance of taking someone to office depot, considering it as an obvious, futile, or non-sensical reason.

   - **analysis of rhetorical devices and language style:** there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as hyperbole, contradiction, or exaggerated tones. the repetition of ""please"" further supports a genuine plea rather than mockery or irony.
   - **intention:** the speaker seems to be making an earnest request, driven by genuine emotions rather than employing sarcasm.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - both the surface sentiment (a plea) and the true intention (an earnest request) align.
   - there is no contradiction or underlying irony between what is said and what is meant.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""i've, uh,"" ""created some other user accounts,"" ""so i can post positive comments about their paper.""
- **sentimental tone:** the tone appears to be somewhat awkward or hesitant, as indicated by ""uh,"" but the rest of the statement appears to be straightforward about creating user accounts.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""i've, uh, created some other user accounts"" suggests an awareness of unethical behavior, using ""uh"" to soften the admission. this indicates discomfort or possible self-awareness about wrongdoing.
- **language style**: the language style here does not inherently carry a contradictory or ironic tone, but the use of ""uh"" can sometimes imply an understatement or a confession of something dubious.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment shows a straightforward, albeit hesitant, declaration about creating fake accounts. however, the true intention behind this act seems to be ensuring the paper gets positive comments in an underhanded way. the mismatch between the apparent awkward admission and the seriousness of the unethical behavior suggests a potential for sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears straightforward and neutral. raj is simply stating a fact about stuart picking out throw pillows.

the true intention might involve detecting subtle context or social dynamics. if the backstory includes stuart being unlikely or uncharacteristic to pick throw pillows, this could imply a sarcastic tone. without such context, it remains neutral.

given the sentence alone, it seems factual and lacks overt indicators of sarcasm. however, context is crucial to detect sarcasm. based on this isolated sentence, raj's statement would likely hold a straightforward, non-sarcastic intent.

- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""wandered the desert for 40 years,"" ""took that long to walk it off.""
- surface sentiment: the statement initially appears to reflect a serious explanation of why a group of people (howard's people) wandered the desert for 40 years.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: howard uses irony by suggesting that it physically took 40 years to walk off the wandering, which is an exaggerated statement.
- language style: the phrase ""took that long to walk it off"" implies that the 40-year wandering was simply a matter of physically needing that time to walk, which is an absurd simplification of the historical/religious context.
- known tendencies: given howard's typical humor style (from ""the big bang theory""), he often uses sarcasm and irony to make light of situations or historical facts.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment suggests a serious explanation, while the true intention is to highlight the absurdity of the situation humorously. 
- inference: the exaggerated nature and simplification in the statement indicate sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

howard: all right, amy's in charge of pricing and being 75.

### step by step analysis

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface statement suggests that amy is responsible for two tasks: pricing and ""being 75.""
- the literal interpretation makes no immediate sense as ""being 75"" is unrelated to pricing or any typical task.

**step 2: true intention**
- it's highly unlikely that someone can be ""in charge of being 75"" because age is not a task or role one can take on.
- the phrasing heavily implies a humorous or sarcastic twist. howard appears to be exaggerating, possibly implying that amy might be acting like an elderly person or handling tasks in a way that is characteristic of someone much older.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears straightforward until the nonsensical ""being 75"" part is analyzed.
- the true intention seems to mock or humorously exaggerate amy's role or behavior.
- the stark difference between the literal meaning and the implied humor confirms the use of sarcasm.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

the surface sentiment appears to be neutral. the statement refers to a hypothetical situation in which the speaker doesn't have a friend to tell them something important.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the phrase ""and if i had a friend, they might have told me that"" suggests that the speaker is implying that they do not have any friends. this is likely an example of sarcasm, where amy is emphasizing their loneliness or the fact that someone failed to inform them of something by sarcastically stating an overly hypothetical situation.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment is neutral but implies a degree of sadness or frustration. the true intention, revealed by the rhetorical device of sarcasm, indicates that the speaker is likely being sarcastic to make a point about feeling uninformed or isolated.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative. the phrase ""put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit"" has an aggressive and unpleasant connotation.

### step 2: true intention
analyzing the language and tone, it seems like the speaker, howard, is using a metaphor (""pop it like a zit"") to describe a potentially distasteful or uncomfortable action. the absurdity and crudeness of the metaphor could imply a sarcastic undertone, suggesting that the speaker doesn't actually expect the listener to follow this advice seriously.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment (negative) and the deeper meaning (likely sarcastic intent), it aligns more with sarcasm. the crude metaphor and the unlikely expectation point toward an insincere suggestion meant to mock or criticize.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

the phrase ""wow, there's a denny's in vegas you can actually get married in"" contains the word ""wow"" which can indicate surprise or amazement. however, the context of the statement might suggest astonishment, possibly mixed with disapproval or mockery.

### step 2: true intention
the statement likely employs irony or satire. the astonishment at the idea of getting married in a denny's in vegas implies that such a situation is unusual or unconventional to the point of being ridiculed. the true intention appears to be mocking the triviality or absurdity of getting married in a fast-food chain's restaurant.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment of surprise and amazement (""wow"") when paired with the context (marrying in a denny's) indicates a misalignment with the true intention, which is likely scornful or mocking. this mismatch is a key indicator of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- chandler uses expressions like ""do a little dance,"" ""make a little love,"" and ""get down to that.""
- these phrases are generally associated with positive or celebratory activities.

### step 2: true intention
- chandler’s character is known for his use of sarcasm and humor.
- the phrase ""i guess he wants to do a little dance, you know, make a little love"" seems to downplay or mock the seriousness or intent behind someone's actions, turning it into something trivial or exaggeratedly romantic.
- the follow-up ""well pretty much get down to that"" reinforces the idea that chandler is making a humorous commentary by framing someone's likely mundane actions in a dramatically overstated way.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- on the surface, chandler’s words seem playful and light-hearted.
- however, knowing chandler’s consistent use of sarcasm, the disparity between the exaggerated positive phrasing and the likely mundane reality suggests a sarcastic intention.
- the juxtaposition of mundane actions with romantic/celebratory phrasing is a classic chandler method of injecting humor through sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: let me think! let me think! oh, i don't care.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""let me think!"" repeated twice, followed by ""oh, i don't care.""
- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

- keywords/emphasis: ""you have to stop the q-tip when there is resistance.""
- surface sentiment: on the surface, this sentence appears to be giving a practical piece of advice about using a q-tip.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: chandler is known for using sarcasm. the advice seems overly simplistic and obvious.
- language style: the straightforward delivery of a commonsense advice, particularly from a character known for sarcasm, suggests it may not be meant to be taken literally.
- chandler’s known tendencies: chandler frequently employs sarcasm. the delivery of a piece of advice that seems to be pointing out something very obvious indicates sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment indicates advice, whereas the true intention is mocking the person for needing such an obvious piece of advice.
- inference: the disparity between the literal advice given and the condescending nature implies sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- the literal meaning suggests that chandler wants to be ""looking for my keys"" if he goes first, possibly hinting at the afterlife.
- the surface sentiment appears light-hearted and humorous.

### step 2: true intention
- common sense tells us that talking about the afterlife is often done in a more serious context.
- the phrase ""looking for my keys"" is an everyday, mundane activity, which contrasts sharply with the gravity of going first, presumably in terms of death or similar serious events.
- this contrast suggests a use of irony and a joke to make light of a heavy subject matter.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is humorous and light-hearted, while the true intention involves using humor to address a serious topic.
- the mismatch between the light-hearted surface sentiment and the serious underlying topic, combined with the playful use of mundane activities, indicates sarcasm.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""in prison!!"" being stated with such emphasis in response to a confirmation suggests a discrepancy between the affirmation and the undesirable outcome (prison). this indicates irony as the excitement about something being ""in prison"" contrasts with the generally negative connotation of prison.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement and affirmation (""yes yes it is!"") clash with the negative and ironic reality (""in prison!!""), making the statement sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment:
- the phrase ""but younger than some buildings!"" is a comparative statement. the tone is seemingly lighthearted, and the phrase ""younger than some buildings"" indicates an unusual comparison with an inanimate object (buildings), which aren't typically used as a point of reference for age.

### step 2: true intention:
- by comparing someone's age to buildings, chandler is likely employing a humorous and exaggerated rhetorical device. buildings are generally old, so the comparison implies that the subject (whoever chandler is referring to) is quite old, but still younger than some buildings. this exaggeration indicates a playful or sarcastic tone, as it's not a serious observation or assessment.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment is a humorous comparison that downplays age by referring to a relatively ridiculous standard (buildings). this mismatch—using buildings, which are very old, to describe someone's supposed youth—suggests sarcasm, as it humorously exaggerates the situation to highlight how old the person might feel or appear.

- **sentimental tone:** generally flat with a possible hint of an advisory tone.

- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""that's how they get you"" could be interpreted as a casual or serious assertion but doesn't inherently carry a sarcastic tone.
- **language style:** the language doesn't show a clear contradictory or ironic style that typically defines sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""i'd miss you if i broke up with you. just trying to be supportive."" seems to have conflicting elements. the first part ""i'd miss you if i broke up with you"" appears to express affection or care, but the context of a breakup introduces ambiguity. the follow-up ""just trying to be supportive"" adds a layer of complexity, suggesting an attempt at kindness or reassurance.

### step 2: true intention
the language and structure here are important to note. the initial statement ""i'd miss you if i broke up with you"" can be seen as somewhat absurd because it combines an affectionate sentiment with the context of a breakup, which typically is a negative event. the closing ""just trying to be supportive"" does not seem to align well with the sentiment of potentially breaking up, adding to the absurdity. this mismatch suggests that the true intention might not be straightforward support but rather a sarcastic comment on the ludicrousness of the situation.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment presents a seemingly contradictory mix of affection and breakup, ostensibly meant to be supportive. however, when considering the sentence as a whole, the exaggerated combination and the somewhat out-of-place follow-up suggest a tone of sarcasm. the disparity between the sentiment of missing someone and the scenario of a breakup hints at a sarcastic undertone, rather than a genuine expression of support.

### conclusion:
the sentence is sarcastic because the surface sentiment and the true intention do not align consistently, and the structure and content of the sentence imply an underlying sarcastic tone.

Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- keywords: ""no thanks"", ""just had an m&m"".
- sentimental phrases: ""no thanks"" is a polite refusal, and ""just had an m&m"" suggests the speaker is not hungry.

### step 2: true intention
- refusing additional food by saying ""i just had an m&m"" appears to be an exaggeration, as one m&m is an insignificant amount of food. this can indicate a use of sarcasm, implying that the speaker is not interested in more food for reasons not actually related to being full from one m&m.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment of politeness in ""no thanks"" and the trivial nature of ""just had an m&m"" create a juxtaposition. this suggests it is unlikely the speaker is genuinely using the reason of having just one m&m for refusing more food, employing sarcasm to humorously convey disinterest.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

   - **sentiment:** the surface sentiment appears to be a plea or request, suggesting concern or worry.

2. **step 2: true intention**

   - **intention:** the speaker seems to be making an earnest request, driven by genuine emotions rather than employing sarcasm.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**

- **keyword and phrases:** ""you can't do anything"" — this phrase by itself can be interpreted as a statement expressing an inability or lack of capability. 
- **sentiment:** on the surface, the sentiment is negative, focusing on a lack of ability.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis of rhetorical devices and language style:** the short, declarative sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on context and tone of voice.
  - if it is delivered in a straightforward, factual manner, it would not be sarcastic.
  - however, if delivered with a certain tone, such as dismissively or condescendingly, it could indicate sarcasm.
  - without additional context, the phrase often carries a sarcastic connotation implying dismissiveness or disbelief in the other person's abilities.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (negative, lack of ability) potentially contradicts the true intention (implying someone could possibly do something but is not meeting expectations).
- given the simplicity of the phrase and potential for dismissive tone, this often leans towards sarcasm.

since ""really?"" can either be a genuine question or a sarcastic remark, and in written text, sarcasm often relies on the context that we lack here, it remains ambiguous. given the ambiguity, if we lean on general conversational cues, ""really?"" often leans toward skepticism or sarcasm when the context involves something surprising, unexpected, or dubious.

### step 2: true intention
- chandler is known for his use of sarcasm and humor. the phrase ""it was someone else's subconscious"" is a nonsensical, humorous addition that could be seen as sarcastic, as it is impossible to act on someone else's subconscious. this suggests chandler is making light of the situation rather than genuinely apologizing.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

",FRIENDS,1,"
### Example:
Input:
chandler: let me think! let me think! oh, i don't care.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""let me think!"" repeated twice, followed by ""oh, i don't care.""
- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

- keywords/emphasis: ""crazy bitch!""
- surface sentiment: the phrase seems harsh and confrontational, indicating anger or strong disapproval.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: the phrase could be used in both literal and sarcastic contexts. it's necessary to consider the speaker's tone and context.
- language style: given chandler's character, the use of such a strong term could also be sarcastic to emphasize frustration in a humorous way.
- context analysis: without additional context, it's challenging to discern whether chandler is genuinely angry or using sarcasm to express exaggerated frustration.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: while the surface sentiment appears negative and angry, chandler's known tendencies lean toward sarcastic expressions, so it's likely the phrase is meant humorously.
- inference: the lack of direct context poses a challenge in reaching a definitive conclusion, but considering chandler's character, the phrase ""crazy bitch!"" may likely be used sarcastically to mock or exaggerate a situation humorously.

Steps:

**step 2: true intention**
- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly disappointed.
- sheldon’s known tendency for sarcasm and the context suggest a hidden, sarcastic meaning, as he is likely masking his true feelings behind a veneer of politeness.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

the initial sentiment appears to be positive. the phrase ""and i just won a million dollars!"" indicates a very happy or excited emotion.

### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the context and typical usage of such an expression, it becomes evident that this statement could be sarcastic. unless chandler is in a context where winning a million dollars is a real and likely event, such a declaration is often used to sarcastically express disbelief or to dismiss a situation. it's possible that chandler didn't actually win a million dollars.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the deeper meaning suggests a contrast. while the surface sentiment is positive, the likely true intention behind the statement is sarcastic. chandler is likely using sarcasm to convey an opposite meaning.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""you sure"" implies a question about certainty. depending on tone and context, it can be interpreted as genuine concern or doubt.
- **language style:** considering that the speaker is chandler, who is known for his sarcastic tone, this question could be sarcastic, suggesting that he actually doubts the person's capability to crack the code.

### Example:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: let me think! let me think! oh, i don't care.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""let me think!"" repeated twice, followed by ""oh, i don't care.""
- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""oh no,"" ""now it's not gonna make any sense""
- surface sentiment: chandler appears to be expressing concern or dismay that something will no longer be understandable.

### step 2: true intention
- language style: chandler often uses phrases that convey the opposite of their literal meaning. his concern often serves as a setup for a punchline or to downplay actual concern.
- chandler’s known tendencies: chandler frequently uses sarcasm to deal with situations. given the context and his history, there's a high likelihood that his expression of concern is sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows concern, but given chandler's habit of using sarcasm, the true intention is more likely to trivialize or mock the situation.
- inference: the surface expression of concern (""oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense"") juxtaposed with chandler's character traits strongly suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the statement includes ""darn,"" which indicates mild disappointment.
- ""if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us"" sounds like a polite regret or an exclusion.

**step 2: true intention**
- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly disappointed.
- sheldon’s known tendency for sarcasm and the context suggest a hidden, sarcastic meaning, as he is likely masking his true feelings behind a veneer of politeness.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

chandler: if that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?

### steps:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""keep kids in school"", ""what will"".
   - the surface sentiment appears to express frustration or disbelief that something intended to incentivize children to stay in school isn't effective.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** this statement employs irony by suggesting that if the current measure (whatever ""that"" refers to) fails to keep kids in school, nothing else will. the expectation set by ""if that doesn’t keep kids in school"" is that ""that"" should be effective.
   - **language style:** the use of hyperbole (""what will?"") suggests exaggeration to make a point, which is commonly seen in sarcastic remarks.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of concern or disbelief about students staying in school is contradicted by the hyperbolic and rhetorical nature of the statement, which implies that the measure in question is obviously inadequate.
   - given the rhetorical device (irony) and the context, it indicates a sarcastic tone.

- **sentimental tone:** generally flat with a possible hint of an advisory tone.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""i am so confused as to what we have been doing so far"" could imply genuine confusion. however, in the context of a conversation, especially one that might involve a sense of humor, it may also suggest a sarcastic remark. chandler often uses humor and sarcasm in his speech.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of confusion can align with a genuine statement, yet the context of chandler's usual sarcastic communication style suggests a different layer. sarcasm often involves stating something in a way that means the opposite or highlights the ridiculousness of a situation. chandler expressing confusion about what they have been doing so far could underline the absurdity or lack of direction, thereby being sarcastic.

- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

   - ""the bunny got away"" sounds neutral. there's no explicit positive or negative sentiment in the phrase itself.

2. **true intention:**
   - given that chandler bing is known for his sarcasm in ""friends,"" this seemingly neutral statement could carry a sarcastic undertone. if chandler is using his typical dry humor, the phrase “and the bunny got away!” might be said in a sarcastic tone to emphasize disappointment or frustration, depending on the context it’s said in.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment is neutral. however, considering chandler's trademark sarcasm, the true intention might likely be sarcastic, as he might be stressing the unexpected or unwanted outcome in a mocking tone.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

- the phrase ""and you are gonna make them all disappear"" could be interpreted as feigned enthusiasm.
- given context, chandler might actually be skeptical or implying incompetence, thus sarcastically indicating that the person will fail rather than succeed in making anything disappear.

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""what are these? claws?"" uses a direct question format. there are no immediate sentimental phrases or emojis present. the keywords ""claws"" suggest something sharp or beastly.

**step 2: true intention:**

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""joey's got a really bad hernia"" describes a serious medical condition, which typically requires specific treatment.
- the follow-up phrase ""nothing that a laser eye surgery won't fix"" is illogical and humorous because it incorrectly associates an eye procedure with fixing a hernia. this incorrect association and humor indicate sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: chandler often uses humor, including irony and exaggeration, to diffuse tension or make a point.
- language style: the over-the-top nature of ""his penis was too big"" is likely meant as an exaggerated, humorous remark to deflect the situation. the apology, ""i am sorry, that’s the kind of thing i do,"" acknowledges that chandler knows he's making an inappropriate joke.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment suggests humor and light-heartedness. the true intention is also to use humor, specifically sarcastic humor, to deal with an awkward or uncomfortable topic.
- the large disparity between the shocking or exaggerated nature of the initial statement and chandler’s self-aware apology indicates a clear use of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""what are these? claws?"" uses a direct question format. there are no immediate sentimental phrases or emojis present. the keywords ""claws"" suggest something sharp or beastly.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).
- this juxtaposition between the mundane observation and the exaggerated implication suggests sarcasm.

chandler: well thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it.

### steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""thank god"" is an expression often used to indicate relief or gratitude. however, there is a lack of visible relief as this expression is followed by ""your livelihood doesn't depend on it,"" which seems dismissive.

**step 2: true intention:**
- when someone says, ""thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it,"" they are often implying that, if it did, the situation or person's ability would lead to failure or difficulty. chandler is likely criticizing someone's competence or the importance of something by implying that if their livelihood did depend on it, they would be in trouble.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment appears to be relief, but the true intention is to mock or criticize. this contrast between the apparent gratitude and the underlying criticism suggests sarcasm.

chandler: oh i left them in my bulldozer .. i don't have tools!

### steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""oh i left them in my bulldozer"" employs an absurdity (people don't usually own bulldozers). the following statement clarifies chandler does not have tools. the tone presents incredulity or humor in the everyday context of forgetting tools.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given chandler's phrasing, he is indicating in a humorous and exaggerated way (a bulldozer being an improbable location) that he does not have the tools. the absurdity of having a bulldozer is used to mock the expectation that he would have the tools.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is one of humor using exaggeration.
- the true intention is to humorously highlight the fact that he does not have tools, using an over-the-top and clearly impossible scenario (keeping tools in a bulldozer) to make the point.
- the sentence combines the mundane declaration of not having tools with the exaggerated story for comedic effect, indicative of sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."" starts as an inquiry about a delay and ends with an apparent conclusion.
- keywords like ""taking so long"" and ""now we understand"" set up the premise of a delay and a resolution.

### step 2: true intention
- chandler seems to be addressing a situation where there was an expectation (the gift) followed by an unexpected outcome.
- the shift from wondering to understanding implies there was an element of surprise or disbelief about what caused the delay.
- the use of ""but now we understand you were doing this"" suggests that the resolution was unexpected or underwhelming, implying a letdown. this can indicate sarcasm, as it suggests what was being done instead was not perceived as worthy of the delay.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment indicates a change from curiosity to comprehension.
- the true intention behind the sentence leans towards disbelief or mock irritation, suggesting whatever was being done instead of delivering the gift was trivial or not worth the wait.
- this disparity hints at sarcasm, given chandler's tone implies a critical or mocking undertone regarding the perceived importance of the delay.

- **step 2: true intention:**

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:

- without additional context, it is difficult to assess the true intention with absolute certainty. however, on many social occasions, such phrasing could suggest someone dismissing an overreaction.
- the neutrality of the sentence might also point to a genuine attempt to provide an explanation for someone's behavior.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

amy: oh, screw her. she's just lucky we let her hang out with us.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

step 2: this kind of exaggerated description is a common rhetorical device used to emphasize the humor or absurdity of the situation. chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, so the exaggerated way of describing the situation indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

chandler: did i wake you?

### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**

- the phrase ""did i wake you?"" is a straightforward, neutral question that inquires if someone has been disturbed from sleep or another state of rest.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. given this context, the question ""did i wake you?"" could be interpreted differently.
- if this question is asked in a setting where the answer is obviously yes (e.g., the person is visibly just waking up or previously stated they were going to sleep), chandler might be using the question to subtly indicate the obviousness of the situation, thereby employing sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, the question appears to be a genuine inquiry.
- however, chandler's character and typical use of sarcasm suggest that he might be using the question to humorously point out the obvious.

  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

**step 2: true intention:**
- knowing chandler's character from ""friends,"" which frequently uses sarcasm, and considering the context of the activity mentioned—doing laundry all night, an activity generally perceived as mundane or boring—the statement likely indicates the opposite of genuine enthusiasm. the exaggerated repetition ""all night laundry!"" reinforces this perception.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment appears positive, expressing enthusiasm. however, considering chandler's typical sarcastic nature and the context, the true intention is likely negative, as doing laundry all night is not something most people would genuinely look forward to. this discrepancy flags the statement as sarcastic.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

        ","### response:

### step 1: surface sentiment
the keywords ""joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him"" suggest an extreme and violent reaction to a relatively minor offense. the follow-up question ""do you think that was wrong?"" implies the speaker expects the listener to side with them.

### step 2: true intention
chandler is using hyperbole to an extreme degree by mentioning killing joey over a stick of gum. the true intention is to humorously exaggerate the situation to such an absurd level that it's clear he did not actually kill joey. he's joking about overreacting to a minor issue.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows an absurd and exaggerated reaction, while the true intention is to humorously indicate the overreaction. this incongruity suggests that the statement is sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### input:
chandler: it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.

### step-by-step reasoning:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the speaker (chandler) describes an event as an ""accident"" and then provides a scenario that involves being ""across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.""
- the surface sentiment presents a direct claim followed by an exaggerated, humorous situation that is clearly impossible or absurd.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts"" introduces an absurdly detailed and unlikely scenario to emphasize the accidental nature of the action.
- chandler uses hyperbole to dismiss any suspicion of deliberate intent, suggesting that the situation genuinely was an accident.
- the language style and the inclusion of an outlandish scenario indicate that chandler is emphasizing the innocence of the situation through irony.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment mixes a factual statement (""it was an accident"") with an improbable scenario meant to deflect and ridicule the idea of intentional wrongdoing.
- the true intention is to use humor and irony to highlight the nonsensical nature of any accusation of premeditation.
- these elements combined indicate the use of sarcasm, as the exaggerated improbability is meant to underscore the innocence of the action through irony.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

#### step 2: 
**true intention:**
- the phrase ""joincidence with a c"" is a nonsensical alteration of the word ""coincidence."" given chandler's known tendency to use humor and wordplay in a sarcastic manner, this alteration is likely an attempt at humor or sarcasm.

#### step 3: 
**comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly positive because of the playful tone.
- the true intention involves the use of wordplay, which is characteristic of chandler's sarcastic humor rather than a straightforward statement.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- keywords: ""the jamestown colony of virginia"", ""king george"", ""giving us the land""
- sentimental phrases: the statement appears neutral and fact-based, providing historical information.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""king george is giving us the land"" presents historically inaccurate information, as king george did not give land to the jamestown colony (which predates his reign). this could suggest a misunderstanding or an attempt to be humorous or sarcastic.
- the statement itself seems unusual and slightly off, but doesn't strongly suggest irony or a clear negative sentiment.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- there is no stark contrast or obvious incongruity in the sentiment. there is potential for misunderstanding historical facts, which might make it seem humorous or dismissive of the actual historical context, but it doesn't strongly indicate sarcasm based on the provided sentence alone.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the statement includes ""darn,"" which indicates mild disappointment.
- ""if you weren't busy, i'd ask you to join us"" sounds like a polite regret or an exclusion.

**step 2: true intention**
- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly disappointed.
- sheldon’s known tendency for sarcasm and the context suggest a hidden, sarcastic meaning, as he is likely masking his true feelings behind a veneer of politeness.

        ","### response:

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""well, it will probably slow me down at first. but once i am used to the extra weight, i’ll get back on track."" presents itself as a neutral statement. there are no strong sentimental phrases or emojis. keywords like ""slow me down"" and ""get back on track"" suggest there's an initial hurdle but expect a recovery.

**step 2: true intention:**
- chandler is likely addressing a situation where he feels hindered by an added burden. the wording implies that he will overcome this burden in time; however, there is a subtle hint that suggests this might be harder than he's portraying or that the burden is significant.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is one of mild adversity followed by confidence. the true intention, considering chandler's likely personality (humorous and often sarcastic), may be to downplay the difficulty in an exaggeratedly positive way, indicating that he’s finding some humor in the situation.

Steps:
1. **what is the surface sentiment?**
    - the surface sentiment is positive. ""yeah!"" is an affirmative and enthusiastic response, often indicating agreement or excitement.

2. **what is the true intention?**
    - given that ""yeah!"" is a short and seemingly straightforward response, there are no strong indicators of sarcasm such as overly exaggerated enthusiasm or contradictory language. 

3. **compare and analyze step 1 and step 2:**
    - the surface sentiment (positive) matches the true intention (agreeing or expressing excitement) without any signs of sarcasm.

        ","let's analyze the given input step by step to determine if it's sarcastic or not.

### input:
chandler: a lonely grey couch. "" o look "" cried ned. and then the kingdom was his. the end.

### step 1: what is the surface sentiment?
- the surface sentiment seems to be neutral or negative. the mention of a ""lonely grey couch"" carries a somewhat somber or mundane tone.
- the phrase ""o look"" could imply excitement, but without additional context, it's ambiguous.
- the abrupt and anticlimactic conclusion ""and then the kingdom was his. the end."" suggests a possible underwhelming or unsatisfactory resolution.

### step 2: what is the true intention?
- chandler often makes sarcastic comments. the exaggerated simplicity and mundanity of the story (""lonely grey couch,"" ""o look,"" ""the end"") suggest that he's probably mocking something.
- the contrast between the dullness of the couch and the grandiose but unearned conclusion (""the kingdom was his"") seems intentional to invoke humor through unexpected contrast.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral or negative but lacks clear enthusiasm or positive sentiment.
- the true intention, suggested by the context and wording, hints at sarcasm, aiming to mock or humorously present a mundane scenario in a grandiose manner.

### Example:
Input:
amy: oh, screw her. she's just lucky we let her hang out with us.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

the initial surface sentiment appears to be informative or advisory. chandler is providing an explanation related to joe's behavior and the consequences associated with it.

### step 2: true intention
the line can be interpreted as sarcastic because chandler is making a remark that seems obvious or logically self-evident after some assumed mishap from joe. the use of ""that's why your parents told you not to jump on your bed!"" suggests that joe likely faced some negative consequence from jumping on the bed, and chandler is pointing out the predictable outcome in a mocking or ""i told you so"" tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, there is a subtle sarcasm in chandler's tone. he is not merely stating a fact but highlighting the obvious consequence of joe's action in a slightly mocking manner.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).
- this juxtaposition between the mundane observation and the exaggerated implication suggests sarcasm.

- the phrase ""i just have to do one thing, really quickly, its not a big thing ... get up"" contrasts between the seemingly small task and the dramatic final phrase ""get up"". the ellipsis suggests a build-up, and the sudden shift to ""get up"" delivered in all caps indicates a dramatic or frustrated tone.

### step 2: true intention
- chandler starts by downplaying the task as ""not a big thing,"" but then dramatically emphasizes ""get up."" this shift suggests that the task is, in fact, something significant or frustrating. 

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows a trivial task being built up dramatically. by downplaying initially and then emphasizing the action forcefully, chandler is likely using sarcasm to make a point that the task is more bothersome than initially suggested.

- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

- language style: the language is hyperbolic and ironic, suggesting the speaker is mocking the situation rather than seriously discussing it.
- character insights: chandler is known for his sarcastic and humorous expressions, often using exaggerated statements to convey his true feelings.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface emotion in chandler's statement, ""maybe it's a contest, you know? like 'collect all five.'"" seems casual and speculative. the phrase ""maybe it's a contest"" indicates consideration or pondering, and ""collect all five"" is a plausible scenario for a promotional activity, like in product marketing or a game.

### step 2: true intention
to understand the true intention, we need to determine if chandler's speculation is sincere or if he uses irony. ""collect all five"" is a well-known phrase typically used in marketing campaigns for collectibles, perhaps hinting he is making a playful or dismissive comment about an unrelated topic being trivial like a children's game.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention:
- surface sentiment is casual and speculative.
- the true intention appears to play down the seriousness of the situation by comparing it to something trivial like a promotional contest.

while chandler's comment could be taken literally, given the context and the well-known phrase ""collect all five"" (which tends to evoke a sense of triviality), it is likely used humorously or dismissively.

   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment:
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat critical or dismissive. the words ""perfect"" and ""problem"" combined with the alternatives ""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive"" imply that chandler does not agree with the term ""perfect.""

### step 2: true intention:
chandler is using irony here. by suggesting that a ""problem"" would be if the person were described as ""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive,"" chandler subtly implies that the person's self-description as ""perfect"" is far from the truth and is likely involved in problematic behavior.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:
the critical surface sentiment correlates with the ironic choice of words in the true intention. chandler's suggestion that ""perfect"" is a problem but ""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive"" would fit better is a clear use of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- by common sense, chandler is not literally suggesting that someone looks like a combination of two characters, especially using ""man slash woman."" 
- the statement likely serves to mock or tease, using an exaggerated comparison to elicit humor.
- the use of ""joey tribbiani"" and the odd combination suggests a hyperbolic joking nature typical in chandler's character on the show ""friends.""

### step 3: comparison and analysis

step 2: true intention: chandler is using hyperbole (mentioning a bulldozer) to emphasize that he never had tools in the first place. the true intention is to humorously indicate a lack of tools, rather than to provide an actual explanation.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment shows an exaggerated and humorous scenario, while the true intention is to emphasize a lack of tools through irony. this incongruence between the absurd statement and the true message suggests sarcasm.

the phrase ""no, no the actual cartoon character .. of course the balloon."" uses repetition and the phrase ""of course"" in a context that suggests the answer should be obvious, which can indicate frustration or sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
chandler is correcting someone who likely misunderstood a previous statement. by emphasizing ""no, no the actual cartoon character"" and then using ""of course the balloon,"" he's pointing out the absurdity of the misunderstanding. the use of ""of course"" is typically employed sarcastically to highlight the obviousness of something that should not have been misunderstood.

step 2: **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - the phrase can be broken into two parts: ""okay, but if he asks, i am not going to lie."" ""okay"" denotes a form of acceptance, while the second part about not lying suggests a condition or a boundary being set. there's an implied resistance to deviating from the truth, suggesting sincerity. the language used here does not employ irony or rhetorical devices that would suggest a deeper, sarcastic meaning.

- the phrase ""what are these? claws?"" uses a direct question format. there are no immediate sentimental phrases or emojis present. the keywords ""claws"" suggest something sharp or beastly.

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is a benign question, but the true intention is to highlight the absurdity or unsuitability of the object/feature dorothy is referring to by comparing it to something much more extreme (claws).
- this juxtaposition between the mundane observation and the exaggerated implication suggests sarcasm.

- the phrase ""oh, um, i don't care!"" carries a dismissive tone. the interjection ""oh, um"" suggests hesitation or feigned consideration. the keyword ""don't care"" indicates indifference.

### step 2: true intention
- given that the character chandler is known for his sarcastic style and the dismissive tone of the sentence, it is likely that the true intention is not actual indifference. instead, chandler is likely using sarcasm to convey the opposite—that he actually does care or is annoyed by the situation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of indifference contradicts the context and known personality of chandler, suggesting that the phrase is being used sarcastically. the hesitation (""oh, um"") adds to the likelihood of sarcasm by mimicking a false pretense of consideration.

chandler: you know once you are inside, you don't have to knock anymore.

### analysis:

step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment is instructive. it gives a seemingly straightforward piece of advice: that once someone is inside a place, knocking is unnecessary.

step 2: true intention
- the true intention here may involve understanding typical social norms. once a person is inside a place, it's common sense that knocking is unneeded, therefore pointing this out to someone could imply they are being unnecessarily cautious or unaware.
- the phrasing and the obvious nature of the statement imply a rhetorical device: sarcasm. the tone suggests that chandler finds it so evident that knocking once inside is futile that it serves to highlight the absurdity of the action.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral and factual but peculiar since it restates something obvious. 
- the true intention is to convey a humorous critique of someone's unnecessary actions, achieved through the irony of pointing out an obvious fact.
- the mismatch between the surface sentiment, which is factual, and the true intention, which is to mock or jest, indicates sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: 
what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- **keywords:** ""sarcastic"", ""sister""
- surface sentiment appears neutral to negative, primarily due to the word ""sarcastic"", which has negative or sardonic implications.

### step 2: 
deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- **rhetorical devices:** the sentence references a character (""dee"") from a known sitcom (""what's happening""), emphasizing her defining characteristic (""sarcastic""). 
- **language style:** chandler uses a direct and descriptive tone. there is no obvious indication of irony, hyperbole, or absurdity that would direct us to interpret the statement differently from its apparent meaning.

### step 3: 
compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention, portraying a straightforward description of a character.
- no contradiction or comedic exaggeration is evident, suggesting the statement is meant to be taken at face value.

### Example:
Input:
penny: ooh, i'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment seems to be one of mild disbelief or incredulity. the phrase ""uh, okay"" suggests chandler is taken aback or surprised.

### step 2: true intention
the statement, ""the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending trident,"" refers to a well-known joke about toothpaste ads claiming that ""4 out of 5 dentists recommend trident."" by saying the fifth dentist ""caved,"" chandler is humorously suggesting that now all dentists recommend trident. the exaggerated nature of this statement signals that chandler isn't reporting a real event but instead making a joke.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of surprise and disbelief pairs with the absurdity of the claim about the fifth dentist ""caving."" the intentional exaggeration and reference to a common advertising trope make the statement sarcastic, as it pokes fun at the idea.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's sarcastic nature from the show ""friends,"" the phrase ""your own brand of vigilante justice"" likely implies a critical tone, suggesting that the person's actions are not truly just or are misguided. the use of ""vigilante justice"" in itself can carry a negative connotation, indicating that the person's actions are outside the law or norms.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - while the surface sentiment appears neutral, chandler's established character trait of sarcasm suggests that the true intention is to criticize or mock the person’s actions. the discrepancy between the neutral surface sentiment and the likely critical true intention indicates sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears dismissive or trivializing on its own.
- however, when considering monica's exaggerated description of something ""not big"" as comparable to ""having a third nipple,"" it becomes clear that the true intention is sarcastic. the exaggeration turns the seemingly neutral statement into a sarcastic remark, implying that the subject is actually quite significant or noticeable.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs humor and absurdity, especially with the phrase ""monkey is penis genre"". it's a clear attempt to inject comedy into the conversation.
- **language style:** chandler uses a self-deprecating and playful tone, giving himself permission to make a joke in an odd context.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of humor and playfulness aligns with chandler's true intention of making a joke. such absurdity is typical of chandler's character in a comedic setting.

- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

the surface sentiment in the phrase ""my duties? all right."" appears neutral. the phrase lacks any explicit words or phrases that indicate strong emotions, either positive or negative.

### step 2: true intention

chandler's response may imply a subtle reluctance or mild irritation. the phrase ""my duties?"" with a question mark suggests he might be questioning the tasks assigned to him, possibly indicating that he is not particularly enthusiastic about them. the phrase ""all right"" could be read as begrudging acceptance.

### step 3: compare and analysis

the surface sentiment is neutral, but the true intention leans towards a mild annoyance or reluctance that is not explicitly stated. this disparity between the surface sentiment and the underlying feeling can suggest sarcasm. given the context of chandler's character, who often uses sarcasm, it adds weight to the interpretation.

what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: neutral or agreeable, suggested by the simple response ""ok!""

### step 2:
deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the sentence ""ok!"" is very brief and lacks any explicit rhetorical devices, tone markers, or context that could indicate sarcasm. however, the use of a single word like ""ok!"" can sometimes indicate sarcasm if the context suggests a dismissal or reluctant acceptance, but without further context, it's challenging to determine the true intention.

### step 3:
compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- given that the surface sentiment is neutral or agreeable and there's no additional context to suggest sarcasm, it is reasonable to label this as not sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic

step 1: the surface sentiment of ""no way!"" could be read as disbelief, surprise, or excitement, without any negative or bitter phrases.

step 2: given the context of chandler, a character known for his sarcastic humor, and the ambiguous but often sarcastic nature of the phrase ""no way!,"" it is likely that the true intention behind this statement is sarcastic. the actual meaning may be the opposite of the surprise or disbelief expressed on the surface, possibly indicating that something very expected or unsurprising has occurred.

step 3: the surface sentiment of disbelief is often used sarcastically. given chandler's known use of sarcasm, the likely alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention leans towards sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
amy: oh, screw her. she's just lucky we let her hang out with us.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
   - the context provided is minimal, but the use of ""great!"" could be sarcastic if chandler were frustrated or annoyed about a situation and masking that feeling with false enthusiasm. the phrase ""okay, here."" seems more neutral or resigned, adding to the potential that the ""great!"" is not genuine.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
   - the surface sentiment (positive) does not perfectly align with the true intention, especially if considering chandler's possibly resigned tone. usually, when someone says ""great!"" in a frustrated context, it is meant sarcastically.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

the phrase ""no!"" is short and emphatic. the use of an exclamation mark indicates strong emotion, but it doesn't provide direct clues about whether the emotion is positive, negative, or sarcastic.

**step 2: true intention**
to understand the true intention, context is crucial. without additional context, it's challenging to determine if ""no!"" is being used sarcastically or earnestly. however, ""no!"" can be used sarcastically if it is responding to something that is obviously true or blatantly incorrect.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
given the lack of context, it seems plausible that ""no!"" could be sarcastic if it follows an absurd or obvious statement. however, in the absence of further information, it's just as likely that it's an earnest expression.

**conclusion:**
without more context, the single word ""no!"" with an exclamation could be either sarcastic or not. however, given the strong emotion implied by the exclamation mark and the absence of additional indicators of sarcasm, the default assumption leans towards it being earnest.

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
   - the phrase ""yeah"" is minimalistic and doesn't contain any sentimental keywords or emotional phrases. without additional context, its sentiment appears neutral or possibly ambivalent.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
   - ""yeah"" could potentially be used in various contexts. it could signify agreement, apathy, disinterest, or even sarcasm depending on the tone and context. there are no explicit rhetorical devices or linguistic cues that strongly suggest sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
   - given the lack of additional context or explicit cues, it's challenging to accurately determine if ""yeah"" is meant sarcastically. the default interpretation of the phrase might lean towards straightforward agreement or acknowledgment without explicit indicators of sarcasm.

        ","### input:
ross: yeah. what-what should i do?

### step-by-step analysis:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - **keywords and phrases:** the repetition ""yeah"" and ""what-what"" could imply confusion or hesitation.
   - **sentiment:** the surface sentiment appears to show puzzlement or seeking help, indicating uncertainty or the need for guidance.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - **language style:** the repetition of ""what"" may suggest hesitation or confusion, which could be genuine. however, without additional context, it is also possible that the repetition is used sarcastically to indicate exasperation or disbelief.
   - **possible rhetorical devices:** the tone could vary; in different contexts, the repetition might imply frustration or mock dismay.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment shows confusion or seeking guidance.
   - the true intention might be genuine confusion or a rhetorical question asked in a sarcastic tone.

given the limited context, it is safer to analyze the likely intention based on what is provided. the statement can lean towards sarcasm if said with a certain tone, but without additional context, it's ambiguous.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- the literal meaning of the statement is questioning why gratitude or thanks would be expressed for being thrown out of an office.
- the surface sentiment appears to be disbelief or questioning, but in a way that conveys irony or resentment.

### step 2: true intention
- the underlying implication is that being thrown out of an office is not something one would typically be thankful for.
- there is a rhetorical device in use here: sarcasm. ross is using a question to emphasize the absurdity of the situation—no one would genuinely be grateful for being thrown out of an office.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the true intention is to highlight the absurdity and unlikelihood of feeling grateful for such a negative experience.

explanation:
1. **surface sentiment analysis:** the phrase ""oh hey, great, you're up"" can be interpreted as positive or neutral. the introduction of people (""rachel, this is my sister krista. krista, this is rachel"") does not convey any negative sentiment or sarcasm through sentimental phrases or keywords.
2. **true intention deduction:** the speaker is making introductions, which is a straightforward and neutral act. there's no use of rhetorical devices, exaggerated language, or any indication that the speaker means the opposite of what is being said.
3. **comparison and analysis:** the surface sentiment matches the true intention of introducing two people. there are no hints of irony, sarcasm, or mockery.

therefore, the sentence is labeled as ""not sarcastic"".",0.0

- **sentimental tone:** initially polite (""umm, excuse me"") but quickly shifts to a more assertive or final tone when denying access to food.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the metaphor ""that-that gravy train had ended"" is a rhetorical device suggesting that someone had been taking advantage of a situation and that advantage is no longer available. the repetition of ""that-that"" could imply frustration or emphasis.
- **language style:** the style combines politeness with a firm, conclusive statement. the use of ""gravy train"" indicates a casual, metaphorical tone.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment starts off politely but quickly becomes more assertive, aiming to communicate the end of an advantageous situation. the use of ""that-that gravy train had ended"" as a rhetorical device introduces an element of irony or playful criticism, suggesting a lightly mocking tone.

- **analysis of rhetorical devices and language style:** the use of multiple exclamation and question marks can indicate either genuine shock or mock surprise, often seen in sarcastic remarks. however, without additional context about the conversation or tone, it's challenging to definitively determine mockery or genuine surprise.
- **intention:** the intention could be genuine surprise, but it might also be rhetorical, meant to express incredulity in a sarcastic manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

### step 2: true intention
the language style and context of this sentence are crucial. the phrase could be interpreted as chandler mocking the idea of giving something impractical (a ticket) to a kid to play with. there is a hint of absurdity in the concept of a child wanting a ""ticket to play with,"" which could indicate sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
while the surface sentiment is neutral and inquisitive, the underlying intention, given the potential absurdity of the situation, suggests a sarcastic tone. chandler might be emphasizing the impracticality or foolishness of the idea by posing it as a serious question.

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

### step 1: surface sentiment
- joey uses the phrase ""oh sure"" and follows it with ""go with the sissy.""
- the term ""sissy"" is typically derogatory, implying someone is weak or cowardly.
- the phrase ""oh sure"" can be interpreted as a mild form of agreement but can also imply irritation or disbelief depending on the context.

### step 2: true intention
- joey is likely using sarcasm to express his disapproval or disappointment. the derogatory term ""sissy"" suggests he is mocking someone or something.
- the phrase ""oh sure"" sets up the irony, as it sounds like he's conceding but is actually conveying the opposite sentiment.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- on the surface, joey's words could be taken as a grudging acceptance followed by an insult.
- the use of ""sissy"" in a derogatory manner, combined with the initial phrase ""oh sure,"" indicates that he doesn't truly mean what he's saying. he's being sarcastic about the idea of going with the ""sissy.""

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention suggest genuine happiness without any hint of sarcasm.

        ","based on the input and analysis, here's the step-by-step process:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: the statement expresses relief or confirmation, indicated by phrases such as ""i mean"" and ""i would've.""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: the phrase ""if you hadn't initiated it i-i-i know i would've"" does suggest a sense of relief or assertiveness. however, the repetition of ""i-i-i"" and the context of explaining actions can indicate a defensive stance or an attempt to justify something. it's possible there is a bit of sarcasm if ross feels awkward or pressured to agree.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- considering the surface sentiment and the true intention, there is a possibility of slight sarcasm or defensiveness, but it's not overwhelmingly clear. the repetition of ""i-i-i"" might hint at discomfort rather than straightforward sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: yeah, she couldn't live without the chan love.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""couldn't live without,"" ""chan love""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""couldn't live without"" suggests a high level of affection or dependency, typically positive.
- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive affection) aligns with the true intention (valuing chandler's love). there isn’t a significant gap between what is said and what is meant.

- keywords: ""danger""
- sentimental phrases: the word ""danger"" typically indicates a situation that involves risk, threat, or harm, generally negative.
- surface sentiment: negative, suggesting a warning or alert to a harmful situation.

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: check for context, exaggeration, irony, or any unusual emphasis.
- language style: ross often uses a serious and straightforward manner, but can also be dramatic. the word ""danger"" in all caps can indicate a serious warning or could be used humorously if exaggerated.
- true intention: without additional context, it is challenging to determine if this is a straightforward warning or a dramatic exaggeration meant to be humorous.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (negative, warning) suggests a serious situation.
- the true intention is ambiguous without context; however, the use of all caps does suggest potential exaggeration which could imply humor or sarcasm.

the sentence seems to be expressing concern or alarm about a future reaction.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- **analysis:**
  - the exclamation mark indicates strong emotion.
  - the use of ""well"" at the beginning can sometimes indicate sarcasm or skepticism, depending on the context.
  - the speaker might be highlighting an oversight or poor decision-making by emphasizing the potential consequences of not consulting someone.
  - no explicit language suggests irony or exaggeration, but the tone may imply sarcasm by questioning the listener’s actions.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment is one of expressing future concern or alarm.
  - the true intention may be to point out the flaws in the listener’s actions sarcastically. the speaker could be implying that it was a mistake not to ask someone, and now they have to deal with the repercussions.

thus, the surface sentiment and the true intention might not perfectly align here, indicating a possible use of sarcasm.

step 2: observing the sentence more closely, the drawn-out ""i doooo"" may be interpreted as emphasizing that she indeed understands or agrees but in an exaggerated or insincere manner. this can often be a sign of sarcasm, as it seems to overstate agreement in a way that might actually imply the opposite.

what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: the surface sentiment appears to be one of curiosity and demand. the phrases ""take your shirt off"" and ""let's see what we're dealing with here"" suggest an intention to inspect or examine.

### step 2:
deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: considering the context and the phrasing, there is a strong suggestion that the person speaking is using a rhetorical device, possibly sarcasm or jest. the demand to ""take your shirt off"" followed by ""what are you doing?"" creates a sense of incredulity and mockery, typical in sarcastic remarks.

### step 3:
compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment suggests a straightforward demand, but the contextual and rhetorical analysis reveals a likely sarcastic undertone. the incredulity and potential mockery lead to a conclusion of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: you know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

### step-by-step analysis:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- rachel's statement ""just tell me how"" is neutral and direct.
- it does not contain any keywords or sentimental phrases that indicate strong emotion or sarcasm outright.

**step 2: true intention**
- the statement is straightforward and lacks complexity that would indicate rhetorical devices or sarcasm.
- there are no contextual clues that it’s ironic or that rachel is being insincere.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- given the neutrality and directness of the surface sentiment, the statement is likely a genuine request for information.
- without deeper context suggesting sarcasm, the balance of probability tips towards a non-sarcastic interpretation.

Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""really, really enjoyed it"" and ""very exotic"" superficially suggest a positive experience. however, the repetition of ""really"" could imply an exaggeration, which is often used in sarcasm.
- the term ""very exotic"" can sometimes be a euphemism for something unexpected or strange, adding a potential layer of sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the positive surface sentiment (""really enjoyed it"", ""very exotic"") might not align with the true intention if there are underlying nuances of exaggeration or euphemism.
- given the context, it is likely that the speaker is being sarcastic about the experience being ""exotic"" in a less-than-positive way.

- the language style is fragmented and a bit vague, which could potentially hint at understatement or reluctance.

- there is no strong use of rhetorical devices like irony or contradiction that would typically indicate a very clear form of sarcasm.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- since the sentence is largely neutral and doesn't contain strong evidence for either pure sincerity or overt sarcasm, the final assessment is more nuanced.
- the ambiguity in joey’s reply could lean slightly towards a subtle form of sarcasm, though it is not overt or strong.

ross uses exaggerated phrases like ""naked, greasy strangers"" and the structured buildup to ""cold beer"" to highlight his dissatisfaction with the situation. the exaggeration and specific word choice suggest that ross is employing hyperbole to express his irritation in a humorous way.

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

        step 1: the surface sentiment contains a feeling of resignation or disappointment. the phrase ""i'm never gonna get to meet her anyway"" indicates a sense of inevitability and lack of hope.

        step 2: considering joey's character and language style, it is essential to check for any rhetorical devices or a tone that may indicate sarcasm. joey is often known for his humorous and sometimes sarcastic remarks. here, the use of ""anyway"" might suggest a resignation laced with a hint of humor or irony, implying that he did not expect to meet her from the beginning.

        step 3: comparing the surface sentiment and underlying intention, the surface sentiment suggests disappointment, but joey's resigned tone and character context suggest it may be sarcastic in nature, as he might be downplaying his own expectations in a humorous manner.

- keywords: ""stop being such a wuss,"" ""come with us,"" ""watch naked girls dance around""
- sentimental phrases: ""stop being such a wuss"" suggests a negative sentiment towards someone's reluctance or cowardice. the phrase ""watch naked girls dance around"" is neutral or slightly positive depending on the context (generally hedonistic).
- surface sentiment: mixture of negative (criticism) and potentially positive (invitation to enjoy an activity).

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: the phrase ""stop being such a wuss"" is a colloquial, possibly exaggerated way to provoke or challenge someone. phoebe often uses direct and irreverent humor.
- language style: phoebe's language here is blunt and challenging, which suggests a joking or provocative tone rather than a serious one.
- true intention: the true intention seems to be to humorously encourage the person to take a risk and join in a fun activity rather than sincerely criticizing them.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (negative criticism and potentially positive invitation) doesn't fully align with the playful and light-hearted true intention. this mismatch suggests that there might be a humorous or sarcastic undertone.

by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

person: yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given'  'em out.

### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to have a light-hearted or playful tone. the request for ""a slice of cheesecake"" is a straightforward request, but ""and-and a date if you're given'  'em out"" adds a humorous twist.

#### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be a playful or flirtatious comment. the speaker is not seriously asking for a date but is rather making a joke. the phrase ""if you're given' 'em out"" indicates that the speaker is aware that asking for a date in this context is humorous and not serious.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, the playful gesture and humorous intent point towards a sarcastic tone. the speaker is blending a genuine request (cheesecake) with a humorous one (date), which is a common tactic in sarcasm.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**

   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

- ""thank you"" is a polite expression of gratitude.
- ""it's not weird is it"" seems to be seeking confirmation or reassurance.

### step 2: true intention

- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""stating the obvious"" indicates that the speaker (phoebe) finds the information redundant or unnecessary to mention.
- **language style:** the combination of acknowledging redundancy (""stating the obvious"") and expressing gratitude (""thank you"") could indicate that phoebe is being polite yet slightly sarcastic. additionally, the question ""it's not weird is it"" appears to be rhetorical, emphasizing that phoebe might already think it is weird.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the surface sentiment of ""stating the obvious"" and ""thank you"" is contrasted with the potential redundancy and slight sarcasm implied.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment in ""well, don't 'cha wanna?"" seems to be somewhat positive or inquisitive. phrases like ""well"" and the contraction ""don't 'cha"" (don't you) often indicate a conversational tone that can be friendly or curious.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention can be inferred by examining the context and the speaker's delivery. the phrase ""don't 'cha wanna"" can have a sarcastic undertone depending on the tone and context. the use of ""well"" can sometimes introduce a statement that contradicts expectations, which is a common setup for sarcasm. furthermore, the contraction ""don't 'cha"" can make the statement less formal and potentially more sarcastic when spoken a certain way.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the analysis shows that while the surface sentiment seems to be inquisitive or friendly, the true intention might carry sarcasm based on the phrasing and the potential tone. given these observations, it is likely that the phrase is sarcastic, implying that the person doesn't actually want to do whatever is being suggested.

### steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the phrase contains a hint of accusation and frustration. the use of words like ""your little breakfast adventure"" seems to suggest that something went wrong due to someone's actions.

**step 2: true intention**
the use of ""little breakfast adventure"" is likely meant to downplay or trivialize the significance of what happened, which indicates a mocking or sarcastic tone. chandler is implying that the breakfast event caused damage to the furniture, but he is saying it in a way that criticizes the other person indirectly.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
the surface sentiment shows frustration and accusation, while the true intention involves a mocking undertone through the use of specific word choices like ""little adventure."" this mismatch between expressing frustration and downplaying it simultaneously indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

the sentence ""what-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?"" does not contain any explicitly positive or negative keywords or sentimental phrases. nevertheless, ""stay married forever"" could suggest a positive or optimistic sentiment at face value.

### step 2: true intention
rhetorical devices such as repetition of ""what-wh-what"" and the context of the situation where rachel is likely responding to an absurd or surprising suggestion provide hints of disbelief or incredulity. given rachel's character in ""friends,"" the exaggerated repetition and the context may indicate that she is being sarcastic, implying that staying married forever is not a desirable outcome in that context.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is seemingly neutral to positive, as ""stay married forever"" could be taken optimistically.

the phrase ""i don't know, something girlie"" contains the word ""girlie"" which can display a dismissive or generalizing attitude. the tone seems casual and nonchalant.

**step 2: true intention**
there may be no direct sarcasm indicators, such as exaggeration or irony, in the statement. however, the phrase ""something girlie"" can imply a stereotypical or dismissive view towards what is considered feminine, which could be interpreted as sarcastic depending on the context of the conversation. the dismissive delivery could convey sarcasm, suggesting that the speaker might not actually care about the detail or is downplaying its importance.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
the casual and dismissive tone can align with hidden sarcasm, where the speaker might trivialize the subject by using the term ""girlie"" nonchalantly. the surface sentiment of casualness can mask a true intention of making light of the subject matter or not taking it seriously.

to deduce the true intention, i need to consider the context and any potential tone or context that might indicate sarcasm. without additional context, it's difficult to make a determination. however, if the tone is neutral or sincere, the true intention is likely to express genuine gratitude.

### step 3:
without further context indicating a sarcastic tone, the surface sentiment and the true intention align in their positivity.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the statement ""cover yourself up!"" seems to carry a directive sentiment. it doesn't indicate any obvious positive or negative sentiment but seems more like an instruction or command.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the phrase ""cover yourself up!"" could be seen as a genuine command or suggestion, perhaps concerning modesty, safety, or appropriateness. however, without additional context or tonal indicators, it's hard to determine if there is sarcasm. if the context were a beach or a swimming pool, it might be sarcastic. on the other hand, if it were cold or formal, it might be literal.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
given the absence of clear rhetorical devices and based solely on the text provided, it's difficult to definitively assign sarcasm. however, due to the lack of explicit sarcasm indicators, we can lean toward it being a direct command or suggestion rather than sarcastic.

### step 2:
to deduce the true intention, we note that ""ohhh!!!!"" is ambiguous without additional context. it can be an expression of genuine excitement or amazement. however, it can also be used sarcastically, depending on the situation, tone, and preceding conversation.

### step 3:
without context, it's challenging to definitively determine whether ""ohhh!!!!"" is being used sarcastically. given the ambiguity and potential for both genuine and sarcastic usage, it's not prudent to make an assumption in either direction.

Steps:

- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

the initial sentiment appears intense and somewhat confrontational. the phrase ""you had no relationship!!"" is an accusatory statement, indicating a strong and negative stance.

### step 2: true intention
analyzing the language and tone further, the statement could be interpreted both literally and sarcastically. on one hand, monica might be making a blunt, factual assertion. on the other hand, the use of ""you had no relationship!!"" with emphasis on ""no"" and the double exclamation points could indicate that monica is mocking or emphasizing the lack of a genuine relationship, potentially in response to someone claiming otherwise—a sarcastic technique.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, the presence of accusatory language combined with the emphatic tone suggests that monica's statement could be sarcastic if it’s responding to someone's claim of having a relationship. the emotional intensity and the emphasis suggest she might be mocking the idea that there was any real relationship.

- true intention: joey is likely making a humorous or playful excuse, indicating that he might not actually have something to show or is not serious about his eagerness.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (positive eagerness) does not align with the true intention (playful excuse). there is a significant gap between what is said and what is meant, indicating a possible use of sarcasm.

2. **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - ""all right"" is often used to convey acceptance or acknowledgment. there are no specific rhetorical devices or exaggerated language in this statement that suggest a deeper, sarcastic meaning. the tone appears straightforward, devoid of irony or mockery.

3. **comparison and analysis (step 3):**
   - the surface sentiment is neutral, and the true intention seems to align with the surface expression of acceptance. there are no discrepancies or hyperbolic cues that would indicate sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis (step 1)
- the phrase ""i can't believe it"" suggests surprise or disbelief.
- ""can i tell you something?"" indicates a desire to share or disclose information.
- ""i'm a little mad at him now"" indicates anger, though it is tempered by the qualifier ""a little.""

### step 2: true intention deduction (step 2)
- ""i can't believe it"" and ""can i tell you something?"" seem to build anticipation, as if leading up to a significant revelation.
- if taken at face value, ""i'm a little mad at him now"" implies mild frustration or annoyance. however, the phrase ""a little"" could be downplaying the true extent of anger, which is a common technique in sarcastic speech.

### step 3: comparison and analysis (step 3)
- the surface sentiment shows mild anger and surprise.
- given that downplaying emotions (saying ""a little mad"") can be a form of sarcasm, especially in a context of surprise (disbelief), there may be hidden layers of stronger emotions being expressed sarcastically.
- the anticipation built by ""i can't believe it"" and ""can i tell you something?"" can set the stage for a sarcastic reveal.

### comparison and analysis:
the incredulous tone in chandler's response paired with the exaggeration of protecting something from a tornado indicates that he's not genuinely inquiring about tornado protection. instead, he's using hyperbole to express disbelief or skepticism about a less dramatic accomplishment that he's sarcastically comparing to withstanding such an extreme force.

- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.

   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""you say someone's name enough"", ""they turn around"".
   - the surface sentiment seems neutral, suggesting a simple cause-and-effect relationship: saying someone's name will get their attention.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement may employ a hint of irony or exaggeration. it's an obvious observation stated as if it were a profound insight.
   - **language style:** phoebe's character is often known for quirky and offbeat remarks. this statement might reflect that, suggesting that the remark is meant to be humorous rather than literal.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment presents a factual statement. the possible humor or irony comes from the simplicity and apparent obviousness of the observation.
   - given phoebe's tendency for quirky humor, this could be seen as a playful, slightly ironic remark rather than a literal statement.

Input:
person: i was going to ask leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **clues:**
  - emotionally unstable
  - heavy machinery
- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment is cautionary and concerned.

#### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - the speaker is providing a reason for not asking leonard to operate heavy machinery.
  - mentions ""emotionally unstable"" explicitly, which suggests genuine concern about leonard's mental state affecting his ability to handle a potentially dangerous task.
  - no evident rhetorical devices like irony, exaggeration, or understatement that would lead to sarcasm.
  - direct and clear language with no hidden or oppositional meanings.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - both surface sentiment and true intention align as expressions of concern and caution.
  - there is no discrepancy between what is being said and what is meant.
  - the statement is straightforward and lacks the complexity typical of sarcasm where the literal and intended meanings diverge.

- **clues:**
  - ""and it came out""
  - ""squatternut buash?""
- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment seems to be confusion or surprise, possibly conveyed humorously.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - the phrase ""squatternut buash?"" is likely a garbled or incorrect form of speech, indicating a mistake or a humorous situation.
  - there is a playful tone in the way the mistake is presented, suggesting that the speaker might be poking fun at themselves or the situation.
  - this use of intentional or exaggerated mispronunciation suggests a light-hearted or self-deprecating humor.
  - the absence of any negative sentiment or serious tone implies that the statement is not meant to be taken literally.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment of humor and confusion aligns with the intention of being playful and self-deprecating.
  - the humorous take on a speech error indicates that the literal meaning (confusion over the phrase) and the intended meaning (self-deprecating humor) align, supporting a non-serious interpretation.
  - sarcasm typically involves saying something contrary to what one means, often with a biting or critical undertone, which is not present here.

        ","### input:
phoebe: okay?

### step-by-step analysis:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment is neutral based on the word ""okay?"" and the question mark.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the question mark can indicate various tones depending on the context. it might be neutral, but it could also be showing disbelief, confusion, or even sarcasm if phoebe is responding to something surprising or frustrating.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- without additional context, it is difficult to definitively determine the true intention. the word ""okay?"" might be interpreted sarcastically if phoebe is responding to something she finds ridiculous or frustrating.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""trust me,"" ""you're not jewish,"" ""that's how they get you.""
- **sentimental tone:** generally flat with a possible hint of an advisory tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""that's how they get you"" could be interpreted as a casual or serious assertion but doesn't inherently carry a sarcastic tone.
- **language style:** the language doesn't show a clear contradictory or ironic style that typically defines sarcasm. 

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** there is no strong contradiction between the surface sentiment of advice or declaration and the deeper intention behind the statement.

- **rhetorical devices:** the word ""interfacing"" is often used in technical contexts and might not be commonly used in casual conversations about personal interactions. this could suggest a humorous or sarcastic intent.
- **language style:** the use of a technical term in a personal context can indicate a sarcastic tone, as it contrasts with the expected informal language.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** while on the surface, the phrase might appear neutral or positive, the choice of the term ""interfacing"" in this context suggests a humorous or sarcastic undertone, implying that the interaction is more mechanical or less personal.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be one of curiosity or interest. the phrase ""you're gonna have to tell me how you did that"" suggests that the speaker is impressed or intrigued by something.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention can vary depending on the context. if rachel is genuinely impressed or intrigued by something extraordinary, the statement is sincere. however, without additional context, there's a potential for sarcasm if rachel is reacting to something mundane or obvious, implying that she finds the other person's actions unimpressive.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment (curiosity/interest) and the true intention (could be impressed or unimpressed based on context) need to be aligned. given the lack of context here, it's challenging to determine without additional information. 

however, if we consider the likely conversational usage in day-to-day scenarios and typical sitcom dialogue, it leans more towards sarcasm, implying that the action observed does not warrant such detailed curiosity.

- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive affection) aligns with the true intention (valuing chandler's love). there isn’t a significant gap between what is said and what is meant.

- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

        ","### input:
chandler: okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?

---

### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""aware"", ""unagi"", ""eel"".
- surface sentiment appears neutral or factual because it is simply a question asking about knowledge of a fact.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the question seems straightforward but considering chandler's character who often uses sarcasm, there might be another layer.
- **language style:** the phrasing ""are you aware"" can sometimes be used sarcastically, implying that the information should already be known, thus potentially diminishing the listener's competence.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral or factual, but considering chandler's known tendency for sarcasm and the potential condescension in ""are you aware,"" it is likely a sarcastic remark.
- this suggests that chandler believes the other person should already know that unagi is an eel.

### Example:
Input:
person1: look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay?

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - **keywords and phrases:** ""please, please"" is a repetition that indicates urgency or earnestness.
   - **sentiment:** the surface sentiment appears to be a plea or request, suggesting concern or worry.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - **analysis of rhetorical devices and language style:** there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as hyperbole, contradiction, or exaggerated tones. the repetition of ""please"" further supports a genuine plea rather than mockery or irony.
   - **intention:** the speaker seems to be making an earnest request, driven by genuine emotions rather than employing sarcasm.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - both the surface sentiment (a plea) and the true intention (an earnest request) align.
   - there is no contradiction or underlying irony between what is said and what is meant.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** the phrase ""paper cut!"" is brief and does not contain any overt sentiment indicators or sentimental phrases.
- **sentiment:** on the surface, it appears to be an exclamation, likely indicating an injury, but without additional context, it's difficult to ascertain the exact sentiment from the words alone.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis of rhetorical devices and language style:** chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor in the tv show friends. the exclamation ""paper cut!"" could be exaggerated, given its minimal severity compared to the reaction it elicits. such overstatement is often used for comedic or sarcastic effect.
- **intention:** considering chandler's character and typical use of sarcasm, it's likely that he is making light of a minor injury, using hyperbole to stress how insignificant it is while pretending it's a big deal.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment suggests an exclamation about a minor injury, and the true intention indicates the use of hyperbole to possibly mock the situation.
- given chandler's known sarcastic demeanor and the context, it is more likely that this statement is sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""couldn't live without"" suggests a high level of affection or dependency, typically positive.
- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive affection) aligns with the true intention (valuing chandler's love). there isn’t a significant gap between what is said and what is meant.

- keywords: ""just a sec,"" ""give me a minute,"" ""ah-ha-ha""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""give me a minute to wake up for this"" suggests that the speaker needs time to prepare or wake up, and the ""ah-ha-ha"" at the end appears to be a laugh, which could indicate amusement or irony.
- surface sentiment: the statement could be seen as neutral or slightly amused.

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: the phrase ""ah-ha-ha"" often suggests that it's not to be taken literally but rather humorously or ironically. chandler adding this laugh after a routine statement shifts the context towards a sarcastic tone.
- language style: chandler is known for his sarcastic and witty remarks. the use of ""ah-ha-ha"" in response to a simple request hints at sarcasm, suggesting that the task being requested is mundane or unimportant, but he pretends to need time to wake up for it.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (neutral/amused) doesn't entirely align with the true intention (sarcastic humor). the phrase and follow-up laughter imply that chandler is not taking the situation seriously and is likely being sarcastic.

phoebe: all right, okay, well, apparently not!

step 1: surface sentiment:
- the phrase ""all right, okay, well, apparently not!"" consists of neutral or mildly positive words like ""all right"" and ""okay."" the phrase ""apparently not"" introduces a sense of contradiction or realization, often used to express disappointment or frustration.

step 2: true intention:
- the phrase suggests that phoebe initially believed something to be true or to happen as expected and then finds out it is not the case. the use of ""apparently"" hints at an expectation being subverted. the combination of ""all right, okay"" before the realization amplifies the sense of leading up to an unexpected letdown, which can be a rhetorical device to emphasize irony or sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment is neutral or mildly frustrated, but the true intention behind this sequence of phrases suggests irony or sarcasm. phoebe's acknowledgment (""all right, okay"") followed by a sudden reversal (""well, apparently not!"") implies she initially thought one thing and then found it to be false, leading to a sarcastic tone.

step 2: true intention: chandler is using hyperbole (mentioning a bulldozer) to emphasize that he never had tools in the first place. the true intention is to humorously indicate a lack of tools, rather than to provide an actual explanation.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment shows an exaggerated and humorous scenario, while the true intention is to emphasize a lack of tools through irony. this incongruence between the absurd statement and the true message suggests sarcasm.

the keywords ""that's easy for you to say"" imply a dismissive or frustrated tone. the phrase ""you weren't almost just killed"" adds a sense of danger and trauma, suggesting that the speaker feels the statement being contradicted is trivializing their experience.

### step 2: true intention
rachel is likely using hyperbole or understatement here. by saying ""that's easy for you to say,"" she is emphasizing that the other person's perspective is less valid or informed because they did not experience the same life-threatening situation.

- **language style:** the language is simple and can be interpreted as directly dismissive. however, due to the exaggeration, there's a hint that the true intention might not be aligned with the literal interpretation.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is dismissiveness. however, the true intention could imply the opposite, suggesting the speaker might actually believe the person can do it, using sarcasm to convey skepticism exaggeratedly.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""chandler?""
- sentimental phrases: there are no clear sentimental phrases or keywords indicating positive or negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: here, ""chandler?"" could be a simple inquiry or a dismissive tone, depending on the context or delivery style.
- language style: phoebe's character often uses a quirky or humorous style, but without context, it's challenging to ascertain whether this is an instance of that style or a straightforward question.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment lacks specific directional sentiment (neither positive nor negative), and the true intention is ambiguous without additional context. it could be sincere or sarcastic based on tone and context.

given the ambiguity and lack of clear indicators, it's challenging to confidently label this without additional context. however, typically, a simple inquiry like this leans towards a **not sarcastic** label unless specific delivery cues suggest otherwise.

the surface sentiment seems to be neutral. joey is politely acknowledging thanks but is also indicating that he has a problem to deal with.

### step 2:
to deduce the true intention, consider joey's language. the phrase ""kinda have a problem to deal with here"" could be genuine, indicating that joey is preoccupied, or it could be sarcastic, suggesting that joey feels the problem is more significant than the other person realizes. there is an implication that joey's tone could swing either way depending on the context.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: there are no overt rhetorical devices like exaggeration, irony, or contradiction within this sentence. however, the context provided by the tone of voice or body language (which is not present in the text alone) could potentially reveal sarcasm. in textual form alone, there are no clear indicators of sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- based on the surface sentiment and our analysis of the true intention, we find that there are no apparent indicators of sarcasm. the request seems genuine.

- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment of this question seems to express a sense of seeking reassurance or confirmation about someone's feelings.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - the phrase is a question that could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context and tone.
  - it could be a genuine question seeking validation, or it could be sarcastic if coming from someone who feels jaded, insecure, or doubtful due to prior actions or statements.
  - without additional context, it's challenging to determine if there are rhetorical devices or a particular tone being used.
  - however, given the phrasing ""you still love me?"", there could be an underlying implication of doubt or disbelief, which might hint at sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment and true intention might align if the question is genuine.
  - if the context implies previous events that led to doubt or disbelief, the true intention could be sarcasm, expressing doubt or incredulity rather than a genuine query.
  
because the literal and intended meanings might diverge (considering the possibility it's addressing previous doubts or disbelief), there is a significant likelihood this could be a sarcastic remark.

   - given the incomplete nature of the sentence, the surface sentiment appears regretful or apologetic. the true intention also seems aligned with the surface sentiment, suggesting an acknowledgment of wrongdoing and starting to express an apology. there’s no direct evidence from this fragment alone to suggest sarcasm as there are no rhetorical devices or language styles such as exaggeration or irony being employed.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

examining the sentence carefully, there is a possibility that joey's surprise may not be entirely genuine. the use of the word ""maybe"" suggests uncertainty or an attempt to downplay the significance of the realization. moreover, exaggeration and the rhetorical device of self-doubt could be indicators that joey is being sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment in chandler's statement appears to be a mix of frustration and insistence, particularly when he repeats ""janice"" and declares that it ""wasn't about being picky.""

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
chandler's repetition of ""janice"" and the insistent tone suggest an underlying sense of frustration and resignation. the rhetorical device here might be in the defensiveness conveyed by ""that wasn't about being picky,"" which could imply that chandler is attempting to justify or rationalize something about janice.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment of frustration and insistence aligns with the true intention of defensiveness. considering chandler's tone and the context, the claim that it ""wasn't about being picky"" could be sarcastic, given that chandler often uses sarcasm in his speech, especially about topics that frustrate him like janice.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: the phrase can be interpreted both genuinely and sarcastically depending on the context. it might be genuine if phoebe is actually concluding a task, but it could also be sarcastic if the task was done poorly or if there was disbelief in its effectiveness.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### step 3: compare and analyze

the surface sentiment of the sentence ""i'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes"" appears to be neutral or straightforward. there are no strong emotional phrases or keywords indicating a positive or negative sentiment.

### step 2:
to deduce the true intention, we need to consider the context. the line is stated by ross, possibly in a situation where he is expressing frustration or irony about his inability to make it in time. the phrase ""in ten minutes"" might imply urgency or sarcasm if he is currently far from the location where he is supposed to be.

### step 3:
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention:
- surface sentiment: neutral/straightforward.
- true intention: likely expressing sarcasm about the unrealistic timeframe given the situation.

the disparity between the neutral surface sentiment and the implied sarcasm about the improbability of making it in time suggests that the statement is sarcastic.

the surface sentiment is neutral, but the true intention, considering the context of a conversation, especially from a character known for humorous and occasionally sarcastic remarks (like phoebe from ""friends""), might lean towards sarcasm. the lack of context is tricky, but the abruptness hints at a possible sarcastic undertone.

### conclusion:
given the lack of explicit context but factoring in common conversational usage and phoebe's character demeanor, i infer that the statement is likely sarcastic.

Input:
amy: oh, screw her. she's just lucky we let her hang out with us.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the sentence suggests a recommendation for taking a ""good pill.""
- the keyword ""yeah"" repeated twice may imply agreement or affirmation, but it also can indicate a dismissive tone.
- overall, the statement appears somewhat casual and dismissive.

#### step 2: true intention
- the phrase is likely utilizing a rhetorical device such as sarcasm. given the context where someone needs a ""good pill,"" it's not a typical sincere medical advice but more of a response to a situation where the actual need is probably not a pill.
- the true intention seems to be dismissive of the seriousness or gravity of whatever the person is facing, implying that the suggestion of taking a pill is not a genuine solution.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears neutral to mildly dismissive.
- the true intention, punctuated by the repetition of ""yeah,"" suggests that the speaker is not truly offering medical advice but using sarcasm to downplay the situation.
- there is a mismatch between the literal (surface) meaning and the intended (true) meaning, which indicates sarcasm.

step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
- the phrase ""nope. op, wait! there he goes"" is somewhat neutral but slightly confusing. ""nope"" indicates a negative response, ""op, wait!"" implies sudden realization or correction, and ""there he goes"" signifies observation or acknowledgment. there are no explicit sentimental keywords or emojis.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
- the combination of ""nope,"" followed by ""op, wait!"" and concluding with ""there he goes"" suggests a sequence of realization or correction. joey is likely experiencing a change in perception, indicating movement or activity. the use of ""nope"" and then quickly correcting with ""op, wait!"" suggests initial misjudgment followed by noticing the actual event.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
- looking at both steps, the surface sentiment seems to align with the true intention of accurately describing a sequence of events. there's no clear indication of sarcasm. the statement appears to be straightforward without exaggerated language or rhetorical devices that typically characterize sarcasm.

- **clues:**
  - ""take a couple deep breaths""
- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment appears to be calming and supportive, suggesting a way to relax or manage stress.

### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - the phrase is often used to suggest calming down or relaxing.
  - depending on the context, it might be offered as a genuine piece of advice or could be used sarcastically if the speaker thinks the other person is overreacting.
  - without more context, it's challenging to definitively determine if there's a sarcastic undertone.
  - rhetorical devices such as tone, previous conversation context, or known behaviors of the characters could sway the interpretation.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment is calming and supportive.
  - without further context about the conversation or joey's tone, it's difficult to deduce definitively if there is a mismatch between the surface sentiment and true intention.
  - this phrase, on its own, lacks clear indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggerated language or extreme understatement that would suggest a divergence between literal and intended meanings.

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

1. **surface sentiment analysis (step 1):**
   - the phrase ""no no, you don't have to fly back, really"" contains multiple elements that provide clues to the sentiment. the repetition of ""no"" and the word ""really"" could be seen as emphatic. however, it lacks obvious sentimental keywords or emotive phrases that strongly indicate either a positive or negative sentiment. the tone might seem neutral on the surface with a slight lean towards reassurance.

2. **true intention deduction (step 2):**
   - the repetition of ""no"" and the use of ""really"" can also suggest insistence and could be a subtle cue of underlying frustration or disbelief. this might indicate that the speaker, monica, is implying the opposite of the literal words; she might actually want the person to fly back but is trying to express it with a tone of exaggeration or mock reassessment, potentially indicating sarcasm.

3. **comparison and analysis (step 3):**
   - surface sentiment appears neutral with a hint of reassurance. however, the true intention deduced from the use of emphatic language suggests possible sarcasm. the tone and structure of the statement can lead to an interpretation that the speaker is not being entirely genuine about their reassurance.

### step 2: true intention deduction
the phrase ""well well"" is often used to draw attention or convey a sense of surprise or condescension. the whole sentence can be analyzed for potential sarcasm since ""very nice,"" while positive on the surface, can be used ironically depending on tone and context.

the phrase ""what was that?!"" is an exclamation that suggests surprise, confusion, or shock.

to determine the true intention, we need to consider whether the exclamation is genuine or if it could be making a sarcastic remark about something that was expected to be better or wasn't surprising at all. this context is crucial.

### step 3: compare and analyze
without additional context, it's difficult to definitively determine if rachel's exclamation is sarcastic or not. however, the phrase ""what was that?!"" is often used in both genuine surprise and sarcastic contexts. given the lack of specific indicators pointing to sarcasm (such as prior context or tone indicators), we should lean towards the more general interpretation.

        ","let's analyze the input step by step.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the sentence ""i wasn't by myself. i had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy."" might seem to describe having support during an event or situation, indicating a neutral to slightly positive sentiment if taken literally.

**step 2: true intention**
however, the inclusion of a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy could be seen as an exaggeration. contextually, this sentence could imply that the situation was so severe or absurd that it required such a large support team, hinting at irony or sarcasm. the follow-up question ""so, did you see who won the game?"" abruptly changes the subject, which might further suggest a sarcastic tone or minimizing the previous statement.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
the surface sentiment (neutral/""i had support"") and the true intention (potentially ironic or exaggerated situation) do not align. there is an indication of sarcasm due to the implicit exaggeration and sudden topic shift.

**conclusion**
the sentence appears to be sarcastic because the surface description of having support does not align with the probable exaggeration suggested by the necessity of a doctor, a nurse, and a helper.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase could imply emphasis or exaggeration indicating more concern than neutrality.
- **language style:** without additional context, it is difficult to detect strong linguistic cues for sarcasm. however, phrases starting with ""even if"" can sometimes be part of hyperbolic or exaggerated speech depending on how the subject is presented.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral or slightly negative due to potential concern.
- the true intention isn't definitively clear without more context, making it difficult to ascertain sarcasm with strong confidence.

### step 2: what is the true intention?
joey's statements indicate he is trying to explain why he stayed in his room, with an added humorous or self-deprecating remark about his hamper. the use of ""yeah well that's because"" suggests an excuse, and ""you don't want to look in my hamper"" adds a humorous yet negative connotation. this might indicate a deflection or an attempt to make light of a less appealing situation.

Steps:

- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- there aren't overt sentimental phrases but the tone can be deduced as somewhat accusing or confrontational.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""you'd know that, being one of the two of us"" is designed to imply that the listener should obviously know something because they are directly involved.
- the tone and structure suggest an element of sarcasm, particularly because the speaker is stating what should be obvious.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the combination of ""i guess"" with the implication that the listener should already know suggests a mocking or derisive tone.
- the overall sentiment does not line up with a neutral or genuine question, but rather a sarcastic remark emphasizing the obviousness of the knowledge.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

1. **what is the surface sentiment?**
    - the surface sentiment of ""stick to the list."" is neutral. there are no emotional keywords or sentimental phrases.

2. **what is the true intention?**
    - considering the context, the phrase ""stick to the list."" is a directive. it could be interpreted literally as an instruction to follow a predefined list, without any obvious signs of sarcasm like exaggerated frustration, humor, or contradiction.

3. **compare and analyze step 1 and step 2:**
    - the surface sentiment (neutral) matches the true intention (giving an instruction). there are no indicators that suggest an underlying sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: you know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

        ","### response:
given the text ""yes it is."", without additional context, it is challenging to confidently determine if it is sarcastic or not. i will proceed step by step to ensure the accuracy of the judgment.

step 1: the surface sentiment appears to be positive or neutral. the phrase ""yes it is."" typically indicates agreement or affirmation.

step 2: to deduce the true intention, we need to consider the possibility of rhetorical devices like sarcasm. the short and straightforward nature of the statement leaves room for interpretation based on context, tone, or previous statements. sarcasm might be intended if the statement contrasts sharply with prior discussion or if there’s a known disagreement on the matter.

step 3: without contextual clues, comparing the surface sentiment and the deduced true intention is challenging. however, we can analyze the likelihood based on typical usage. simple affirmations, when context is not considered, are often not sarcastic. yet, sarcasm may be present, especially if the tone or prior context suggested disbelief or disagreement.

given the lack of context to definitively swing the judgment, but considering the common use of affirmative phrases more often than not in a straightforward manner, there's slightly less confidence in determining sarcasm purely by text alone.

the surface sentiment of confrontation and possible criticism aligns with the true intention of mocking or sarcastically asking what happened to the person's face. both levels indicate a sarcastic tone.

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- surface sentiment: the word ""no"" generally expresses a negative response or rejection. on its own, it’s a neutral statement without context that gives any obvious clues about additional sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- true intention: without additional context, it is challenging to deduce a deeper meaning or detect rhetorical devices. ""no"" can be straightforward, but depending on the tone, context, or previous interaction, it could be sarcastic when used in a certain way. however, given the lack of context and no clear indicators of sarcasm within this single word, it is safer to assume it is not.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention analysis do not strongly indicate sarcasm. the word ""no"" by itself is ambiguous but tends to lean towards being straightforward in the absence of additional context.

        ### Label: 

        ","let's determine if the statement ""am i out of control?"" by monica is sarcastic or not.

### steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is a question. the phrase ""am i out of control?"" suggests that the speaker is questioning their own behavior or composure which on the surface, appears neutral and simply inquisitive.

#### step 2: true intention
to deduce the true intention, we need to consider if monica would be genuinely asking this question or if it is a rhetorical device. if the context involves someone challenging monica's behavior, she could be using this question sarcastically to mock the idea that she is out of control.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
given that questions such as these can often be sarcastic depending on context (""am i out of control?"" when someone is being accused rather than genuinely self-reflecting), and without additional context to clarify sincerity, there is a reasonable likelihood this could be sarcastic. however, without explicit emotional or contextual cues, a definitive judgment leans on the subtle connotations inferred from everyday communication patterns.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""let me think!"" repeated twice, followed by ""oh, i don't care.""
- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

- language style: the conditional ""if you wanna"" gives an informal tone, implying that the action (putting a label) is unnecessary or not important.

2. **true intention:**
    - joey's statement implies that he feels excluded or not given due importance, despite him being the host. it hints at a sense of being overlooked or not acknowledged properly. given the context of a common social gathering, this could be genuine confusion or mild frustration. however, without additional context showing an exaggerated tone or contradiction, it doesn't strongly suggest sarcasm.

3. **compare and analyze:**
    - the surface sentiment of mild discontent or confusion aligns with the apparent true intention of joey wanting to assert his role as the host. there are no strong indicators of sarcasm such as exaggerated tone or contradictory language.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- on the surface, the statement suggests that chandler can see something from where he is and implies a cost involving a ""husband.""
- the mention of a ""cost"" typically implies a transaction or value exchange.

### step 2: true intention
- common sense and context imply that it is highly unlikely that chandler literally means it will cost an entire ""husband"" for whatever he is observing.
- the hyperbolic nature of ""it'll cost you one husband"" suggests the use of irony or exaggeration to convey humor or disbelief.
- the sentence appears to contrast the literal meaning with an absurd or impossible scenario, indicating a rhetorical device common in sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis (step 1):
- the phrase ""no, no, no, it's flattery"" includes repetition of ""no"" which can indicate emphasis. the word ""flattery"" generally has a positive sentiment.

### step 2: true intention deduction (step 2):
- the repetition of ""no"" can imply a strong insistence or correction. depending on the context, ""flattery"" could be used sarcastically to imply that the compliment might not be sincere or that it is exaggerated.

### step 3: comparison and analysis (step 3):
- the surface sentiment includes mixed signals: ""flattery"" is positive, but the repeated ""no"" adds a complex tone. the true intention might be sarcastic, suggesting that what is being referred to as ""flattery"" might not be taken sincerely.

- dorothy's statement includes the phrase ""she is upset because they keep changing the taste of coke.""
- being ""upset"" suggests a negative emotion.

### step 2: true intention

- the idea of being upset over something as trivial as the taste of coke being changed can be seen as exaggerated.
- dorothy may be using this trivial reason to highlight that the true reason for being upset is actually more significant.
- this contrast between the trivial reason and actual emotional response can indicate sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

the phrase ""but now i have hidden her again so you can find her"" implies a playful or teasing tone. the initial part, ""oh yes blanche, about a half hour ago,"" seems like a straightforward response but doesn't correspond directly to the second part which introduces a twist. the overall tone suggests an intent to mock or tease rather than deliver factual information.

### step 2: true intention
dorothy is likely being sarcastic here. when she says she has hidden the person ""again so you can find her,"" it implies that she never actually hid anyone initially and is making a mocking statement to blanche, perhaps to imply that blanche is always searching for someone or is overly concerned.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment includes playful and teasing keywords and phrases, while the true intention reveals a mocking or sarcastic tone. this difference suggests that dorothy is not actually informing blanche that she hid someone but is using this statement to emphasize the absurdity or non-necessity of blanche's concerns or actions.

        ### Label: 

        ","given the input text ""dorothy: no i am upset because crocodin turbs are wearing darker colors.""

let’s analyze step-by-step:

step 1: **surface sentiment:**
- the phrase ""no i am upset because crocodin turbs are wearing darker colors"" hints at an unusual scenario. the concept of ""crocodin turbs"" wearing ""darker colors"" is absurd and unrealistic. the keyword ""upset"" also suggests an emotional response, but it's paired with an unlikely cause.

step 2: **true intention:**
- dorothy is likely not actually upset about ""crocodin turbs"" wearing darker colors because this idea is fantastical and nonsensical. this use of exaggeration and improbable scenarios might be a form of hyperbole to humorously convey that the actual reason for being upset is trivial or non-existent.

step 3: **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment shows an exaggerated and humorous situation, while the true intention is to mock or highlight the absurdity of the reason given for being upset. the incongruity between the expressed sentiment (upset due to something outlandish) and the logical expectation (being upset for a sensible reason) suggests the use of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

penny: ooh, i'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears frustrated or incredulous, indicated by the use of ""no"" and the specific mention of an uncomfortable situation (""112 degrees"") and a mundane activity (""eat enchiladas"").

### step 2: true intention
the statement uses irony and exaggeration. it is unlikely someone would choose to sit in extreme heat (""112 degrees"") to eat enchiladas, suggesting that dorothy does not genuinely believe this to be what will happen.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface frustration contrasts with the exaggeration of an absurd situation (choosing to sit in extreme heat for a trivial reason), indicating a sarcastic tone. the intention behind the statement is to emphasize how unlikely or ridiculous the situation is.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""cannot make any sense"", ""commercials for obsession"".
   - surface sentiment appears to be one of confusion or frustration due to the phrase ""cannot make any sense"".

step 2: **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs a hint of irony because advertising, in general, is intended to persuade and be clear, yet the speaker finds it incomprehensible. the exaggeration in inability to understand the commercials suggests a denouncement of their effectiveness.
   - **language style:** the straightforward complaint might indicate genuine confusion, but the overstatement (""cannot make any sense"") could suggest a playful jab at the complexity or ridiculousness of the commercials.

step 3: **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of confusion (""cannot make any sense"") is amplified when targeted at something meant to be influential and clear (commercials). this exaggeration hints at an ironic tone, possibly implying that the commercials are overly complex or pretentious, thus not effective.
   - this aligned with dorothy’s expression of frustration in a hyperbolic manner indicates that the statement is sarcastic rather than a sincere complaint.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: you know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

- dorothy expresses being ""depressed"" because of phillis george leaving the morning news.
- the word ""depressed"" has a strong negative connotation, indicating sadness or disappointment.


### step 2: true intention

- it is possible that dorothy could be using exaggeration to express a relatively minor frustration humorously.
- however, without more context, it's equally plausible that she's genuinely stating her disappointment.

### step 3: compare and analyze

- on the surface, dorothy's statement seems to express genuine disappointment.
- there is no strong indication of sarcasm through hyperbole, contrasting phrases, or known character traits that signal irony.
- absence of exaggeration or contrasting words suggests sincerity rather than an ironic twist.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/emphasis: ""let me think!"" repeated twice, followed by ""oh, i don't care.""
- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm typically involves saying something in a tone that is meant to convey the opposite of what the words denote.
- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.
- chandler’s known tendencies: given chandler’s established character traits, this switch is likely meant to mock the importance of whatever he was pretending to think about.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment shows a pretense of caring deeply, while the true intention is to convey indifference.
- inference: the stark contrast between the surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: sarcasm can often involve incongruity or a jarring response that doesn't match the likely context.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""no rose"", ""go to the corner and open a stand""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""no rose"" indicates a direct refusal or correction, which might carry a negative or dismissive tone. ""go to the corner and open a stand"" could be interpreted as an unusual or out-of-context instruction, which might imply a mock command or a sarcastic suggestion.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""go to the corner and open a stand"" seems out of place in regular conversation, indicating that there may be an underlying mocking or sarcastic tone.
- the emphasis through direct address (""no rose"") and the oddity of the command suggests the speaker may be ridiculing rose's previous suggestion or action.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the contrast between the abrupt correction (""no rose"") and the strange, impractical suggestion (""go to the corner and open a stand"") suggests that the speaker doesn't actually intend for rose to follow the instruction. this incongruity is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- the phrase ""lords of arabia"" can be analyzed. it refers to something grand or notable, likely implying a title, a status, or a prestigious group.
- the surface sentiment appears to be positive, grandiose, or emphasizing importance.

### step 2: true intention
- to understand if there's any sarcasm, it is important to determine whether there's any context or contradiction implied by the title.
- without additional context, it is difficult to deduce whether it is meant ironically or if there's an underlying joke.
- the phrase ""lords of arabia"" could refer to something or someone in an exaggerated or mocking fashion if the context previously mentioned something less grand or deserving of such a title.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- given only the phrase ""lords of arabia,"" it is challenging to directly infer sarcasm without context.
- the surface sentiment suggests importance or grandeur.

- the negative sentiment of the phrase paired with the exaggerative and ironic suggestion for rose to watch such a gruesome event suggests that the speaker does not expect rose to do this literally, instead conveying a sarcastic remark about a frustrating situation.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the statement includes ""darn,"" which indicates mild disappointment.

**step 2: true intention**
- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and mildly disappointed.
- sheldon’s known tendency for sarcasm and the context suggest a hidden, sarcastic meaning, as he is likely masking his true feelings behind a veneer of politeness.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement ""of course no ma, i am referring to carrey grant, he is living in the broom closet."" appears to be a denial of something and introduces the celebrity carrey grant humorously in an unlikely context (broom closet).

### step 2: true intention
- given the absurdity of the statement (carrey grant living in a broom closet), it suggests that the speaker is not serious.
- the mention of a well-known celebrity in such an outlandish scenario typically indicates the speaker is using humor, likely sarcastic in nature, to make a point.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment is humorous and light-hearted but also ridiculous in context.
- given rhetorical devices such as exaggeration and hyperbole, the statement is likely sarcastic rather than a genuine claim.

Input:
chandler: yeah, she couldn't live without the chan love.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""couldn't live without,"" ""chan love""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""couldn't live without"" suggests a high level of affection or dependency, typically positive.
- surface sentiment: positive, implying strong affection or need.

**step 2: true intention**
- analyze rhetorical devices: look for exaggeration, irony, or any language style that alters the surface meaning.
- language style: chandler often uses humorous and self-deprecating remarks. however, in this statement, there is no clear indication of intentional exaggeration or irony.
- true intention: the sentence appears to straightforwardly suggest that someone finds chandler's love invaluable.

**step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention**
- the surface sentiment (positive affection) aligns with the true intention (valuing chandler's love). there isn’t a significant gap between what is said and what is meant.

- sentimental phrases: the described actions (throwing up, passing out, relieving yourself) carry a negative connotation.
- surface sentiment: negative, implying distaste or disapproval.

### step 2: true intention
- analyze rhetorical devices: the sentence lists a series of outrageous and undesirable actions in a hypothetical scenario.
- language style: the exaggerated nature of these actions and the absurdity of the combination suggest hyperbole and irony.
- true intention: to sarcastically comment on unacceptable and inappropriate behavior.

### step 3: compare surface sentiment and true intention
- the surface sentiment (negative and disapproving) contrasts with the exaggerated manner in which the scenario is described (suggesting irony and sarcasm).

Input:

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

### step 2: **true intention**:

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

- keywords: ""show them your slides of hawaii""
- sentimental phrases: there are no explicitly sentimental phrases, but showing slides of hawaii can generally be seen as a positive or neutral activity related to sharing travel experiences.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""show them your slides of hawaii"" could indicate a sincere request to share enjoyable travel memories. however, the context and tone (which are absent in the text) are critical in determining whether this is meant sincerely or sarcastically.
- if this statement is made in a context where showing slides of a trip is usually considered boring or tedious, it might suggest sarcasm, implying that the listeners wouldn’t be interested.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- since the surface sentiment of 'slides of hawaii' seems neutral to positive and there is no overt or clear negative situation described, it is challenging to deduce sarcasm without additional context.
- given the lack of clear indicators of irony or incongruity, it is most likely a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement.

- incongruity: the mismatch between joe piscapo, a comedian, and the serious role in ""rain man"" suggests the speaker isn't genuinely upset about this casting decision. given this context, it is likely dorothy is using irony.
- irony/rhetorical devices: the statement likely isn’t about genuine upset but is rather mocking or making a joke about the idea of joe piscapo being considered for such a role.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the sentiment of being ""upset"" contrasts with the enthusiasm or surprise one might have over casting news, especially when considering the mismatch of joe piscapo for a serious role in ""rain man.""

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- dorothy uses words like ""upset"" and mentions ""jimmy swaggart can't cover his motel bill.""
- the word ""upset"" typically carries a negative sentiment, indicating someone is unhappy or distressed.

### step 2: true intention
- the mention of ""jimmy swaggart"" and ""can't cover his motel bill"" may hint at a public figure's scandal or failure, implying ridicule or criticism.
- the structure ""no, she is upset because..."" suggests a reaction to a previous context, often used in sarcasm to understate or mock the given reason.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- on the surface, dorothy is explaining a reason for someone's upset feeling.
- however, the referencing of a public figure's inability to cover a bill (likely a scandalous or humorous context) suggests a mocking or sarcastic undertone.
- given the context and phrasing, it's likely that dorothy's intention is to humorously downplay or mock the situation.

### Example:
Input:** 
chandler: ah you see perfect might be a problem. had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.

   - the surface sentiment is straightforward. the use of ""no"" suggests a negation or correction. the reference to a ""rose in the kitchen"" seems neutral and descriptive.

step 2: **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement does not seem to employ irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices typically used in sarcasm.
   - **language style:** the language is direct and clear. dorothy appears to be correcting or specifying something.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- dorothy uses phrase ""in what blanche, dog years?""
- the reference to ""dog years"" implies a sense of exaggeration or a humorous tone about the time span in question.

### step 2: true intention
- dorothy is addressing someone named blanche.
- by asking ""in what blanche, dog years?"" dorothy is humorously suggesting that the time span blanche mentioned seems extraordinarily long, thus exaggerating it to a dog years scale.
- this exaggeration is a form of irony, implying that blanche's sense of time is dramatically off.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- surface sentiment: humorous exaggeration with reference to ""dog years.""
- true intention: to humorously undercut blanche’s sense of time, suggesting it feels excessively long.
- given the context and this analysis, dorothy is likely using sarcasm to tease blanche about her perception of time.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- the literal meaning is that rose is defending dorothy by suggesting that something indeed sounds like something dorothy would do.
- the surface sentiment appears apologetic yet supportive of dorothy.

### true intention
- the word ""defence"" and the phrase ""it sure sounds a lot like her"" might imply exaggeration, suggesting that dorothy typically does things that are hard to believe or out of the ordinary.
- there seems to be an underlying tone that hints at irony, as defending someone by saying something “sounds a lot like her” in response to something odd is not a strong defence but rather an implicit critique.

### comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is supportive yet resigned, suggesting a pattern of behavior attributed to dorothy.
- the true intention reveals irony, as the defence is weak, implying that dorothy often does questionable things.

step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion appears excited or enthusiastic, indicated by the exclamation ""ooh"" and the casual, almost playful tone about looking for clues.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""clues inside a beer"" uses irony and humor. checking a fridge for clues inside a beer is an absurd and unlikely activity, suggesting penny isn't genuinely searching for clues but rather hinting at wanting to have a beer.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface excitement contrasted with the ridiculousness of finding clues inside a beer reveals a sarcastic tone. the playful nature and absurdity of the concept indicate it's not to be taken literally, confirming the sarcastic intent.

dorothy: a hand puppet rose.

step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears neutral, stating ""a hand puppet rose"" without additional emotional indicators or expressive language.

step 2: **true intention**: the phrase ""a hand puppet rose"" could potentially imply a criticism or a diminishment of rose's actions or importance, using the metaphor of a hand puppet to convey that rose's behavior is controlled or unimportant. without further context, it's ambiguous whether it's highlighting something literal, or if it's implying that rose is being manipulated like a puppet.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: this statement could be seen as subtly belittling or critical, depending on the context. however, without additional context to confirm a sarcastic tone, the direct reading of this statement seems more literal and neutral.

Input:
leonard: said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""horrible things"", ""all in all"", ""pretty magical night"".
- sentimental phrases: ""horrible things"" carries a negative connotation, whereas ""pretty magical night"" carries a positive connotation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""said horrible things about each other in public"" clearly describes a negative situation.
- the follow-up phrase ""a pretty magical night"" is incongruous with the prior negative situation, indicating a use of irony—a key component of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

dorothy: no rose, that you should do.

### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""no"", ""rose"", ""you should do"".
- sentiment clue: the word ""no"" can suggest a contradiction or disagreement but does not inherently carry a strong sentiment without context.

**step 2: true intention**
- the phrase ""no rose, that you should do"" seems to dismiss something rose suggested or did, implying it is more appropriate for rose to handle it herself.
- the structure and phrasing can suggest that dorothy might be emphasizing that rose specifically should take responsibility for something, which can be interpreted as sarcastic if the underlying context indicates an expectation contrary to rose doing something herself.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- without additional context, the phrase itself lacks strong emotional or sentimental clues.
- however, the emphatic suggestion that rose should do something she might have been avoiding or was unexpected to do herself implies an underlying irony, hinting at sarcasm.

chandler: this is so good, that i am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. i can enjoy my view, whilst i enjoy my dessert.

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

**step 2: true intention:**
- given the context, dorothy is likely facing something not actually claws but is comparing them sarcastically to claws. this indicates a rhetorical device where she is emphasizing how rough or unrefined something seems.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

the statement ""no, no no, i just mediate the group. i just give up every tuesday of my life to help these screwups for the good of my health"" contains keywords and phrases that suggest frustration and exasperation. the phrase ""give up every tuesday of my life"" and the term ""help these screwups"" carry a negative connotation. the closing phrase ""for the good of my health"" is likely sarcastic, as it implies that the action is not actually beneficial to the speaker's health.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention behind the statement seems to be to convey exasperation and dissatisfaction with the task of mediating the group. the phrase ""for the good of my health"" is used ironically to suggest the opposite—that the activity is actually burdensome and not beneficial to the speaker.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the incongruence between the literal meaning of ""for the good of my health"" and the context of giving up time to help ""screwups"" indicates sarcasm. the surface sentiment is one of exasperation disguised as a seemingly positive statement, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.

member-girl: we thought you were just here for the company. he is a sarcasmoholic stewart.

### response:

step 1: **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""here for the company"", ""sarcasmoholic"".
   - the use of the term ""sarcasmoholic"" suggests a humorous tone. 

step 2: **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement uses hyperbole (""sarcasmoholic"") and potentially sarcasm.
   - **language style:** the term ""sarcasmoholic"" is a humorous or exaggerated way to indicate that stewart often uses sarcasm. the statement ""we thought you were just here for the company"" is likely not meant to be taken literally given the context.

step 3: **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment seems light-hearted but the use of ""sarcasmoholic"" combined with the preceding sentence strongly suggests the presence of sarcasm.
   - given that stewart being labeled as ""sarcasmoholic"" implies he frequently uses sarcasm, the opportunity of the situation itself being sarcastic is quite high.

### Example:
Input:
chandler: you know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**

- chandler uses the words ""amusing"" and ""regular.""
- the word ""amusing"" typically indicates something funny or enjoyable.
- the word ""regular"" usually means something ordinary or mundane.

**step 2: true intention**

- chandler often uses sarcasm and understatement to convey his true feelings.
- the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is likely an understatement to enhance humor.
- the contrast between ""amusing"" (which implies high enjoyment) and ""regular"" (implies something boring or normal) suggests an ironic intent.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- on the surface, chandler uses neutral to mildly positive words.
- however, the true intention is to humorously understate his reaction, implying that what others find amusing, he finds dull.
- this disconnect between surface sentiment and true intention, combined with chandler's known character traits, signals sarcasm.

- the phrase ""noooo. really?"" uses elongated ""o"" in ""noooo"" and the word ""really?"" which could be interpreted as indicating surprise or disbelief.

### step 2: true intention
- the exaggerated length of ""noooo"" and the rhetorical question ""really?"" suggests that member-boy is not genuinely surprised but is using these phrases to mock or express skepticism.
- this is a common tactic used in sarcasm, indicating that the speaker actually finds what was stated to be obvious or unworthy of such surprise.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- on the surface, member-boy's words express disbelief.
- however, the exaggerated disbelief points towards a sarcastic tone, as it implies that what was said is not surprising at all.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the stark contrast between the negative sentiment of experiencing verbal conflict (""horrible things"") and the positive phrase ""a pretty magical night"" suggests the speaker does not mean the night was actually magical, but is rather being sarcastic to emphasize how bad the night actually was.

- knowing sheldon’s character, the audience should consider his frequent use of sarcasm and dry humor.
- the phrase ""if you weren't busy"" suggests that the speaker is implying the listener's busyness as a reason for not inviting them, though sheldon might not actually want their company.
- there's a possibility that sheldon never intended to ask the person to join.

### Example:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

- the sentiment seems emotional and potentially disappointed or frustrated, indicated by the elongated ""noo"" and trailing "".."".

**step 2: true intention**
- without context, it is challenging to ascertain the exact intention behind ""noo.."". however, elongated expressions can sometimes be used to emphasize the sentiment more dramatically.
- the elongation and trailing "".."" suggest an emphasis on the negativity, which could be for dramatic effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment indicates a strong negative reaction or disapproval.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive"").

2. **true intention:**

   - **language style:** given chandler's known sarcastic nature, the context suggests that this might not be a sincere offer for a break, but rather a sarcastic comment to point out that the other person is being overly dramatic.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

- surface sentiment: chandler initially appears to be in deep thought or considering something important due to the repeated phrase.

- language style: the abrupt shift from a seemingly serious consideration (""let me think!"") to dismissal (""oh, i don't care."") indicates a sarcastic tone.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""well, i'm a headhunter. i hook up out of work soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. hi rasputin!"" includes a description of a job that seems far-fetched and unlikely.
- keywords like ""headhunter"", ""out of work soviet scientists"", ""rogue third-world nations"" and the greeting ""hi rasputin!"" contribute to a humorous and exaggerated tone.

### step 2: true intention
- chandler is likely not serious about his job being a headhunter for soviet scientists and rogue nations.
- the mention of ""hi rasputin!"" further adds to the comedic exaggeration, suggesting he’s making a joke to emphasize the absurdity of his statement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is a humorous and exaggerated job description, which doesn’t align with reality.
- the true intention is to make a joke about an impossible or ridiculous profession.
- this juxtaposition between the exaggerated and the true intent indicates sarcasm.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- chandler uses the phrases ""let me think! let me think!"" and ""oh, i don't care.""
- ""let me think!"" repeated twice suggests someone is considering options seriously.
- ""oh, i don't care."" indicates indifference or lack of concern.

**step 2: true intention**
- chandler is known for his sarcastic humor.
- the repeated phrase ""let me think! let me think!"" builds up the expectation that he is seriously contemplating something.
- the sudden switch to ""oh, i don't care."" suggests a dismissal of all the buildup, which is a common technique in sarcasm to highlight the lack of seriousness.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- on the surface, it appears that chandler pretends to contemplate something important.
- however, his true intention is to mock the idea that he would spend time thinking about something he ultimately finds trivial.
- this contrast between the expectation set up by ""let me think!"" and the casual dismissal of ""oh, i don't care."" signals sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment: the keywords ""oh i left them in my bulldozer"" indicate an absurd or highly unlikely scenario, especially following the statement ""i don't have tools!"". there's a hint of exaggeration and irony.

step 2: true intention: chandler is using hyperbole (mentioning a bulldozer) to emphasize that he never had tools in the first place. the true intention is to humorously indicate a lack of tools, rather than to provide an actual explanation.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment shows an exaggerated and humorous scenario, while the true intention is to emphasize a lack of tools through irony. this incongruence between the absurd statement and the true message suggests sarcasm.

- keywords: ""no thanks"", ""josephine"".
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""no thanks"" is neutral or slightly negative, depending on context; it is a polite declination. the name ""josephine"" doesn't carry particular sentiment in itself but can be context-dependent.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""no thanks"" typically indicates a polite refusal.
- adding ""josephine"" at the end can imply some familiarity or attempt to add emphasis or humor.
- the context in which chandler says this phrase is uncertain, but if ""josephine"" is used in an ironic or playful manner, it could suggest sarcasm, especially if the name isn't relevant to the actual person's name.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- there is a slight sense of irony or playfulness in addressing someone as ""josephine"", especially if it is not their name, indicating a sarcastic undertone to the otherwise straightforward refusal.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial sentiment appears to be negative. phrases like ""oh, screw her"" and ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" indicate a contemptuous or dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and tone, it becomes evident that amy's words are expressing frustration or disdain toward the mentioned person. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole or irony that would suggest the sentiment is meant in an opposite or sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning, both align in a negative context. amy seems to genuinely hold a negative view about the person and is voicing a straightforward opinion without an underlying sarcastic tone.

chandler: oh my god, where are all the men?

### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial surface sentiment seems puzzled or exclamatory. the phrase ""oh my god"" expresses a sense of surprise or exasperation. 

#### step 2: true intention
to deduce the true intention, let's focus on the context and rhetorical devices. chandler's exclamation ""oh my god, where are all the men?"" suggests he is commenting on an unexpected absence of men. considering the use of the phrase ""oh my god"" which can often highlight disbelief or irony, it is likely chandler is using exaggeration to mark a supposed rarity or unexpected situation, hinting at sarcasm.

#### step 3: compare and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the deeper meaning:
- surface sentiment: surprised, exasperated.
- true intention: likely pointing out an ironic situation where a place expected to have men does not, revealing a disparity between expectation and reality, characteristic of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
dorothy: no, i haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the literal meaning suggests that dorothy has not yet performed the action of taking someone or something out of the trunk of the car.
- the surface sentiment appears nonchalant and factual.

**step 2: true intention**
- common sense implies that it is unlikely someone would leave a person or important item in a car trunk, especially if asked about it.
- the phrasing implies a rhetorical device called irony, where the literal statement contrasts sharply with logic or common behavior. this disparity suggests an undertone of exaggeration or absurdity.
- the word ""yet"" signals a degree of casual dismissal or joking discomfort, punctuating the unlikelihood of the literal action being true.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral but peculiar, leading to an expectation of improbability in literal actions.
- the true intention is to convey the absurdity or impossibility of the situation, highlighting a sarcastic undertone.
- the mismatch between the surface meaning and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- chandler is likely reacting to a situation that is not actually serious but is exaggerated to seem so. the expression ""struck down in the prime of life"" is overly dramatic, suggesting that he does not genuinely believe the situation merits such a description.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is a dramatic and seemingly serious statement.

#### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical device: hyperbole or exaggeration might be at play here. also, the phrase could indicate a whimsical or ridiculous activity.
- language style: considering chandler's known tendencies for humor and sarcasm, this unusual statement is likely exaggerated for comedic effect.
- chandler’s known tendencies: chandler often uses absurd or humorous statements to make light of situations, which can be a form of sarcasm or comedic relief.

    - the surface sentiment is positive. ""yeah!"" is an affirmative and enthusiastic response, often indicating agreement or excitement.

2. **what is the true intention?**
    - given that ""yeah!"" is a short and seemingly straightforward response, there are no strong indicators of sarcasm such as overly exaggerated enthusiasm or contradictory language. 

3. **compare and analyze step 1 and step 2:**
    - the surface sentiment (positive) matches the true intention (agreeing or expressing excitement) without any signs of sarcasm.

step 1: **surface sentiment**: the surface emotion seems to be longing or wishful thinking, expressed by the phrase ""gee, if only"". however, the phrase carries a tone that can suggest something more than just wishful thinking.

step 2: **true intention**: chandler's comment ""if only she were one and had no idea what a birthday was"" is intended to point out the absurdity of expecting someone who is not one year old and does understand birthdays to act in a similarly ignorant manner.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**: the surface sentiment may seem wistful, but it drastically contrasts with the underlying meaning. chandler is using irony to highlight the ridiculousness of the notion. the real intention is to mock or critique the situation described, indicating a sarcastic tone.

the surface emotion appears neutral or casually inquiring. this is indicated by the straightforward question ""are you still enjoying your nap?""

### step 2: true intention
the question seems genuine on the surface, but it could also be interpreted sarcastically depending on the context. for instance, if chandler asks this question while someone is obviously not napping or has been disturbed, it implies sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
without additional context, it's difficult to ascertain the true intention definitively. however, given chandler's character and conversational style, there's a reasonable chance this could be sarcasm, especially if the nap has been interrupted.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
- **step 1: surface sentiment:**
  - the keywords and phrases like ""this is so good,"" ""gonna enjoy,"" and ""enjoy my view"" indicate a positive sentiment on the surface.

- **step 2: true intention:**
  - considering chandler's well-known sarcastic nature from the character's context in ""friends,"" phrases that seem overly enthusiastic and repeated use of ""enjoy"" can suggest exaggeration. this style of exaggeration is characteristic of sarcasm where the real meaning is quite the opposite.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis:**
  - the surface sentiment is highly positive. however, the true intention, when factoring in chandler's personality and the over-the-top phrasing, is likely to convey the complete opposite—a negative or indifferent sentiment. this discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention flags the sentence as sarcastic.

- **clues:**
  - emotionally unstable
  - heavy machinery
- **sentiment:**
  the surface sentiment is cautionary and concerned.

#### step 2: true intention
- **analysis:**
  - the speaker is providing a reason for not asking leonard to operate heavy machinery.

  - no evident rhetorical devices like irony, exaggeration, or understatement that would lead to sarcasm.
  - direct and clear language with no hidden or oppositional meanings.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison:**
  - both surface sentiment and true intention align as expressions of concern and caution.
  - there is no discrepancy between what is being said and what is meant.
  - the statement is straightforward and lacks the complexity typical of sarcasm where the literal and intended meanings diverge.

step 1: surface sentiment: the keywords ""oh i left them in my bulldozer"" indicate an absurd or highly unlikely scenario, especially following the statement ""i don't have tools!"". there's a hint of exaggeration and irony.

step 2: true intention: chandler is using hyperbole (mentioning a bulldozer) to emphasize that he never had tools in the first place. the true intention is to humorously indicate a lack of tools, rather than to provide an actual explanation.

step 3: comparison and analysis: the surface sentiment shows an exaggerated and humorous scenario, while the true intention is to emphasize a lack of tools through irony. this incongruence between the absurd statement and the true message suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords:** ""perfect"", ""might be a problem"", ""co-dependent"", ""self-destructive"".
   - surface sentiment appears confusing since ""perfect"" generally has positive connotations, whereas ""problem"", ""co-dependent"", and ""self-destructive"" are negative.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the statement employs irony and contradiction by juxtaposing ""perfect"" (a positive adjective) with problematic terms like ""co-dependent"" and ""self-destructive"".
   - **language style:** the word choice and context suggest that the speaker (chandler) doesn't literally see ""perfect"" as a problem but is highlighting the absurdity or exaggeration for comedic effect.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of ""perfect might be a problem"" is contradicted when paired with extreme negatives (""co-dependent"" or ""self-destructive""). 
   - this contradiction, combined with the playful and exaggerated tone, indicates that chandler is being sarcastic, not serious.
