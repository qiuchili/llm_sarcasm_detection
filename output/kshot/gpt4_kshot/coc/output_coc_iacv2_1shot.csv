### Example:
Input:
""but...but...   i just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. now i'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   as to driving...don't care.   what i'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. there's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. you saying they can't do that?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

### step-by-step analysis:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""obviously not.""
  - ""mind you...""
  - ""such heroism""
- the phrase ""obviously not"" indicates a strong initial disagreement.
- ""mind you"" is often used to draw attention to a new point, sometimes to highlight a contradiction.
- ""such heroism"" implies praise but given the context, it may be ironic.

**step 2: true intention**
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the statement uses logical reasoning to point out a perceived inconsistency.
  - the phrase ""such heroism"" seems to be used ironically, questioning whether the pro-life movement truly supports the difficult choices mothers may have to make.
  - the overall tone suggests criticism rather than genuine admiration, implying a contradiction in the pro-life stance.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment shows disagreement and potential irony.
  - the true intention is a critique of the pro-life position, leveraging irony to highlight what the author perceives as an inconsistency or hypocrisy.

**inference:**
- given the use of ""such heroism"" ironically and the overall critical tone, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### reasoning:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  the surface sentiment of the input text is informative and explanatory. it appears to be aimed at clarifying misconceptions about atheism and explaining how atheists can appreciate intangible qualities just as theists do. keywords and phrases such as ""please review,"" ""cannot be observed,"" ""abstract and intangible quality,"" ""being an atheist does not preclude belief,"" and ""just precludes the belief in god"" suggest a calm, explanatory tone.

- **step 2: true intention**
  the true intention is to educate and clarify the concept of atheism without mocking or ridiculing anyone. the speaker explicitly addresses misunderstandings and provides a logical explanation regarding intangible qualities and beliefs, aiming to correct any misinformation and provide a balanced understanding.

- **step 3: analysis**
  both the surface sentiment and the true intention focus on factual correction and explanation without any elements of sarcasm. the language is straightforward and lacks any humorous, exaggerated, or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm. the intent is clearly to inform and clarify.

hence, the appropriate label for the given text is ""not sarcastic.""",0
So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?,0,"
### Example:
Input:
i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a sincere expression of agreement and understanding. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and possibly skeptical. phrases like ""so a theory was revised..."" followed by a rhetorical question ""does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?"" indicate a potentially critical or mocking tone.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the language style in the sentence suggests the use of a rhetorical question to imply something indirectly. by questioning whether a revised theory means it was wrong afterward, it seems to imply that the revision doesn't fundamentally discredit the theory, hinting at a counter-argument to the assumption that revision equals being wrong.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment and the true intention together suggest a critical undertone that may not be straightforward. given the use of rhetoric and implied meaning, there is a strong indication of sarcasm as the statement seems to mock the oversimplified view that revision of a theory implies its incorrectness.

- the keywords and phrases include ""locked up,"" ""bar the door,"" ""arrested,"" and ""completely legal.""
- the phrase ""apples and oranges"" is a figure of speech indicating two incomparable items. 
- the comparison between two scenarios—physical assault leading to imprisonment and same-sex marriage not resulting in arrest—creates a weighted juxtaposition.
- the phrase ""yes, it's completely legal for you to do that, right now,"" can imply an underlying tone in context.

### step 2: true intention

- the juxtaposition of severe legal repercussions for physical violence with the legality of same-sex marriage implies a contrast meant to highlight disparity.
- ""yes, it's completely legal for you to do that, right now"" seems to carry an implicit critique, comparing the gravity of the two scenarios and possibly suggesting something about the values or logic behind the law.
- the statement ""apples and oranges"" confirms the disparity and possibly the speaker's view that these comparisons are fundamentally different and perhaps unfairly considered equivalent.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the surface sentiment employs factual statements about legal consequences but adds subjective commentary.
- the true intention reveals a critique through a rhetorical comparison, highlighting irony in societal or legal responses.
- the alignment of these elements suggests sarcastic commentary.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""almost as silly as...""
- the use of ""silly"" and the comparative phrase ""almost as... as"" often suggest a mocking or belittling tone.
- there is a slight sarcastic undertone when discussing controversial topics like gay marriage.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the phrase ""almost as silly as"" employs irony by comparing two situations in a mocking way, indicating that the speaker finds the idea being discussed absurd.
  - this sort of comparison is often used to mock or sarcastically criticize an idea by drawing a parallell to another idea perceived as equally ridiculous.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical perspective and a tone of ridicule.
  - the true intention is to mock the idea that gay marriage could undermine heterosexual marriage, suggesting that both the discussed notion and its comparison are equally absurd.
- **inference:**
  - given the mocking tone, use of irony, and the comparison to a generally ridiculous notion, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

Input:
""but what about the hypothetical?i can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural. so, what i was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture. that's why i brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. i think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the 'logical' brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. but faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and 'make sense' to more than one person, these specific 'explanations' can be passed down. so i don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text is neutral and analytical. it discusses ideas and asks a thought-provoking question without emotional or exaggerated language. there are no keywords that suggest mocking, sneering, or irony.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the text has a defensive and slightly confrontational tone. phrases like ""putting words in my mouth again?"" and ""let's not let me have all the fun"" hint at a sarcastic undertone. the use of ""god"" in quotation marks and the casual mention of letting others respond for ""fun"" suggests a mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker is addressing someone and correcting their statement, implying that the other person misunderstood or misrepresented their words. the use of ""again"" suggests this is a repeated issue, adding to the frustration and sarcasm. the latter part of the text, ""let's not let me have all the fun,"" is likely meant ironically, indicating that dealing with the other person's arguments is not enjoyable but rather tiring or frustrating.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is defensive and mocking. the true intention seems to be highlighting the speaker's frustration while making a correction. both indicate a sarcastic tone due to the use of ironic language and the context of correction in a somewhat belittling manner.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

### response:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates frustration and a sense of wrong being done. keywords such as ""deliberate acts of fabrication,"" ""false and fraudulent claims,"" and ""refute such claims"" suggest a defensive and accusatory tone. the emotion conveyed here is primarily one of indignation or upset.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to accuse someone (either a specific individual or a group) of lying and misrepresenting their statements. the mention of ""deliberate acts"" and ""fraudulent claims"" underscores a serious accusation.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with expressing indignation and frustration. there is no exaggerated irony, mocking tone, or indirectness that would signify sarcasm. the language is straightforward and accusatory, not sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be an agreement towards the age of the earth being suitable for supporting mankind. however, the phrase ""i don't know if we can be as accurate as a couple of million years"" hints at a possible underlying doubt or disbelief, which can be an indication of sarcasm.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence might be employing sarcasm by exaggerating the precision of geological time scales and then ""agreeing"" that the earth's age is just right for supporting humans. this could be a subtle ridicule of the concept of the earth's age being fine-tuned for human life, which has been a topic of debate among certain groups.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
after comparing the surface sentiment which seemed agreeable but with hints of doubt, and the true intention which likely involves ridiculing the precision of the earth's age, i conclude that the statement is indeed sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment of dismissal and disagreement aligns with the sarcastic rhetorical device used.

        I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal. The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the LIFE of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk. When both lives are going to be lost, it is better to save one as opposed to losing two. The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be strongly opinionated and emotionally charged. keywords and phrases such as ""abortion is murder,"" ""should be illegal,"" ""holocaust on the unborn children,"" and ""ashamed of as a country"" suggest a very strong, emotionally negative stance against abortion. there are no indicators of humor, light-heartedness, or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.

#### step 2: true intention
the language style is direct and impassioned. the writer employs emotionally charged language to convey a serious and sincere viewpoint against abortion. the use of strong comparisons, like ""holocaust on the unborn children,"" indicates an earnest attempt to emphasize the gravity of the issue according to the writer’s perspective. there are no rhetorical devices such as hyperbole, irony, or contrast that typically indicate sarcasm.

#### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a serious, earnest, and emotionally charged expression of an anti-abortion viewpoint. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

"This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""untenable assumption"", ""premise is clearly not true"", ""contradiction in terms"", ""silly question""
- **tone:** the tone appears to be critical and slightly condescending, particularly with the use of phrases like ""untenable assumption"" and ""silly question"".

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses strong declarative statements to assert an argument. words like ""untenable"", ""clearly not true"", and ""contradiction in terms"" indicate a highly confident stance. the term ""silly question"" adds a dismissive tone, while the author reinforces their point by saying, ""i have demonstrated this before"".
- **language style:** the style is precise and argumentative. the use of logical reasoning implies the author's intention to firmly refute the posed question.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment:** the sentiment is critical and slightly dismissive.
- **true intention:** the true intention is to refute an argument authoritatively and dismiss the recurring question as baseless.

while the tone includes some dismissiveness (such as ""silly question""), it does not exhibit the exaggeration or irony typically associated with sarcasm. the primary aim appears to be a straightforward refutation rather than mockery.

        ### Input:
        I don't have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins. I don't think many, if any, Christians really do - satire about atheism isn't a strong Christian practice, not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity, it seems. Maybe that's what made Poe's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords and phrases include ""i don't have the time nor the funding,"" ""i don't think many, if any, christians really do,"" ""satire about atheism isn't a strong christian practice,"" and ""not nearly as strong as atheist satire about christianity.""
- these words and phrases suggest a comparison between the abilities of christians and atheists regarding satire.
- the sentence concludes with a reference to ""poe's law,"" which is often discussed in contexts that highlight the difficulty in distinguishing between sincere expressions and satire on the internet.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence appears to be making a commentary on the disparity between christians and atheists when it comes to creating satire, implying that atheists are more adept at it.
- the mention of the lack of time and funding serves to emphasize the difficulty or unwillingness among christians to produce such content.
- the discussion seems to acknowledge ""poe's law,"" which further implies that the writer understands the nuance and layers of satire, indicating a potential ironic undertone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment seems to be a straightforward comparison, but the context and use of phrases like ""poe's law"" suggest a deeper level of understanding that could be laced with irony.
- the true intention appears to be subtly highlighting the irony of the situation—christians discussing atheism satire and finding themselves less capable at it compared to atheists.
- this subtle irony combined with the context of ""poe's law"" suggests a layer of sarcasm.

example label: not sarcastic

Steps:  
step 1: surface sentiment - the statement appears analytical and critical, containing phrases such as ""we don't have free will"" and ""we are forced."" there is no exaggerated or mocking tone, nor are there sentimental phrases or emojis typically associated with sarcasm.

step 2: true intention - the sentence straightforwardly argues against the notion of free will under divine constraint. the language is literal and lacks the rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm.

### step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement appears informative and descriptive. 
- it includes phrases like ""gave me an opportunity to observe intimately,"" ""development of infants,"" and ""a delightful species the three-year-olds are.""
- there is a mix of neutral descriptive language and some seemingly positive description of children’s developmental stages.

### step 2: true intention
- the statement aims to provide an observation of the behavior and development of young children.
- ""what a delightful species the three-year-olds are"" could be interpreted sarcastically, given the common challenges parents and caregivers face with children at that age.
- the repetition of ""no! no! no!"" and ""no! i wont! and you cant make me!"" might be highlighting the defiance typically seen in two-year-olds, possibly in a humorous or mocking way which could indicate sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment seems positive about the children’s development but the phrases ""a delightful species"" and the repetition indicating defiance could be interpreted sarcastically.
- given the common frustration associated with these behaviors, there is a high possibility that the statement, although presented in an informative manner, is laced with sarcasm.

i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a sincere expression of agreement and understanding. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of the input contains clues indicating humor and skepticism. the phrase ""bwaaaaaaahahahahahahahah"" strongly suggests that the speaker finds something extremely funny or ridiculous. the laughter is amplified with many letters, which is often used to express mockery or disbelief. 

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the sentence becomes clearer when considering rhetorical devices and language style. the laughter before the statement adds a layer of hyperbole, making the following statement appear unrealistic to the speaker. the rhetorical question ""so you are saying that my dna reflects the fact that i live in texas?"" suggests the speaker finds this notion absurd. the exaggeration and questioning imply that the speaker does not genuinely believe the statement they are referring to and is mocking it.

### step 3: compare and analyze
both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in indicating a sarcastic tone. the extended laughter followed by a rhetorical question reveals a clear mockery or disbelief in the statement about dna reflecting the fact that someone lives in texas.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""nazis,"" ""specialized in death,"" ""pro-life people.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""need to do a little study"" can imply a condescending tone. the comparison between ""nazis"" and ""pro-life people"" may indicate strong emotions.
- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** the text shows a sarcastic tone, indicating a harsh criticism and comparison.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **language style:** informal and accusatory.
- **rhetorical devices:** the comparison between nazis' actions and pro-life people's stance, accompanied by condescension (""little boy, you need to do a little study""), suggests the use of sarcasm to criticize or belittle the addressed person or their viewpoint.
- **true intention:** to mockingly critique the knowledge or opinion of the person being addressed, comparing them unfavorably to nazis in a highly sarcastic manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** both the surface wording and deeper intention of the text align in showing a sarcastic and critical tone.
- **inference:** the text is dripping with sarcasm, using a condescending and mocking tone to criticize the person's understanding or viewpoint.

Steps:
### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

- clues: “gays whine for the right,” “exclusion of the right of children,” “raised in an overwhelming and natural world of heterosexuality.”
- sentimental phrases suggest a negative tone towards gays advocating for adoption rights.
- the language used is dismissive (“whine”), indicating frustration or denial of the legitimacy of the argument presented by gays wanting to adopt.

### step 2: true intention
- the writer argues against the adoption rights of gays, prioritizing the notion that children should be raised by heterosexual parents. 
- the phrase “gays whine” is particularly loaded, suggesting the writer believes the claim for adoption rights is trivial or unworthy.
- emphasis is placed on the “natural world of heterosexuality,” portraying same-sex parenting as unnatural or inferior.
- there doesn’t seem to be an intention to use irony to imply the opposite; the sentiment straightforwardly opposes the viewpoint it discusses.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) indicates a negative, dismissive attitude.
- true intention (step 2) aligns with the surface sentiment, where the writer strongly opposes adoption rights for gays without suggesting an opposite or hidden meaning.
- based on the analysis, there is no evidence of sarcasm, as the message is clear and consistent in its negativity.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Input:
        And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.

        ","### step 1:
the surface sentiment appears to be negative. keywords and phrases such as ""meaningless babble,"" ""whether you like it or not,"" ""whining,"" and the authoritative tone indicate a dismissive and condescending attitude.

### step 2:
the true intention of the sentence is to criticize and dismiss any opposition to the concept of evolution. the language style is direct, confrontational, and uses rhetorical devices such as dismissive phrases (""meaningless babble"") and imperative statements (""whining about it won't change it""). the speaker's intent is to undermine the opposing viewpoint and assert the validity of evolutionary theory.

### step 3:
both the surface sentiment and the true intention suggest a confrontational and dismissive stance rather than irony or mockery. while aggression and dismissiveness are present, there is no indication of sarcasm.

Steps:  
step 1: surface sentiment - the statement appears analytical and critical, containing phrases such as ""we don't have free will"" and ""we are forced."" there is no exaggerated or mocking tone, nor are there sentimental phrases or emojis typically associated with sarcasm.

step 2: true intention - the sentence straightforwardly argues against the notion of free will under divine constraint. the language is literal and lacks the rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment matches the true intention, as both convey a serious argument without any underlying sarcasm.

Steps:
### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues:
  - ""seek to support their belief system,"" ""more likely to accept what science tells them...without giving the details much thought.""
  - ""people are often short on patience you know.""
  - ""an educated person disregards them because of impatience, or arrogance.""
  - ""it's the difference in having been taught what to think, vs. knowing how to think.""
  - ""there is a reason why the most successful countries involve people besides only the educated in the political process.""

- sentimental phrases:
  - the surface sentiment includes words like ""impatience,"" ""arrogance,"" and ""disregards,"" which have negative connotations.
  - phrases like ""post # 40 indicates it"" and ""they're not scientific, they're common sense"" may imply dismissive or skeptical tones.
  - overall, the tone suggests some judgment and critique.

### step 2: true intention
- the author appears to be criticizing individuals who might blindly follow scientific or atheistic beliefs without critically evaluating details. 
- there is a comparison between being educated and truly understanding (knowing how to think). this can be seen as a subtle critique of a certain attitude among educated individuals.
- there are no overtly hyperbolic statements or exaggerated praise to suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic. 

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment is critical and somewhat negative.
- the true intention also appears to be a genuine critique rather than disguised praise or exaggerated commentary.
- the consistency between the negative surface sentiment and the genuine intention suggests that the text is not sarcastic.

- the phrases are critical and assertive but lack positive or negative sentimental phrases or emojis indicating strong emotion.
- the term ""strawman"" can indicate a dismissive attitude toward the opposing view but does not inherently suggest sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language is direct and argumentative, aimed at making a clear distinction between science and religion in an educational context.
  - the phrase ""warmed over creationism"" suggests a critical and somewhat dismissive tone but not necessarily sarcasm.
  - the structure is straightforward and logical, focusing on differentiating between what should be taught in science classes and what should not.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment is critical and assertive, condemning the promotion of intelligent design (id) in science classes.
  - the true intention is to emphasize that only scientifically validated ideas should be taught in science courses.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1:
the surface sentiment indicates a potentially mixed tone. although the statement initially appears to support and commend the act of getting one's tubes tied as an act of responsibility, the use of phrases like ""too bad more women (and men) don't share your level of responsibility"" and ""we wouldn't need to debate the 'need' for abortions"" hints at a critical and possibly sarcastic undertone. 

### step 2:
analyzing the language and tone more deeply, the true intention seems to involve criticism and judgment. the hypothetical scenario where more people act similarly to avoid the need for abortions suggests a moralistic and possibly sarcastic stance. the mention of responsibility and the implied judgment towards others who apparently lack it create a sense of irony and sarcasm. the use of ""emotico"" (likely a typo for ""emoticon"" or meant to signify a facial expression) doesn't carry positive or neutral sentiment, adding to the critical tone.

### step 3:
comparing the surface and true intentions, it becomes apparent that the statement is layered with irony and a hint of judgment towards general societal behaviors. the lack of a straightforward, factual, or supportive tone despite the initial positive sentiment indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.

   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention align closely, presenting a straightforward, factual argument.

### step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""actually"" can imply a rhetorical question or disbelief, hinting at sarcasm.
   - **language style:** the style is questioning and somewhat accusatory, indicating disbelief or ridicule towards lappster's understanding.
   - **true intention:** to mock or question lappster's understanding of the relationship between evolution and morality, implying that lappster might not truly understand the concept of evolution.

### step 3: **comparison and analysis**

- the initial sentiment appears to be a direct summary of someone's stance, followed by an expression of agreement and a point of divergence.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the use of ""so, in summary"" suggests the speaker is summarizing someone's opinion, potentially with a hint of skepticism.
  - the rhetorical question ""you just want it used judiciously?"" might imply a subtle critique or questioning of the thoroughness of the other person's stance.
  - the phrase ""same here"" is a point of agreement but could be seen as setting up for a contrast.
  - ""where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously"" suggests a polite disagreement and sets the stage for a potential critique or discussion of finer points.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the keywords and phrases include ""hmm,"" ""while she is right at the first point,"" and ""the second doesn't follow.""
- the word ""hmm"" can imply contemplation or skepticism.
- the phrase ""while she is right at the first point"" acknowledges a correct statement.
- the phrase ""the second doesn't follow"" implies a logical inconsistency or disagreement with the second point.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence seems to be expressing a mixed evaluation where the speaker agrees with one part but disagrees with another.
- the use of ""hmm"" could suggest a tone of doubt or a subtle hint of irritation.
- there is a contrast between acknowledging correctness and pointing out a flaw.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment shows a mixed response with mild skepticism.
- true intention indicates a balanced judgment but with an underlying tone of doubt or slight criticism.
- the overall tone could be interpreted as a subtle form of sarcasm, given the ""hmm"" at the start which might imply some level of disbelief or irony in the assessment.

""so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body. what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. the genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc. the body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the dna sequence.""

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** no evident use of sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices that would hint at a different meaning from the literal one.
   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention align closely, presenting a straightforward, factual argument.
   - **final inference:** given the alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention, the final sarcasm label for this text is firmly **not sarcastic**.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **tone:** the tone appears critical and questioning. the choice of words, such as ""lack of support"", ""isn't accepted"", and ""never present any"", implies skepticism and disbelief.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses questioning and somewhat confrontational phrasing to critique the beliefs or claims related to mythology and creationism. the repeated questioning and critical language like ""assertion that you believe because it tells you what you want to hear"" and ""creationists keep claiming to have 'proof' and never present any"" suggests a dismissive attitude towards these claims.
- **language style:** the style is direct and pointed, featuring detailed criticisms, which indicates an attempt to undermine or debunk the claims made by creationists.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is highly critical and skeptical, evident from phrases that question the validity and documentation of creationist claims.
- the true intention, derived from the language style and questioning, aligns with this critical sentiment. the text is dismissive and attempts to expose what the author sees as the weaknesses in creationist arguments.

from these observations, there is a clear indication that the text is critical and dismissive. the consistent tone of skepticism, without employing irony or humor typically seen in sarcasm, suggests that the text is earnest in its critique.

""but...but...   i just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. now i'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   as to driving...don't care.   what i'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. there's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. you saying they can't do that?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""so what else is new?"", ""does texas support the death penalty?""
- **tone:** the phrase ""so what else is new?"" indicates a sense of resignation or familiarity, suggesting that the information or situation being mentioned is not surprising or is expected.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the question ""does texas support the death penalty?"" is likely rhetorical. given the widespread knowledge that texas is known for its active use of the death penalty, the preceding phrase ""so what else is new?"" implies that the speaker is commenting on something that is already well-known or obvious.
- **language style:** the use of a rhetorical question combined with a phrase that implies familiarity suggests a sarcastic undertone. the speaker appears to be highlighting the predictability or lack of newsworthiness of texas supporting the death penalty.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of resignation or familiarity aligns with the true intention of making a sarcastic comment about the predictability or common knowledge of texas's stance on the death penalty. the rhetorical question and the phrase ""so what else is new?"" reinforce the sarcastic nature.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a sincere expression of agreement and understanding. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

**step 1**: the surface sentiment appears to be slightly challenging or condescending. the phrase ""i'll bet"" often conveys doubt or disbelief in a subtle, potentially mocking manner.

**step 2**: the true intention of the sentence uses a rhetorical device, namely sarcasm. the speaker implies that they believe the other person lacks knowledge, with an implied tone of superiority or skepticism.

**step 3**: analyzing both steps, the sentence seems to use irony, suggesting the opposite of what is stated in a mocking sense. hence, we classify it as displaying sarcasm.",1

- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to contain skepticism or criticism, marked by phrases like ""formalized set of rules and procedures"" and the use of multiple question marks, which often implies disbelief or ridicule. the term ""with a higher refresh rate"" also seems to be mocking the comparison.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention is likely to criticize or ridicule the comparison being made. the speaker appears to be mocking the idea of comparing a rigorous logical process to something with a ""higher refresh rate,"" which doesn't make logical sense in this context.

### step 3: compare and analyze surface sentiment and true intention
both the surface sentiment and the true intention point towards a mocking or ridiculing stance. the rhetorical devices, such as the exaggerated question marks and the incongruent analogy, suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""i don't expect you to be able to understand that"" is key here. it implies that the speaker thinks the listener is not capable of understanding something, which often carries an intention to belittle or mock.
- **language style:** the formal and somewhat pedantic use of ""actually"" and ""provided proof"" contrasts sharply with the dismissive closing phrase, reinforcing a condescending attitude.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment indicates a belittling and condescending tone.
- the true intention, revealed through the dismissive and superior language, aligns with sarcasm, as the speaker is likely using this tone to mock or belittle the listener rather than to provide genuine proof or exceed expectations.

  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical assessment or an attempt to correct a perceived oversight.
  - the true intention matches this assessment without any underlying irony or sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the statement contrasts science and religion in a way that elevates the former while criticizing the latter.
  - the emphasis on ""test it. repeatedly."" and ""accept it without question"" suggests an indirect criticism of religion by affirming the merit of science.

- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral and factual. the statement mentions the ""constitutional rkba"" (right to keep and bear arms) and compares it to ""apples to oranges.""

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""apples to oranges"" is a common idiom used to indicate that two things are being compared that are fundamentally different. this could imply a dismissive or critical stance towards the comparison being made. however, it does not inherently indicate sarcasm without further context.
- the use of ""enumerated constitutional rkba"" shows that the speaker is putting emphasis on the legal and constitutional foundation of the right to keep and bear arms, which could imply a serious or defensive attitude.

By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.

### Example:
Input:
false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

the human collective is the authority. one major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.

### step 1:
what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment shows a critical and potentially mocking tone towards theistic authority. phrases like ""human collective is the authority"" and ""actually exists"" imply a comparison that diminishes the validity of theistic belief. the use of the phrase ""actually exists"" is a strong clue towards a sarcastic tone.

### step 2:
deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention of the sentence is to criticize or discredit theistic authority by contrasting it with human authority, highlighting the perceived non-existence of a theistic authority. the phrase ""actually exists"" serves as a rhetorical device to underscore the belief that theistic authority is imaginary, thereby mocking it.

### step 3:
compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
both the surface sentiment and the true intention point towards a mocking and critical stance, employing irony and contrast. these elements are indicative of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative. keywords and phrases such as ""oh joy,"" ""another drive by,"" and ""absolutely no proof or evidence"" suggest frustration or annoyance. the phrase ""oh joy"" is typically used sarcastically to express the opposite of happiness or excitement.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the sentence is to express frustration and skepticism about the situation being described. the use of the phrase ""oh joy"" at the beginning is a classic indicator of sarcasm, setting a negative tone. the subsequent phrases clarify that the speaker finds the situation lacking in substance and proof, reinforcing their frustration.

### step 3: compare and analyze
both the surface sentiment and the true intention point towards sarcasm. the initial sarcastic ""oh joy"" sets the tone, and the continuation of the sentence with negative connotations about ""another drive by"" and ""absolutely no proof or evidence"" confirms that the speaker is being sarcastic.

        ### Input:
        Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a ""link,"" whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the text discusses the characteristics and classification of archaeopteryx in relation to creationist views. the phrase ""yes, you do have a problem with archaeopteryx"" and the concluding ""imagine that!"" hint at a more condescending tone. keywords like ""problem"" and the exclamatory ""imagine that!"" are suggestive.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker seems to be pointing out inconsistencies in the creationist viewpoint by using specific characteristics of archaeopteryx as evidence. the exclamation ""imagine that!"" at the end implies that the speaker feels their point is self-evident and may be mocking the creationist's difficulties.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment includes signs of condescension and a critical attitude, especially with the use of keywords and tone that suggest disbelief or ridicule.
- the true intention also aligns with this, as the speaker is criticizing the creationist view and using facts about archaeopteryx to bolster their argument, ending with a rhetorical flourish indicative of sarcasm.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        You keep claiming that, but you never reference it. I'd like to see sources and names. Just because evolutionary sources don't claim to be engaging in a PR exercise doesn't mean they aren't doing it. There is plenty of evidence of it, even if they don't honestly admit it.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text has a confrontational and skeptical tone. keywords like ""you keep claiming,"" ""i'd like to see sources,"" and ""doesn't mean they aren't doing it,"" suggest a challenging attitude. additionally, phrases like ""plenty of evidence"" and ""even if they don't honestly admit it"" imply doubt and skepticism.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention behind the statement seems to be questioning the credibility and honesty of evolutionary sources. the language indicates frustration and disbelief, suggesting the speaker doesn't really trust the claims being made. 

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of skepticism and confrontation aligns with the true intention of challenging and doubting the credibility of the sources. the element of saying ""even if they don't honestly admit it"" suggests an underlying disbelief and a subtle form of irony, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be mixed. the phrase ""ouch jyoshu...you are hitting them outta the park today"" could be seen as a compliment, but ""ouch"" suggests some element of pain or discomfort, indicating potential sarcasm.
- the phrase ""it sounds nice but it certainly isn't the only moral rule and it certainly doesn't mean one follows it"" is more neutral to critical. the repeated use of ""certainly"" can hint at emphasis, which sometimes can indicate sarcasm.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the first part ""ouch jyoshu..."" suggests that jyoshu said something impactful, and the speaker acknowledges it, possibly with a hint of sarcasm due to the word ""ouch"".
- the true intention behind ""exactly, it sounds nice but it certainly isn't the only moral rule and it certainly doesn't mean one follows it. i'd say selfishness is probably the underlying value in many cases"" is to critically address the idea being discussed, indicating skepticism about people adhering to moral rules simply because they sound good.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment shows a mix of potentially sarcastic phrasing (""ouch jyoshu..."") and criticism. the true intention reveals a critical analysis of moral values, leaning towards sarcasm given the phrasing and overall skeptical tone.

### Example:
Input:
""so you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe it's true! get real baby even you don't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""

Steps:
### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.

- sentimental phrases like ""pathetic,"" ""dishonest,"" and ""downright idiotic"" indicate negative sentiment.
- the phrase ""good one comrade brian. :p"" along with the tongue-out emoji suggests a mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
- despite starting with ""i agree,"" the subsequent negative descriptors obviously oppose agreement.
- the exaggeration ""very hard time believing"" and ""actually post that with a straight face"" serve to mock the original post.
- the term ""comrade"" and the emoji further emphasize mockery, indicating that the speaker does not sincerely mean ""good one.""

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment is negative and sarcastic.
- true intention is also to mock the statement and the person (brian) who wrote about communism/socialism.
- clear contradiction in the initial agreement which is overshadowed by the sarcastic remarks.

  - ""you also fail to consider...""
- the use of these phrases suggests a critical yet straightforward inquiry.
- no positive or negative sentimental phrases or emojis indicating strong emotion or exaggerated expression.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical assessment or an attempt to correct a perceived oversight.

  - ""don't make such a big deal about...""
  - ""the other stuff was just peripheral""
- the tone appears to be somewhat dismissive or minimizing the importance of certain aspects.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - there's a contrast set up between the ""important"" part (life) and the ""peripheral"" part (other stuff), which suggests a downplaying of the latter.
  - the phrase ""don't make such a big deal about..."" can often carry a connotation of dismissiveness, which can be employed in both sarcastic and non-sarcastic tones depending on context.
  - there are no overtly exaggerated or ironic expressions present.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment seems to minimize or dismiss the relevance of some information in favor of focusing on the main topic.
  - there are no clear exaggerated cues or ironic tone that typically signify sarcasm.
  - the directness and the lack of hyperbolic language suggest it is more of a straightforward dismissive statement rather than a sarcastic remark.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative. keywords and phrases such as ""dumb,"" ""that's a bit of a sidestep,"" and ""if you want to make an argument, then make an argument"" suggest a critical tone.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the passage seems to be to strongly refute the claim that abortion is genocide, criticizing this comparison as illogical or invalid. the language style is direct and confrontational, with strong words like ""dumb"" indicating a dismissive attitude towards the opposing argument. there is also an element of frustration, which can be inferred from the bluntness and the imperative tone.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** no evident use of sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices that would hint at a different meaning from the literal one.
   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**

- **sentimental phrases:** ""utter fraking ****"", ""choose to ignore it"", ""scientifically ignorant christians"".
- **surface sentiment:** the text uses harsh and dismissive language, suggesting strong negative emotions towards the addressed group.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** use of strong language (""utter fraking ****""), and the phrase ""scientifically ignorant christians"" indicates a rhetorical attack. the overall tone is confrontational and accusatory.
- **language style:** aggressive, with an intention to criticize and dismiss opposing views. the use of derogatory terms and expletives indicates disdain or disrespect.
- **true intention:** to criticize and mock the addressed group (scientifically ignorant christians) for ignoring scientific evidence about the common ancestor.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment, which involves negative remarks and mockery, aligns with the deeper intention of criticizing and ridiculing a group for their perceived ignorance of scientific evidence. given the tone and language used, the text can be classified as sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body. what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. the genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc. the body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the dna sequence.""

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** no evident use of sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices that would hint at a different meaning from the literal one.
   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention align closely, presenting a straightforward, factual argument.
   - **final inference:** given the alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention, the final sarcasm label for this text is firmly **not sarcastic**.

- **sentimental phrases:** the terms ""rubbish"" and ""descending from monkeys and slimeball"" indicate a dismissive and mocking tone. the phrase ""bit more education"" implies condescension.
- **surface sentiment:** negative and disdainful.

### step 2: true intention deduction

**keywords and phrases:**
- ""actually, it's true.""
- ""one of darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection.""

the use of these phrases suggests an attempt to state a fact or clarify a point.

### step 2: true intention
**language style and rhetorical devices:**
- the phrase ""actually, it's true"" can sometimes be used sarcastically to emphasize that something is so obvious it shouldn't need clarification.
- the sentence is relatively straightforward but does have a slight potential hint of correcting a misconception in an almost patronizing manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
**surface vs. true intention:**
- the surface sentiment appears factual and clarifying.
- the true intention could be seen as slightly sarcastic, especially considering the use of ""actually,"" which in some contexts aims to correct someone who should already understand the point.

given the subtlety and potential patronizing tone, this suggests irony or mild sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""but what about the hypothetical?i can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural. so, what i was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture. that's why i brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. i think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the 'logical' brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. but faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and 'make sense' to more than one person, these specific 'explanations' can be passed down. so i don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text is neutral and analytical. it discusses ideas and asks a thought-provoking question without emotional or exaggerated language. there are no keywords that suggest mocking, sneering, or irony.

**step 2: true intention**
- the language used is straightforward and focused on explaining a concept regarding faith and the nature vs. nurture debate. the speaker does not use any rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradiction.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align as neutral and sincere. there is no deviation suggesting a hidden or contradictory meaning which is typical in sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to slightly confrontational. the phrases ""apples and oranges"" and ""we're not demanding that they have abortions either"" indicate a comparison and possibly a rebuttal, but there are no overtly emotional or sentimental phrases.

### step 2: true intention
- the statement seems to imply that the comparison being made (likely between two different things or arguments) is invalid or misplaced, which is a form of logical criticism. by stating ""we're not demanding that they have abortions either,"" it hints at an exaggerated or extreme example to demonstrate the invalidity of an opposing argument.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral to confrontational, and the true intention reveals the use of exaggerated comparison to highlight the illogical nature of the opposing argument. this is indicative of sarcasm, as it uses an extreme example to mock a particular point.

- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be critical and questioning rather than neutral. the multiple questions and phrases like ""isn't a good basis"" and ""has no realistic limit?"" suggest skepticism and a challenge to the opposing viewpoint.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention seems to be to undermine or challenge the argument that viability should not determine abortion laws. the rhetorical questions are crafted to provoke thought and highlight what the speaker sees as flaws or absurdities in the opposing view. the language style and structure (series of hypotheticals followed by rhetorical questioning) are often used in sarcastic or critical discourse.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
both the surface sentiment and the true intention suggest a critical and potentially mocking tone. the use of rhetorical questions and a challenging approach indicate sarcasm.

- these phrases suggest that the writer is disputing the other's claims and making extreme comparisons. the use of ""fear-mongering,"" ""hatred,"" ""logic-defying,"" and invoking a ""life-ending pandemic plague"" indicates strong negative sentiment and a significant degree of disbelief or disdain.
- hyperbolic language like ""perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague"" indicates an exaggerated expression.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language is highly critical and employs extreme exaggeration (i.e., hyperbole) to make a point.
  - there is a use of analogy (comparing to world war ii concentration camps) and hyperbole (unleashing a pandemic plague).
  - the intention seems to be mocking or criticizing the opponent’s viewpoint by using exaggerated comparisons and invoking emotional reactions.
  - the statement implies that the accusations made by the author towards the opponent are implausible and ridiculous.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment is critical and hostile, expressed through strong negative language and hyperbole.
  - the true intention matches the surface sentiment but includes an underlying layer of mocking and irony through exaggerated rhetoric, amplifying the critical stance in a sarcastic way.
  
**inference:**

- both the surface sentiment and the true intention suggest a dismissive and critical approach, often found in sarcastic remarks. the rhetorical question and exclamatory phrase indicate a disingenuous query, characteristic of sarcasm.

Steps:  
step 1: surface sentiment - the statement appears analytical and critical, containing phrases such as ""we don't have free will"" and ""we are forced."" there is no exaggerated or mocking tone, nor are there sentimental phrases or emojis typically associated with sarcasm.

step 2: true intention - the sentence straightforwardly argues against the notion of free will under divine constraint. the language is literal and lacks the rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment matches the true intention, as both convey a serious argument without any underlying sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment - the statement appears to question the importance of the label ""married"" in the context of same-sex couples receiving equal rights. the phrase ""what's the beef...except that you can't say that you're 'married'?"" introduces a dismissive tone that suggests there is no substantial issue, potentially hinting at a sarcastic undertone.

step 2: true intention - the sentence seems to imply that the only problem with not being able to use the word ""married"" is trivial, despite the deeper implications of equal rights. this suggests the speaker might be using sarcasm to criticize the emphasis on terminology rather than the substance of equal rights.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment's dismissive tone matches the true intention's critique of focusing on terminology rather than equality, which indicates the use of sarcasm.",1

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

the surface sentiment expresses frustration and sadness. keywords and phrases such as ""couldn't they pick on somebody else?"", ""bully tactic"", and ""that's sad"" indicate a feeling of being unfairly targeted and an earnest plea for fairness.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to highlight the perceived unfairness and targeting of jewish homosexuals by christian heterosexuals who oppose same-sex marriage. the rhetorical question (""couldn't they pick on somebody else?"") and the comparison to bullying indicate an attempt to emphasize the disproportionate and relentless nature of the criticism faced by the speaker's community.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment of frustration and sadness aligns with the true intention of emphasizing unfair treatment. the language used is straightforward and earnest, aimed more at eliciting empathy rather than mocking or ironic.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

  - ""makes me neither a liberal or conservative""
  - ""inspired by vor who kept signing his posts with quotes from karl marx""
- the first part of the sentence seems straightforward and factual.
- the mention of being inspired by someone using karl marx's quotes adds a potential layer of irony considering marx's political ideology and the conservative image typically associated with strict constitutionalism.

### step 2: true intention

  - the structure doesn't overtly indicate humor or exaggeration but might imply underlying sarcasm by juxtaposing strict constitutionalism with marxist inspiration.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

   - **true intention:** the true intention seems to be highlighting a perceived inconsistency or to mock the idea that gay couples should only marry if they have kids.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears supportive but the true intention suggests an underlying sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment is somewhat confrontational and dismissive. the phrase ""nice try"" often carries a sarcastic undertone when used in this context. the rest of the sentence argues a hypothetical scenario to expose a perceived inconsistency, suggesting a critical stance. keywords and phrases such as ""nice try,"" ""to this day,"" and ""no matter what excuse"" indicate a dismissive and somewhat incredulous tone.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker's true intention is to challenge and refute an argument, possibly about shifting alliances or historical perceptions. the hypothetical scenario about america being an ally to germany during wwii is used to highlight what the speaker believes is an unreasonable stance. the rhetorical device here is the exaggerated hypothetical scenario to showcase the inconsistency.

### step 3: compare and analysis
the surface sentiment shows signs of sarcasm through its dismissive and confrontational language. the true intention also uses a hypothetical and exaggerated scenario to emphasize a point, which reinforces the sarcastic tone. both the surface sentiment and true intention align with the characteristics of sarcasm, like exaggeration and critical undertones.

given the input text, it is clear that the author employs sarcasm by suggesting that introducing contradictory facts is a way to ""muddy the waters,"" which is a phrase that normally suggests confusion but is used here ironically. the structure and tone of the sentence, including the signature ""signed x gazer,"" further emphasize the sarcastic nature. therefore, the correct label is **sarcastic**.",1

- the sentiment can be perceived as doubtful or critical. the phrase ""not sure how you can tell that"" suggests skepticism or a questioning attitude.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention appears to challenge the validity of someone's ability to make an inference due to the lack of information ""since very little is mentioned about his methods."" this doubting context can be a hint towards questioning someone's statement in a way that may imply it's not reasonable or logical to make such a statement with limited information.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows skepticism, and the true intention reinforces this by questioning the basis of someone's claim. both suggest a subtle criticism, which is a common feature of sarcasm, as it implies that it's unreasonable to make a conclusion with insufficient information.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence seems to be to call out someone for avoiding or not addressing a topic. the rhetorical question ""care to explain your views"" can be read as sarcastic, implying that the person has avoided doing so already. the phrase ""for the folks here"" might be used to put additional social pressure on the person, which can also convey a sarcastic edge.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention suggest frustration and a mocking tone towards the individual addressed. the context and language used indicate that the speaker doesn't expect a genuine explanation and is instead highlighting the avoidance in a sarcastic manner.

- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention of the sentence is to criticize atheism by drawing a provocative and extreme comparison to hitler and stalin. the language is designed to evoke a strong emotional reaction and it uses a strawman argument to depict atheism in an extremely negative light. the use of the word ""disgusting"" underscores the speaker's contempt.

### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""not going to consider"", ""pillar of society"", ""not condone his murder"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** negative view of dr. tiller, but morally opposing murder.
   - **surface sentiment:** conflicted, morally unequivocal.

### step 2: true intention deduction
   - **rhetorical devices:** potential use of irony or understatement, particularly in the phrase ""not going to consider dr. tiller a pillar of society"".
   - **language style:** formal, indicating a nuanced stance. the combination of acknowledging a negative viewpoint but refusing to condone murder suggests a critique of extreme actions despite personal disagreements.
   - **true intention:** to condemn murder categorically, despite holding a negative opinion of the individual.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
   - **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment shows a morally unambiguous condemnation of murder, while the true intention reveals a nuanced stance that potentially critiques extreme reactions.
   - **final inference:** the formal tone and serious condemnation suggest that the primary intention is to make a moral statement against murder, not to mock or ridicule.

### Example:
Input:
false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

the surface sentiment indicates a confrontational and questioning tone. the use of ""got evidence to back that up??"" suggests a challenge to the previous statement or assumption, and the phrase ""i'm not sure how a stoner's worse than an alcoholic really"" implies skepticism. the use of the double question marks and the name signing ""-wez"" adds a somewhat informal and skeptical tone.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

the speaker's true intention seems to be to challenge and question the validity of the prior statement or implication made by someone else. the rhetorical style here is that of skepticism and possibly disbelief. the comparison between a stoner and an alcoholic is meant to challenge the notion that one is worse than the other, possibly implying that neither is particularly better or worse. the overall language style suggests an intent to provoke thought or reconsideration rather than to provide information straightforwardly.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

the surface sentiment and the true intention seem to align with a kind of skeptical or confrontational tone that can be interpreted as sarcastic. the challenge to provide evidence and the questioning of a comparison between a stoner and an alcoholic are presented in a way that suggests the speaker may not genuinely be seeking an answer, but rather criticizing the unsupported statement.

- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** the phrases used are conversational with a mix of neutral statements and a slight hint of skepticism or doubt.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **language style:** casual, informal, conversational.
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""i think some people will and have argued"" suggests mild doubt or an attempt to distance oneself from the argument being presented. the mention of ""finding a quote"" implies that the speaker is using a generic or possibly exaggerated claim without immediate support. the language ""you do have a point"" is a concession that subtly detracts from the strength of the previous argument.
- **true intention:** to question the validity or realism of the argument about the scotus ruling and its impact on home invasions, possibly in a sarcastic manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears neutral to cautious, while the true intention seems to hint at subtle skepticism or sarcasm regarding the claim. the conversational tone and choice of phrasing indicate that the speaker may not fully endorse the viewpoint they are reporting and is possibly mocking it indirectly.
- **inference:** the subtle language choices and the tone suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic, as the comments seem to imply disbelief or mockery of the idea that criminals would worry about homeowners with guns due to a court ruling.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.

- **tone:** the surface tone appears critical and accusatory, pointing out an apparent contradiction in behavior.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text employs irony and sarcasm by referring to al gore as the ""high priest of global warming,"" implying a religious fervor for the cause while highlighting contradictory behavior in energy consumption.
- **language style:** the language uses statistics to juxtapose gore's energy consumption against his advocacy for reducing energy use, implying hypocrisy.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- sentimental phrases: ""actually"" (can suggest condescension), ""flat out lie"" (strong negative assertion), ""suggest you actually read it"" (implies lack of prior reading).
- tone: argumentative and somewhat condescending.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker believes that stable, safe, and loving homes are important to society and that gays and lesbians are capable of providing such homes.
- the phrase “actually” at the beginning often indicates a correction or contradiction to common beliefs, adding a layer of condescension.
- phrases like “deny” and “flat out lie” strongly assert that the opposing view is wrong.
- suggesting to “actually read” a report comes off as a bit condescending, indicating that the speaker believes the listener has not done adequate research.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment and true intention both show a strong and confrontational stance.
- there is some condescension in the tone indicating the speaker believes they are correcting an obvious misconception.
- given the context, there is an underlying layer of sarcasm, particularly in phrases like ""actually,"" ""deny,"" and ""suggest you actually read it"" which implies the subject hasn't done so already.

- the rhetorical question ""but how do god's origins and nature make sense?"" highlights the perceived inadequacy of the god hypothesis.
- the concluding remark, ""the god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not,"" underlines the speaker's intention to reject the argument as insufficient.

the surface sentiment suggests a disapproving or critical tone. keywords and phrases like ""only understands"" and ""goes against what is accepted by scientists"" imply that the sentence might be questioning someone's understanding or intentions.

### step 2:
deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence seems to imply that the person only understands or accepts the concept of natural selection when it contradicts scientific consensus. the use of the word ""only"" and the structure of the sentence suggest a critique of the person's selective acceptance of scientific principles.

### step 3:
compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and true intention both suggest a disapproving tone, possibly mocking the person's inconsistent understanding or acceptance of natural selection based on personal biases. this hints at a sarcastic tone where the speaker is being ironically critical.

### Example:
Input:
false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

1. **surface sentiment**:
   - the text appears to be correcting someone and includes phrases like ""there is only one problem with your statement my friend,"" and ""i'll fix it!"" which seem somewhat helpful but may also hint at a condescending tone.
  
2. **true intention**:
   - the use of ""my friend"" can often be a sarcastic way to soften criticism. additionally, the statement ""there! it looks correct now!"" after providing a correction suggests a tone of mockery or sarcasm about the initial error.

3. **comparison and analysis**:
   - in the surface sentiment, while it appears helpful, the choice of words and exclamation points like ""i'll fix it!"" and ""there! it looks correct now!"" indicate a likely sarcastic tone. there is a disconnect between the outwardly helpful tone and the condescension implied by the corrective and finalizing phrases.

- **tone:** the tone appears critical, possibly condescending, implying that someone (or something) fails to understand their role or impact.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement uses subtle derogatory language by suggesting that the ""comic relief"" is unaware of the situation, which could imply incompetence or missing the point entirely.
- **language style:** the style suggests a critique masked under the guise of a simple observation, typically characteristic of sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis

- clues: ""oh, i don't know about that."", ""march of the penguins was a box office success and an oscar winner for best documentary."", ""calling any of moore's movies 'a documentary' requires one to employ some artistic license with the term and some slight of hand.""
- sentimental phrases indicate skepticism and belittlement.
- the language used in the latter part of the input shows mockery and dismissal.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker seems to be dismissing the idea that michael moore's movies are true documentaries.
- the reference to ""artistic license"" and ""slight of hand"" indicates that the speaker believes moore's work lacks factual accuracy and credibility as documentaries.
- the initial reference to ""march of the penguins"" serves as a contrast to illustrate what a successful, award-winning documentary is, implying that moore's films do not meet these standards.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is skeptical and dismissive.
- true intention (step 2) aligns with the surface sentiment by explicitly conveying disbelief in the credibility of moore's documentaries.
- the reference to moore's movies in a mocking manner and the use of phrases like ""requires one to employ some artistic license with the term"" suggest a sarcastic tone.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears to be positive and hopeful. however, the true intention, indicated by the possibly exaggerated reliance on hope and prayer, suggests sarcasm.

""so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body. what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. the genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc. the body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the dna sequence.""

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.

   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**

- the text seems to carry a critical tone. keywords like ""relevant evidence,"" ""higher level of credibility,"" and references to ""national enquirer or star"" suggest a dismissive stance toward the other person's standards.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""by your standards i should make a thread based on the national enquirer or star"" is likely to be sarcastic. referring to national enquirer, known for sensational and often dubious content, contrasts sharply with the demand for credible evidence. this contrast implies irony and criticism of the other person's credibility standards.

the text seems defensive and challenging. the speaker is asking for evidence in a way that suggests they believe such evidence does not exist. keywords like ""challenge"" and phrases like ""i do not hold that opinion"" indicate a defensive tone.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker's true intention appears to be to refute a claim or opinion attributed to them. by asking the other person to show evidence of their supposed opinion, the speaker implies skepticism and disbelief that such evidence exists. this can often be a form of irony or sarcasm, used to highlight the absence of foundation for the other person's claim.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: defensive and challenging
- true intention: refuting a claim by implying it is baseless, potentially using irony.

given the challenging nature and the context in which the speaker is demanding evidence of an opinion they purportedly do not hold, there is a strong suggestion of irony. the speaker likely believes that no such evidence exists and is using this statement to underline the baselessness of the claim.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- **keywords and phrases:** ""nonsense"", ""name the holes"", ""the parts that are conjecture"", ""never, ever"", ""isn't time"", ""only major points""
- **sentimental phrases:** ""nonsense"" is dismissive and somewhat confrontational.
- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** frustrated, dismissive, and defensive.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **language style:** the language is somewhat informal but still direct. it appears to respond to a critique or a claim made by someone else.
- **rhetorical devices:** 
  - **sarcasm:** the phrase ""never, ever"" is hyperbolic and emphasizes incredulity. the insistence on ""there isn't time"" and ""only major points"" can suggest frustration with repeated misunderstanding or an ill-informed statement.
  - **defensiveness:** the overall tone is defensive, suggesting the speaker feels the need to refute a claim fervently.
- **true intention:** the speaker aims to rebut a claim and highlight the inaccuracies of the opposing statement. the use of hyperbolic phrases and frustration hints at sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the sentiment is frustrated and defensive on the surface. the persistent tone and hyperbolic language suggest an underlying sarcasm.
- **inference:** given the context, the insistence, and hyperbolic phrases, the text indeed carries a sarcastic tone in rebutting an inaccurate claim.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the keywords and phrases include ""i gotta admit,"" ""i got a real chuckle out of this one,"" and the emoji "":p"".
- the phrase ""i gotta admit"" often prefaces a statement that is somewhat reluctant but truthful.
- ""i got a real chuckle out of this one"" suggests amusement or finding humor in something.
- the emoji "":p"" is often used to indicate light-heartedness or playfulness.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence ""i got a real chuckle out of this one"" might imply that the speaker found something genuinely funny.
- however, the use of ""i gotta admit"" and the playful emoji "":p"" may imply a sarcastic undertone, especially if the context suggests that the speaker didn't actually find it amusing.
- the true intention could be that the speaker is mocking the situation or expressing a forced sense of humor.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows keywords and phrases that might suggest amusement.
- the true intention, however, reveals potential sarcasm indicated by the reluctant admission and the playful yet dismissive emoji.
- the alignment between surface sentiment and true intention suggests that the statement may carry an underlying mocking tone rather than genuine amusement.

  - ""you must take them by purely blind faith.""
- the use of phrases like ""purely blind faith"" suggests a critical stance.
- the absence of positive emotional language or emojis but the inclusion of the word ""blind faith"" hints at a dismissive attitude.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language employs a critical tone towards scientific theories, suggesting doubt or disbelief.
  - phrases like ""none of these can be proved... all of these contradict..."" indicate a facade of logical argumentation, but the exaggerated nature of ""purely blind faith"" hints at a satirical or mocking tone.

        Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,

        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""really,"" ""hundreds of millions,"" ""pretty insignificant""
- **tone:** the initial word ""really,"" suggests disbelief or doubt, setting a potentially sarcastic tone. phrases like ""hundreds of millions"" and ""pretty insignificant"" can signal exaggeration or downplaying.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole in ""hundreds of millions"" and ""pretty insignificant"" to emphasize a point. the use of ""really,"" at the start indicates a skeptical or mocking tone.
- **language style:** the style suggests an attempt to downplay one argument (b) against another (c), possibly using sarcasm to criticize or mock a perspective on gun use.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment indicates skepticism and the use of hyperbole and initial disbelief hints toward sarcasm.
- the true intention seems to be mocking or questioning the significance of one argument by emphasizing another through exaggerated numbers and use of ""really.""

the surface sentiment exhibits mixed signals. there are phrases that could be seen as earnest, but there's also a clear indication of frustration or disdain, particularly in the latter part with ""i'm sorry but my doctor is male... it just gets tiring after a while...""

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the sentence is complicated by the use of rhetorical devices. the beginning part poses hypothetical ethical questions, whereas the latter part employs a somewhat defensive and exasperated tone regarding gender pronouns. this shift indicates a deep-seated irritation, suggesting an underlying sarcasm particularly aimed at the politically correct language about gender.

### step 3: compare and analyze
though the initial parts of the text could be perceived as a genuine philosophical discussion, the change in tone and the pointed remark about pronouns distinctly convey sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

- **tone:** the tone appears skeptical and concerned.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses rhetorical questions and hyperbole. the rhetorical questions imply disbelief about the safety of national parks. the hyperbolic statement about cartel members being ""literally behind the next bush"" suggests exaggeration to emphasize danger.
- **language style:** the language style shows clear signs of sarcasm through rhetorical questioning and exaggeration meant to critique the idea that national parks are safe and there's no need for personal protection.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears skeptical and concerned, but the true intention is to criticize the notion of complete safety in national parks using sarcasm and hyperbole.
- the exaggerated dangers and rhetorical questions indicate that the author does not genuinely believe in the safety of national parks without personal protection.

- the key phrases include ""fetus can feel no pain,"" ""whose pain should i be concerned about?"" and ""why would its pain be more worthy of protection than the mother's?""
- these phrases imply a rational discussion or argument about the relative importance of the pain felt by a fetus versus the pain felt by the mother.
- there are no sentimental phrases or emojis present. the tone appears to engage in a sort of debate.

**step 2: true intention**
- the questions posed suggest a challenge to the notion that a fetus's pain should be prioritized over a mother’s. 
- the use of rhetorical questions (""why would its pain be more worthy of protection"") indicates a critical stance towards the opposite view.
- the intention seems to provoke thought and highlight a perceived inconsistency in the prioritization of pain between a fetus and the mother, which can be read as sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment suggests a rational, though critical, discussion, while the true intention seems more pointed and challenges the opposite perspective.
- the use of rhetorical questions and critical tone indicate a higher likelihood of sarcasm since the speaker is questioning the logic of prioritizing the fetus’s pain in a manner that can imply disbelief or criticism.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

### step 3:
the language used is mostly straightforward, but there is a slight indication of frustration with ""which often they don't."" while this could be seen as a mild critique, it is not heavily laden with irony or mocking tone. hence, it does not rise to the level of sarcasm.

""if the only choices we can possibly make are the one god approves, then we don't have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that god does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that god approves of. this is not free will.""  
example label: not sarcastic

Steps:  
step 1: surface sentiment - the statement appears analytical and critical, containing phrases such as ""we don't have free will"" and ""we are forced."" there is no exaggerated or mocking tone, nor are there sentimental phrases or emojis typically associated with sarcasm.

step 2: true intention - the sentence straightforwardly argues against the notion of free will under divine constraint. the language is literal and lacks the rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment matches the true intention, as both convey a serious argument without any underlying sarcasm.

        ","### steps:

step 1: surface sentiment - the statement appears critical and implicitly sarcastic, containing phrases such as ""no matter how insane, no matter how stupid, no matter how incapable,"" which appear to exaggerate the position of the so-called ""gunners."" these phrases indicate a mocking tone, suggesting a critique rather than a straightforward comment.

step 2: true intention - the sentence actually argues against the idea that everyone should have access to guns by sarcastically suggesting that such an extreme position is unreasonable. the exaggerated wording and negative descriptors imply the speaker's disdain for the position of unfettered gun access.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment of mockery and exaggeration matches the true intention, which is to criticize the pro-gun position through sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""move out of the rough areas,"" ""battered spouse,"" ""stop whining,"" and ""drug dealers and mass murderers"" indicate a harsh, judgmental, and authoritative tone.
- **tone:** the tone appears dismissive, harsh, and unsympathetic, suggesting a lack of empathy or understanding.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text employs hyperbole and metaphor (comparing staying in rough areas to a battered spouse who can't leave), as well as directive language (""stop whining,"" ""move out""). these indicate a critical stance toward people living in rough areas and perhaps mock the complexity of their situations.
- **language style:** the style is confrontational and dismissive, suggesting that the speaker views the situation as easily resolvable by simple actions, which can be interpreted as sarcastic in its oversimplification of a serious issue.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears judgmental and unsympathetic.
- the true intention seems to criticize people in rough areas through a simplified and dismissive perspective.
- the exaggerated simplicity and the use of harsh language suggest that the text uses sarcasm to mock the perceived complaints of those living in difficult conditions.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

the surface sentiment is complex and appears to be critical. clues include questioning phrases like ""what do you mean by this?"", ""could we not have..."", and ""is it not a conflict..."". the use of these rhetorical questions suggests a questioning or challenging tone rather than straightforward disagreement or agreement.

### step 2:
the true intention seems to be to highlight perceived inconsistencies in reasoning or policy regarding the treatment of juveniles under the law. the rhetorical devices used, such as posing questions that point out possible contradictions, suggest a critical attitude. the speaker is employing irony to underscore the perceived inconsistency in laws related to juvenile responsibility in different contexts (death penalty vs. abortion).

### step 3:
the surface sentiment is critical and questioning, and the true intention is to highlight inconsistencies through rhetorical questions and irony. this alignment between critical questioning and highlighting contradictions indicates the use of sarcasm.

the text appears mostly neutral and informative. it discusses the process of amending the iowa constitution, provides some historical context, and mentions public opinion polls without using overtly emotional or exaggerated language.

### step 2: true intention
the language used adds subtle hints of skepticism, particularly in the phrases ""this seems a no brainer in a populace vote,"" ""as a rule i lend polls very little credence,"" and ""i doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap.""

- ""this seems a no brainer"" could be interpreted as ironic since the outcome of votes is generally uncertain.
- lending ""very little credence"" to polls but mentioning them nonetheless indicates a level of skepticism.
- ""i doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap"" suggests the speaker is skeptical about a significant shift in public opinion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears neutral and matter-of-fact, but the true intention reflects slight irony and skepticism. phrases like ""no brainer"" and the mention of polls with little credence hint at a subtle sarcastic tone.

Input:
false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

  - the true intention matches this assessment without any underlying irony or sarcasm.

  - the true intention seems to be clarifying a point rather than mocking or contradicting in an ironic way.
- **inference:**
  - the explanatory tone and lack of overtly sarcastic markers indicate that the text is not intended to be sarcastic. the slight condescension detected is not strong enough to change the overall interpretation.

   - **true intention:** the intention appears to be to challenge or undermine the original argument using extreme examples, potentially in a sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
   - **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears to be serious and questioning, while the true intention, when considering the rhetorical nature and the smiley emoji, leans towards being sarcastic.

the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment seems to express a choice between two undesirable options: staying safe and dealing with insurance or risking life to protect property. phrases like ""choice between staying safe"" and ""risking my life to kill a burglar"" indicate a consideration of personal safety versus property protection. the closing sentence ""better to lose my laptop than my life"" underlines a preference for safety.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention here appears to be a critique of the situation where one has to decide between life and property. the speaker uses rhetorical emphasis to highlight the absurdity of the situation. they prefer personal safety over property which is a reasonable stance, yet the way it is phrased could imply criticism of the situation's logic, adding a layer of sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention reflect an underlying critique of the dilemma. the way the options are presented with such stark contrast (risking life vs. losing a laptop) and the concluding phrase imply a sarcastic tone by criticizing the unreasonable nature of the choice.

### Example:
Input:
""but...but...   i just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. now i'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   as to driving...don't care.   what i'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. there's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. you saying they can't do that?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""biologically speaking,"" ""legally starve,"" ""right to her body,"" ""i think no, by law.""
- **tone:** the tone initially appears serious and somewhat argumentative, focusing on a biological and legal examination of abortion and maternal rights.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text employs rhetorical questions (""can she legally starve the newborn child... simply because she has the 'right to her body?'"") to provoke thought and garner a specific response. there is a logical argument structure that aims to confront and challenge the reader’s views on abortion rights.
- **language style:** the style is direct, contrasting the biological and legal perspectives on maternal rights and the care of a child.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is serious and argumentative, and the true intention is to challenge the reader’s stance on a controversial topic.
- the rhetorical questions used here suggest a genuine invitation for debate, rather than an ironic or sarcastic critique.
- given that there is no use of irony, exaggeration for humorous effect, or indication that the opposite meaning is intended, the text does not appear sarcastic.

the text in the input exhibits clear signs of sarcasm. here's the step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text uses phrases like ""depends on your definition of retarded,"" ""think of how dumb the average person is,"" and ""makes you cringe,"" which indicate a negative and mocking tone.
- the part where the speaker says, ""i should just throw my hands in the air and scream 'take the wheel jesus!'"" and ""some magical being will fly down from heaven"" also carries a mocking and sarcastic sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention is to criticize the low standards for obtaining a driver's license and to mock the idea that divine intervention would help in driving situations. the speaker uses exaggerated scenarios to underline their point and employs irony to convey skepticism about the competence of the average driver and the efficacy of divine intervention.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align as mockingly sarcastic. the language style, use of exaggeration, and ironic statements all serve to reinforce this sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment contains elements that may indicate frustration or dispute. phrases like ""but as i mentioned before"" and ""therefore he is not god anymore"" suggest a critical or challenging tone. however, the language is also structured logically, which could imply a serious argument without clear emotional indicators of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the sentence appears to be to argue against the concept of complete free will under the tenets of christian theology. the logical progression and use of theological implications (""then you are saying god has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not god anymore"") suggest that the speaker is presenting a serious, reasoned argument.

### step 3: compare and analyze
while there are elements of criticism or challenge in the surface sentiment, the lack of exaggeration, hyperbole, or ironic contrast typically associated with sarcasm suggests that the speaker's tone is more serious and earnest. the statement is more likely to be a genuine argument against the concept presented.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

- the surface sentiment indicates a critical and questioning stance toward the church's position on abortion. the speaker uses factual language but with a tone that hints at skepticism and criticism. keywords and phrases like ""can't trust,"" ""fair decisions,"" and ""expect an honest good decision"" suggest a critical attitude.

### step 2:

- **sentimental phrases:** ""very interesting"", repeated use of periods may imply a tone of anticipation or skepticism.
- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** the surface sentiment appears to be expectant but neutral, with a hint of skepticism due to the repetitive use of periods indicating hesitation or implied continuation.

- **rhetorical devices:** the use of repetitive periods can indicate a sarcastic tone, as it often implies a trailing, waiting for expected but doubtful action or outcome.
- **true intention:** the writer seems to be skeptical about the effectiveness or the likelihood of the congress's actions being successful or worthwhile.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** though the surface sentiment seems expectant and neutral, the deeper meaning conveyed through informal style and punctuation implies doubt or disbelief, leading to a sarcastic undertone.

### Example:
Input:
""so you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe it's true! get real baby even you don't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""

Steps:
### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:

the surface sentiment of the input text appears neutral. the text is making a factual statement without any sentimental phrases or emotional indicators.

### step 2:
the true intention of the sentence appears to be making a logical argument to clarify that having human dna does not inherently make an entity a human being. the use of a rhetorical question at the end (""does that make them human beings?"") adds a questioning, almost challenging tone to the argument. it hints at a potentially sarcastic undertone, as the statement can be interpreted as a critique of simplistic definitions of humanness.

### step 3:
when comparing the surface sentiment (neutral) with the true intention (which contains a hint of critique through rhetorical questioning), it becomes evident that the author might be using sarcasm to challenge the reader's understanding of what it means to be human.

- the phrases imply a tone of disapproval and criticism towards the teaching of darwinism.
- the mention of teaching kids about complex scientific concepts like black holes and unified field theory could suggest a comparison, hinting at an underlying sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to be criticizing the perceived overemphasis on darwinism in education, implying that other complex scientific concepts are not similarly prioritized.
- the use of examples like black holes and unified field theory, where the knowledge is acknowledged as insufficient, contrasts with the implied certainty given to darwinism.
- there seems to be a rhetorical device at play: comparing the unteachable complexities of certain scientific theories to the supposedly political nature of darwinism. this comparison suggests irony or sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment displays a critical tone, and the true intention reveals a deeper criticism masked in a seemingly factual comparison.
- the rhetorical device of contrasting darwinism with other scientific theories in terms of teaching indicates a possible sarcastic undertone.
- this alignment points to the message having a significant layer of sarcasm aimed at the political aspects of darwinism.

        But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""sympathetic to gun control"", ""change society"", ""persecute the 2nd amendment"", ""taught morals"", ""sued"", ""reap what we sow"".
- **sentimental phrases:** the tone is accusatory and frustrated. phrases like ""persecute the 2nd amendment"", ""fear that they might offend"" and ""reap what we sow"" indicate a strong negative sentiment towards current societal changes.
- **surface sentiment:** negative and frustrated.

### step 2: true intention deduction

- **rhetorical devices:** there is evident use of sarcasm, particularly in the phrase ""can we get anyone to listen and change society, ooooor will you just use this problem"". this suggests skepticism that the issue will be addressed seriously. the phrase ""we reap what we sow"" implies a critical stance on the outcomes of current policies.
- **language style:** the style is critical and questioning, which is aiming to challenge and provoke thought regarding societal changes and gun control.
- **true intention:** to criticize and express frustration about the current approach to gun control and societal values.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment of frustration aligns with the true intention of criticizing current policies and approaches. the use of sarcastic remarks suggests that the text is meant to convey this criticism indirectly.
- **final inference:** given the alignment between the surface sentiment and the sarcastic rhetorical devices used, the final sarcasm label for this text is **sarcastic**.

step 1: surface sentiment - the statement includes phrases like ""i guess now it is??? makes no sense,"" which indicate confusion and a possible hint of skepticism. the multiple question marks and phrases like ""makes no sense"" and ""those are obviously not my beliefs"" often signal a sarcastic tone. additionally, ""everyone is equal"" and ""we all end up 6 foot under (so to speak) in the end"" are presented in a way that suggests irony and a critical view of the issues discussed.

step 2: true intention - the sentence questions the consistency of legal decisions over time (e.g., on abortion and the death penalty for minors) and equality. the phrase ""i guess now it is???"" points out the perceived arbitrariness of legal interpretations sarcastically, and ""those are obviously not my beliefs"" seems to mockingly clarify a misinterpretation.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment (skeptical and critical tone) matches the true intention (sarcasm about the inconsistency and perceived arbitrariness of constitutional interpretations and social issues). the usage of rhetorical questions and mocking tone highlights satire and sarcasm.",1

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?,0,"
### Example:
Input:
false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be polite and inquisitive. the phrases ""sounds pretty neat,"" and ""i'll keep it in mind for a road trip"" suggest politeness or mild interest, while the latter part of the input seems curious and open to learning: ""so you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time?"" and ""so what information do you have to share with us about this idea?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention here seems to contain a mix of skepticism and inquisitiveness. the way the question is framed (""so you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time?"") indicates skepticism, which may imply the speaker finds this belief unusual or unlikely. the phrasing and style, especially since it follows polite statements, could potentially be setting up a sarcastic response, questioning the validity of the belief.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the polite surface sentiment and the skeptical true intention align to suggest sarcasm, especially in the context of questioning a widely debunked belief. the polite lead-in potentially hides a critical or mocking sentiment.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""why don't you just sum it up with...""
  - ""you also fail to consider...""
- the use of these phrases suggests a critical yet straightforward inquiry.
- no positive or negative sentimental phrases or emojis indicating strong emotion or exaggerated expression.

**step 2: true intention**
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language is direct and lacks a humorous or exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.
  - the intention appears to be informative and corrective, rather than mocking or ironically contradicting a perceived stupidity or misunderstanding.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical assessment or an attempt to correct a perceived oversight.
  - the true intention matches this assessment without any underlying irony or sarcasm.
- **inference:**
  - given the direct nature of the critique and the absence of exaggerated or ironic signals, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

  - ""either a gross misunderstanding""
  - ""or a gross misrepresentation""
- the use of ""gross"" twice suggests a strong, emotionally charged opinion. the repetition and choice of words could indicate a harsh critique or disdainful statement.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the sentence uses a strong contrast (""either...or"") to highlight two negative possibilities about the understanding of evolutionary theory.
  - the tone appears to be critical and dismissive, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm. the repeated use of ""gross"" suggests the author believes the situation is absurdly incorrect in an exaggerated manner.
  
### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment is harshly critical, which can often align with sarcasm.
  - the true intention appears to be to mock the understanding or representation of evolutionary theory.

- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.

yes it does but i have a feeling that it will take the bulldozer of the scotus to make the 11 dominoes of the old confederacy +utah fall down.

i'll proceed step by step:

### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""bulldozer of the scotus,"" ""11 dominoes of the old confederacy + utah""
- the use of ""bulldozer"" suggests a need for a forceful intervention, implying some resistance or difficulty.
- ""11 dominoes of the old confederacy + utah"" appears to reference states with certain historical or cultural contexts, possibly those resistant to change.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence seems to imply that even though something does function as expected (possibly referring to a law or policy), the actual implementation or acceptance of this functioning will require significant force from the supreme court.
- the term ""bulldozer"" is used metaphorically to describe the scotus needing to exert considerable effort, which conveys a sense of irony or frustration about the resistant nature of these states.
- the sentence can be interpreted as having an exaggerated view of the difficulty involved, suggesting a sarcastic undertone when mentioning the scotus needing to act as a ""bulldozer.""

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment shows a mixture of a factual statement with an ironic twist.
- true intention reveals a deeper layer of sarcasm, implying that the intervention of the scotus should normally be unnecessary but is humorously exaggerated as essential.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text is neutral and analytical. it discusses ideas and asks a thought-provoking question without emotional or exaggerated language. there are no keywords that suggest mocking, sneering, or irony.

**step 2: true intention**
- the language used is straightforward and focused on explaining a concept regarding faith and the nature vs. nurture debate. the speaker does not use any rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradiction.

        ","### input:
now everyone will know marc was right all along--that there is an atheist science conspiracy.

### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text contains a presumable declarative statement, suggesting that ""marc was right all along"" and that it backs the idea of ""an atheist science conspiracy"". the keyword ""right all along"" can suggest past disbelief now confirmed, and ""atheist science conspiracy"" is a sensational claim.

**step 2: true intention**
- the sentence has rhetorical devices like exaggeration (""right all along""), and a controversial claim (""atheist science conspiracy""). these elements suggest irony, as it’s not typical to seriously assert such conspiracies and the phrase hints at ridiculing an outlandish idea.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment seems somewhat dramatic and the true intention likely aims to mock or ridicule the notion of an ""atheist science conspiracy"". for something to be right ""all along"" while referring to a debatable and extreme idea, it is likely the author does not genuinely believe it and instead uses sarcasm to point out its absurdity.

- the rhetorical phrase ""really?"" suggests skepticism.
- overall tone appears skeptical and confrontational.

### step 2: true intention

the surface sentiment indicates disbelief and mockery, with the use of rhetorical questions and exaggerated statements, reinforced by a rolling eyes emoticon indicating sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- the rhetorical question ""and you say i'm crazy?!"" implies that the speaker finds it absurd to be called crazy compared to someone who interrogates rocks.
- the phrase ""this guy interrogates rocks!"" is an exaggerated and mocking statement meant to highlight the absurdity of the comparison.

the speaker's true intention is to mock and dismiss the idea that they are crazy by pointing out something they view as even more ridiculous.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""step in the right direction,"" ""realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime.""
- the phrases indicate a generally positive tone towards the actions of england.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker acknowledges a potential opposition to gun control but then expresses approval that england has made a favorable decision regarding gun control.
- the phrase ""step in the right direction"" is positive, which suggests that the speaker genuinely believes in the effectiveness of england's approach.
- however, the initial clause ""so what if the author isn't arguing against gun control?"" can be seen as dismissive, potentially ironic considering the positive tone that follows.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) suggests a positive view of england's actions.
- true intention (step 2) also indicates support, but the dismissiveness of the initial clause may imply some level of irony.
- the positive follow-up contrasts with the dismissive opening, suggesting a complex blend of sentiment that could be sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

the surface sentiment is quite serious and passionate. the keywords and phrases such as ""hypocritical,"" ""pro-life,"" ""child,"" ""right to survive,"" and ""abortion is wrong"" indicate a strong opinion on the matter. there is a clear absence of emotional indicators such as mockery or humor that might generally hint towards sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the text is to argue against a perceived inconsistency in the pro-life stance. it presents a logical, argumentative style and uses serious language. there is no use of rhetorical devices like hyperbole or irony that usually signal sarcasm. the language style is direct and emphasizes the speaker's belief.

""so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body. what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. the genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc. the body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the dna sequence.""

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** no evident use of sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices that would hint at a different meaning from the literal one.
   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention align closely, presenting a straightforward, factual argument.
   - **final inference:** given the alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention, the final sarcasm label for this text is firmly **not sarcastic**.

- **sentimental phrases:** neutral phrases discussing debate structures and a welcome message.
- **surface sentiment:** neutral and informative

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""welcome to the forum"" might imply a sarcastic undertone, given the context might suggest a dismissive attitude towards the debate proposal.
- **language style:** the statement appears to juxtapose a formal debate with a casual discussion, potentially in a dismissive or sarcastic manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention might hint at sarcasm, especially with the seemingly out-of-place ""welcome to the forum"", which might indicate the speaker is downplaying the seriousness of the discussion.

- these words and phrases imply a dismissive and critical tone.
- the repetitive ""you could"" phrases indicate a sarcastic suggestion that the person being addressed is either not capable or not willing to provide a proper argument.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence is heavily criticizing the addressee for not presenting a fair argument or credible statistics.
- the use of the repetitive ""you could"" suggests that the speaker believes the addressee has failed to meet basic standards of argumentation.
- the concluding phrase ""require not being a rightwing parrot"" is clearly meant to insult and degrade the addressee, implying that they are unoriginal and merely echo right-wing talking points.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows a dismissive and critical tone, using rhetorical questions to mock the addressee.
- the true intention aligns with this, using sarcasm to highlight perceived incompetence and bias in the addressee's arguments.
- both the surface sentiment and true intention indicate a clear use of sarcasm to belittle the addressee.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

  - ""the glory of the internet doth provide"" uses mock-formality (""doth""), suggesting irony or mock-seriousness.
- the true intention seems to blend correction with a tone that implicitly criticizes or humorously highlights common knowledge through the internet.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment involves correcting a mistake and indicating where one can find more information.
  - the tone, particularly the use of ""doth"" and the contradictory statement ""i'm not sure but i'm sure that someone is,"" points towards an ironic or mocking sentiment.
- given the contradictory statement, archaic language style, and the possible condescending tone in the phrase structure, the overall language style leans more towards irony than straightforward correction.

"Well, you have ""proved"" that the U.S. health insurance does not have any higher administrative cost than Medicare or the rest od the industrialized world.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases indicate a questioning and possibly critical tone.
- the use of quotations around ""junk dna"" suggests skepticism or disbelief in the term.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker appears to be questioning the validity of the arguments against the design of the vertebrate eye.
- the rhetorical device of repeating ""why? why is it a bad design?"" emphasizes the speaker’s skepticism towards the criticisms.
- the illustrative mention of ""bona fide optical fibers"" further supports the speaker’s intent to underscore the good design aspects.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) shows skepticism and questioning regarding the argument that the vertebrate eye is a bad design.
- true intention (step 2) confirms that the speaker is skeptical of the arguments suggesting bad design and believes in the good design of the vertebrate eye.
- the skepticism and rhetorical questions suggest that the speaker is subtly mocking or casting doubt on the criticisms, which aligns with a sarcastic tone.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the keywords and phrases include ""constantly posting statements,"" ""anti-gun officials,"" ""called into question,"" ""challenged,"" and ""nothing to post in defense.""
- these words imply criticism and frustration. the tone appears accusatory and critical.
- there are no sentimental phrases or emojis suggesting emotional exaggeration or irony, but the choice of words like ""constantly"" and ""nothing to post in defense"" suggest a negative tone.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence addresses the actions of a person who frequently posts statements by anti-gun officials but fails to defend those statements when challenged.
- the tone seems to be pointing out perceived hypocrisy or inability to defend one's stance.
- there is a rhetorical device at play here: the use of the phrase ""nothing to post in defense"" could be seen as pointing out a supposed flaw, which can carry a sarcastic undertone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows criticism and accusation.
- the true intention indicates pointing out the perceived inability to defend one's position, bordering on making the subject look foolish or naïve.
- the use of phrases like ""nothing to post in defense"" can be sarcastic, emphasizing the person's failure in a mocking way.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""freedom of speech is doomed"", ""harassment is subjective"", ""claim that a book i don't like is harassing me"", ""will be banned"".
- **tone:** the tone is concerned and critical, suggesting a bleak consequence (""doomed"", ""banned"").

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** hyperbole (""freedom of speech is doomed"") and reductio ad absurdum (suggesting an extreme and unlikely situation to criticize a position) are prominent here.
- **language style:** the statements are exaggerated to convey skepticism or disapproval about the idea being discussed (possibly related to censorship or subjective interpretations of harassment).

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- while the surface sentiment appears serious and critical, the exaggerated nature of the statements and the use of reductio ad absurdum reveal that the true intention is to mock a viewpoint by suggesting extreme, unlikely outcomes.
- the implied meaning opposes the literal statements, indicative of sarcasm. the speaker doesn't truly believe that ""freedom of speech is doomed"" or that subjective harassment claims will lead to banning books.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""that's certainly your right,"" ""hawking a religious agenda,"" ""not a scientific one,"" ""disguised as a scientific one,"" ""a perusal of his posts here bely that desire.""
- **tone:** the tone seems critical with a potential undertone of sarcasm, especially given the word choices aimed at discrediting someone's intentions.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""that's certainly your right"" can be read as a polite preface to a critical statement, often a hallmark of sarcastic framing. the phrase ""hawking a religious agenda"" suggests contempt or disapproval.
- **language style:** the word ""hawking"" carries a negative connotation, implying aggressive promotion, while ""disguised as a scientific one"" suggests deceit or misrepresentation.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and straightforward initially, but upon deeper analysis, the true intention reveals a critical and potentially sarcastic undertone. phrases like ""that's certainly your right"" used in this context are often sarcastic, indicating a dismissal of the other person's position under the guise of respect.

Steps:

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Well then, have at it. The theme of the day was weddings. Almost everything taught that day, except for this one story, was about heterosexual marriage. Go on, show us your argument against teaching kids about how this society organizes familes.   Your opposition to this, homo- or heterosexual, is so obviously contrived. School is there to help socialize children and instruct them in how to be good members of this society, AND YOU KNOW IT. The idea that you would prefer them to ignore discussions of family -- while you simultaneously assert that this society rests on the family and tradition -- is ludicrous.   Come on, jyoshu, you don't have to argue this one... we won't tell your supervisor.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment
the statement appears confrontational and dismissive. phrases such as ""show us your argument,"" ""obviously contrived,"" ""and you know it,"" and ""ludicrous"" indicate a strong emotional tone. the use of capital letters and direct address to ""jyoshu"" further emphasize an aggressive and mocking stance.

step 2: true intention
the true intention of the statement is to criticize and undermine ""jyoshu's"" argument against teaching children about family structures. the rhetorical questions and exaggerated disbelief (""we won't tell your supervisor"") suggest that the speaker finds the opposing viewpoint to be ridiculous and not worthy of serious debate.

step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of mockery and confrontation matches the true intention of belittling the opposing argument. the exaggerated tone, rhetorical questions, and strong emotional language indicate that the statement is sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
""so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body. what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. the genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc. the body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the dna sequence.""

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** no evident use of sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices that would hint at a different meaning from the literal one.
   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention align closely, presenting a straightforward, factual argument.
   - **final inference:** given the alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention, the final sarcasm label for this text is firmly **not sarcastic**.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","given the nature of the input, let's analyze it step by step to ensure the correct classification of sarcasm.

### step-by-step analysis

#### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- **keywords/phrases:**
  - ""acknowledged""
  - ""most people will realize""
  - ""unlikely""
  - ""natural selection""
  - ""ever actually created anything""
- **sentimental phrases:**
  - the sentence has a speculative tone, as indicated by ""suspect"" and ""unlikely.""
- **surface sentiment:**
  - the statement appears to be doubtful about the efficacy of natural selection in creating anything.

#### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:**
  - there is a hint of skepticism or disbelief in natural selection creating anything.
  - the use of ""most people will realize it is unlikely"" suggests an underlying criticism or disbelief.
- **language style:**
  - the sentence has a mildly dismissive and speculative language style, possibly insinuating that natural selection's role in creation is overstated.
- **true intention:**
  - the true intention appears to be to cast doubt on the principle of natural selection with an undertone of criticism.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment of doubt aligns with the true intention of skepticism towards natural selection.
  - the tone, structure, and choice of words suggest that there is an underlying sarcasm, aiming to mock the validity of natural selection through the guise of speculative doubt.

### final inference
- given the sarcastic nature implied by the skepticism and the rhetorical structure of the sentence, the label is **sarcastic**.

### label:

"Well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences.",0,"
### Example:
Input:
i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a sincere expression of agreement and understanding. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be defensive or slightly aggressive. the phrase ""well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you?"" suggests a challenging tone. the phrase ""each woman who has an abortion could have innumerous circumstances and experiences"" comes off as presenting facts. there are no emojis or overtly sentimental phrases.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence seems to be emphasizing that the speaker's experiences are unique and that generalizing about abortion is inappropriate because each woman has different circumstances. the rhetorical question ""well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you?"" is dismissive of the other person's opinion, suggesting a defensive stance rather than a straightforward discussion.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment matches the true intention of defending personal experiences and highlighting the uniqueness of each person's situation. while the tone is challenging and somewhat dismissive, it does not exhibit clear signs of sarcasm such as irony or understatement aimed at mockery.

"amen, brother! stay as far from new ideas as possible, and no one will come between you and your stories!",0,"
### Example:
Input:
""why don't you just sum it up with 'if you're not a fundamentalist christian'? you also fail to consider christian agnostics.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""why don't you just sum it up with...""
  - ""you also fail to consider...""
- the use of these phrases suggests a critical yet straightforward inquiry.
- no positive or negative sentimental phrases or emojis indicating strong emotion or exaggerated expression.

**step 2: true intention**
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language is direct and lacks a humorous or exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.
  - the intention appears to be informative and corrective, rather than mocking or ironically contradicting a perceived stupidity or misunderstanding.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical assessment or an attempt to correct a perceived oversight.
  - the true intention matches this assessment without any underlying irony or sarcasm.
- **inference:**
  - given the direct nature of the critique and the absence of exaggerated or ironic signals, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""amen, brother!""
  - ""stay as far from new ideas as possible""
  - ""no one will come between you and your stories!""
- the phrases ""stay as far from new ideas as possible"" and ""no one will come between you and your stories!"" imply a form of critique.
- the exclamation marks and phrasing give an appearance of strong enthusiasm, which may be insincere.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the use of ""amen, brother!"" and the structure of the phrases suggest an exaggerated tone, often linked with sarcasm.
  - the statement to ""stay as far from new ideas as possible"" is unlikely to be sincere encouragement, as it criticizes the subject for being closed-minded.
  - the expression ""no one will come between you and your stories!"" likely mocks the subject's adherence to outdated or unchallenged beliefs.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment shows enthusiasm and agreement, but the language and context suggest the opposite. 
  - the true intention is to criticize and mock, as the exaggeration and insincerity imply irony.

"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment of the text is highly informative and academic. keywords such as ""describe,"" ""mechanical forces,"" ""teleological,"" and ""volitional discrimination"" suggest a detailed explanation meant to clarify a specific point about the concept of selection. there is no use of emotional or sentimental phrases, and the language remains formal and precise.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the speaker is to provide a thorough and reasoned argument regarding the nature of selection versus channeling and sorting in a philosophical or scientific context. the use of formal language and the detailed breakdown of concepts indicate an intent to educate or clarify rather than to mock or ridicule. there are no rhetorical devices that suggest irony or sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
both the surface sentiment and the true intention indicate that the speaker is focused on delivering a factual and rational explanation. there is no indication of sarcasm, as the language remains formal and devoid of irony or mockery.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** yes, of course, illegal, possibly a felony, forfeiture of your rights.
- **sentimental phrases:** ""yes, of course"" is indicative of a potential sarcastic tone.
- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** the phrase ""yes, of course"" suggests sarcasm, while the rest of the text is factual and legalistic.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **language style:** the initial phrase is informal (""yes, of course""), followed by a factual and legalistic explanation regarding hunting and legal consequences.
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""yes, of course"" can be interpreted as sarcasm given the context that follows.
- **true intention:** the speaker might be using sarcasm to criticize or highlight the irony in the situation regarding the legality of hunting and its serious repercussions.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment suggests a sarcastic opening, while the true intention seems to point out an ironic or absurd situation regarding the legality of hunting.
- **inference:** the opening phrase ""yes, of course"" likely indicates the speaker's sarcastic tone towards the situation described.

- keywords and phrases: ""actually,"" ""should be easily,"" ""no facts, no evidence, no proof, just emotion.""
- these words and phrases collectively imply a baseline criticism directed at someone labeled as ""vor.""
- the phrase ""should be easily to relate"" suggests a lowered expectation of difficulty or effort in this context.
- repetition of ""no facts, no evidence, no proof, just emotion"" emphasizes the criticism and suggests discontent with the manner of argumentation.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to criticize ""vor"" for only arguing with emotion rather than logic or evidence.
- the phrasing ""should be easily to relate"" could be interpreted as a veiled insult, indirectly stating that the behavior is obvious or expected.
- the repetition and structure of ""no facts, no evidence, no proof, just emotion"" imply dismissive and ridiculing sentiment, indicating a likely sarcastic tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention both signal a critical and almost contemptuous attitude towards ""vor.""
- the use of repetitive and absolute phrases (""no facts,"" ""no evidence,"" ""no proof,"" ""just emotion"") often suggests hyperbolic and exaggerated criticism, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- the mention of evil individuals like ""hitler"" and ""kkk"" suggests a strong negative sentiment towards these groups.
- the remark about ""our own friend archie here"" appears to be a critical attack couched within a serious tone, hinting at a possible sarcastic undertone directed towards archie.

### step 2: true intention:
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language is predominantly serious, discussing concepts of good and evil and religious beliefs.
  - the inclusion of ""our own friend archie"" within a list of hate promoters spins a seemingly serious discussion into a potential sarcastic jab at archie.
  - the phrase ""sad to say"" indicates a sense of resignation or disapproval, further emphasizing the critique of archie.
- the true intention appears to critique or condemn archie's behavior by comparing him to universally despised figures, which suggests sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment shows a serious, critical tone regarding moral and religious beliefs.
  - the true intention of singling out ""our own friend archie here"" leans toward sarcasm by juxtaposing him with hateful figures like hitler and the kkk, not to convey genuine similarities but to mock or criticize archie.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the keywords and phrases include ""healthy families,"" ""seems like a strange name.""
- the use of the word ""strange"" suggests a negative connotation about the appropriateness of the name.
- there is an indication of disbelief or questioning nature regarding the name ""healthy families.""

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase implies that the name ""healthy families"" is not suitable or does not match the characteristics of the group being referred to.
- the sentence uses mild irony by suggesting that ""healthy families"" is an inappropriate name in a subtle way.
- the sentence employs a rhetorical device by contrasting the expectation of the name (""healthy families"") with the reality of what the group represents.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains a hint of irony through the choice of words like ""strange"" to question the name's appropriateness.
- the true intention reveals a subtle critique, implying that the name ""healthy families"" is misleading or inappropriate.
- the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention indicates the use of mild sarcasm to convey the message.

Steps:  
step 1: surface sentiment - the statement appears analytical and critical, containing phrases such as ""we don't have free will"" and ""we are forced."" there is no exaggerated or mocking tone, nor are there sentimental phrases or emojis typically associated with sarcasm.

step 2: true intention - the sentence straightforwardly argues against the notion of free will under divine constraint. the language is literal and lacks the rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment matches the true intention, as both convey a serious argument without any underlying sarcasm.

        ","### label: sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment - the statement mentions the ""fsm school of creationsim,"" which refers to the satirical religion of the flying spaghetti monster, implying a mocking tone. 

step 2: true intention - the mention of support for the fsm school, which is widely known as satire, and the suggestion it could be a ""suitable compromise"" imply that the speaker does not genuinely believe this to be a serious option. this is a rhetorical device to mock the debate about creationism in schools.

step 3: comparison and analysis - the surface sentiment of mockery and the true intention to deride or mock certain viewpoints align, indicating the statement is sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....""
  - ""probably upon a pole reversal.""
- the use of ""actually"" can suggest a correction or contrast with someone else’s statement.
- the multiple periods (""....."") can indicate a pause for effect, possibly hinting at disbelief or mockery.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the sentence appears to challenge or mock a previous statement.
  - the repetition of ""probably"" and the subject matter (drifting much faster and pole reversal) are unusual, suggesting an exaggeration.
  - the pause created by multiple periods may emphasize the incredulity or facetiousness of the statement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment appears somewhat dismissive and potentially incredulous.
  - analyzing the true intention, the use of ""actually"" with exaggeration implies that the speaker may be sarcastically refuting an earlier claim.
- **inference:**
  - given the skeptical tone, exaggeration, and language style, the sentence is likely sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **tone:** the tone is accusatory and indignant, with strong negative emotional language.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses rhetorical questions and exclamations to express disbelief and condemnation. the phrase ""good god!"" emphasizes the shock and moral outrage. the concluding remark ""no wonder you don't like guns and want to see everyone disarmed!"" suggests that the writer finds the initial statement absurd or hypocritical.
- **language style:** the style is sarcastic, as it implies the opposite of what it says to criticize or mock the other person for what the writer perceives as a contradiction or absurdity.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is strong disapproval and indignation.
- the true intention uses sarcastic language to mock and criticize, implying that the initial statement about taking pleasure in inflicting pain is absurd.

the statement contains a blend of frustration and personal experience. phrases such as ""you people whine at me"" and the use of the emoticon ""emoticonxcry"" indicate irritation. 

### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be a serious argument about abortion, particularly late-term abortion, with the person providing personal context about being born prematurely. the emoticon underscores frustration with perceived hypocrisy while presenting a serious view on the issue.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment suggests a mix of irritation and seriousness. the emoticon ""emoticonxcry"" can imply a mocking tone towards those complaining about personal insults. however, the rest of the sentence aims to present a serious argument against late-term abortion. 

given the mocking tone at the beginning and the serious argument presented afterward, the initial sentiment might lean towards sarcasm.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence seems to be to clarify or underscore the importance of organized or well-structured evidence in forming a theory. the repeated emphasis on ""evidence"" suggests an attempt to stress the difference between mere collection of evidence and constructing it into a coherent theory. the phrase ""again, it's not just"" implies a rebuttal or reinforcement of a previously made point.

- the surface sentiment appears neutral to skeptical. there are no overtly positive or negative emotional indicators. the use of questioning phrases like ""how many animals do you think were on the ark?"" and stating that the story ""does not coincide with contemporary science"" suggests some level of skepticism.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to be questioning the factual accuracy and scientific compatibility of the story of the ark. the mention of ""contemporary science"" and the comparison with ""the rest of genesis"" indicates a critical tone towards the literal interpretation of the ark story. there's also a reference to specific biblical text which might imply the person is engaging in a critical or analytical discussion.

### step 3: compare and analyze

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Your statement is a logical fallacy. It is not proof but simply illogical. The fallacy is called the fallacy of inconsistency. You argue from two contradictory premises. 1) God is all Powerful, 2) God can not do something.You state one as the conclusion of the other but that is just a funny way of stating two premises. The statement is illogical. Look up your favorite text on logical fallacies and you will see that I am right.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment indicates a critical and corrective stance. keywords and phrases like ""logical fallacy,"" ""illogical,"" ""fallacy of inconsistency,"" ""two contradictory premises,"" and ""look up"" show a tone of correction and instruction. the use of ""funny way"" might have a subtle hint of sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention is to critique and refute the argument presented by another person. the speaker uses definitive language and references logical principles to assert their correctness. the phrase ""look up"" suggests the speaker feels confident and superior in their knowledge, possibly intended to make the other person feel less informed.

### step 3: compare and analyze
the surface sentiment and the true intention both aim to correct and instruct, with a potential undercurrent of superiority or mockery, particularly in the way the speaker suggests looking up logical fallacies. the phrase ""funny way"" could be interpreted as dismissive and subtly sarcastic.

"Well, yes, the idea of an omnipotent being with a definable physical (or even mental) form has always struck me as a little... odd.",0,"
### Example:
Input:
false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment suggests a puzzled or skeptical stance. the use of ""well, yes"" and ""a little... odd"" indicates a subtle expression of incredulity or disbelief. 

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention appears to be to mock the concept of an omnipotent being having a definable form. the use of ellipsis (""a little... odd"") and the phrasing ""has always struck me"" injects a tone of understatement that implies a stronger disbelief or ridicule.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment hints at skepticism with a subtle hint of ridicule, while the true intention reveals a mocking attitude towards the idea being discussed. the understated tone and specific choice of words align with common indicators of sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be indignant or morally outraged. keywords like ""murdered her child"" and the emphasis on laws against ""killing your pre-birth children"" reflect a strong disapproval of abortion.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the strong and emotive language (""murdered,"" ""killing"") is indicative of a highly charged opinion against abortion. the true intention seems to be to express a strong anti-abortion stance, emphasizing a moral equivalency between abortion and murder.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with an earnest expression of moral outrage against abortion. there aren't any clues of exaggerated irony, mocking tone, or any elements that typically signify sarcasm.

  - ""why don't you just sum it up with...""
  - ""you also fail to consider...""
- the use of these phrases suggests a critical yet straightforward inquiry.
- no positive or negative sentimental phrases or emojis indicating strong emotion or exaggerated expression.

**step 2: true intention**
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language is direct and lacks a humorous or exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.
  - the intention appears to be informative and corrective, rather than mocking or ironically contradicting a perceived stupidity or misunderstanding.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical assessment or an attempt to correct a perceived oversight.
  - the true intention matches this assessment without any underlying irony or sarcasm.
- **inference:**
  - given the direct nature of the critique and the absence of exaggerated or ironic signals, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""not once""
  - ""i don't 'choose'""
  - ""i have to assume""
- the use of all caps in ""choose"" might suggest an emphasis on the word, potentially indicative of underlying frustration or an attempt to correct a misconception.
- the text overall is explanatory and provides a reasoned argument.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the language is mostly straightforward and explains the speaker's perspective on sexual attraction.
  - the use of ""i have to assume"" suggests the speaker is concluding based on personal and observed experiences.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment suggests an intent to explain and clarify the speaker's perspective on sexual attraction.
  - the true intention aligns with this, showing an informative and corrective tone without sarcastic elements.
- **inference:**
  - given the clear and reasoned style of the communication, without signs of irony, exaggeration, or mockery, the text is best labeled as ""not sarcastic.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text is neutral and analytical. it discusses ideas and asks a thought-provoking question without emotional or exaggerated language. there are no keywords that suggest mocking, sneering, or irony.

**step 2: true intention**

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the text presents factual statements and references scientific evidence. it uses terms like ""speciation,"" ""natural selection,"" ""fossile record,"" and ""dna."" it appears educational and informative at first glance.

### step 2: true intention
- the text contains some problematic phrases: ""bacteria, birds etcs,"" and ""natural selection occures frequently."" the misspelling ""fossile"" and use of quotation marks around ""observe"" suggests skepticism or mocking. the phrase ""ergo, it's good"" feels flippant and out of place in a truly scientific discussion, implying a dismissive tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment seems mostly neutral and factual, but the true intention reveals subtle mocking, particularly with the use of quotes and casual language in concluding (""ergo, it's good""). this contradiction between surface factual presentation and underlying dismissive tone is characteristic of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.

### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- **keywords/phrases:** ""theory of evolution"", ""natural selection"", ""evidence"", ""support"", ""faulty"".
- **sentimental phrases:** ""i will present the theory of evolution by natural selection"", ""evidence has been shown to support it"", ""your assertion... has been shown to be faulty"".
- **surface sentiment:** the text appears to be argumentative, providing scientific evidence to counter an opposing view.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** the text seems to contain a level of sarcasm, particularly in the last sentence, ""your assertion that organisms are 'devolving' because of mutations has been shown to be faulty,"" which comes across as dismissive and critical.
- **language style:** the style is formal but with a confrontational tone, implying that the opposing view is not credible.
- **true intention:** the writer is likely expressing skepticism and criticism towards the opposing argument, suggesting that it has no scientific validity.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is argumentative and factual, but the true intention reveals a critical and dismissive attitude, hinting at sarcasm.
- **final inference:** given the alignment of the critical and dismissive tone with the true intention, it suggests that the text is sarcastic.

i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

- the surface sentiment appears to be slightly negative and exasperated. keywords such as ""a few dozen times now"" suggest a sense of repetition and annoyance. the smiley face emoji "":)"" often adds a layer of irony or sarcasm in this context.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention seems to be highlighting the redundancy and irritation of having to repeat something numerous times. the use of a rhetorical question and the exaggeration ""a few dozen times now"" implies that the speaker is frustrated and possibly mocking the listener for not remembering.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention suggest a mocking and irritated tone, reinforced by the rhetorical question and the smiley face emoji.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment seems confrontational and questioning. the phrase ""so what if,"" rhetorical questions, and the repetition of the question about instincts being natural suggest a critical tone. it's probing and slightly dismissive of previous arguments.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention appears to be challenging previous statements about instincts and natural behavior. the speaker is attempting to provoke thought or highlight a perceived inconsistency in the argument, possibly with a hint of frustration or skepticism about the previous points.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the critical tone, rhetorical questions, and slightly dismissive nature of the response suggest that the speaker might be using sarcasm to undermine or ridicule the previous argument. the use of ""pretty much everything we do is instinctual"" might be a hyperbolic statement to accentuate the argument.

### Example:
Input:
""so you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe it's true! get real baby even you don't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""

Steps:
### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement is complex and contains a mix of sentiments. there are phrases that express concern (""if you love your freedom and the choices you now have, you should pay attention to islam"") and a critique of a perceived threat (“consumed with a hatred for the west” and “dedicated to their cause”). however, there are also mocking or hyperbolic elements in the phrase “symbiote declares this the worst thread ever” which could indicate a sarcastic tone. 

### step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to be a warning about the perceived threat of islam to the western way of life. the writer appears to be serious about the concern, but the hyperbolic statement might be intended to mock or discredit a specific thread or argument. 

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is mixed but leans towards serious concern.
- the true intention is to warn about a perceived threat, with an element of mockery.
- the hyperbolic statement (""symbiote declares this the worst thread ever"") suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a sincere expression of agreement and understanding. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

### steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral. terms like ""allegorical/metaphorical"" and ""abiogenesis"" indicate a discussion about concepts, while the phrase ""just haven't understood"" could suggest a subtle critique or explanation.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the sentence seems to imply that creationists have a misunderstanding about an allegorical or metaphorical reference to abiogenesis. the use of ""just haven't understood"" carries a tone that may suggest a critique of the creationists' ability to grasp complex concepts, which could imply sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- although the surface sentiment is neutral, the underlying suggestion that creationists ""just haven't understood"" carries a critical tone that could be interpreted as sarcastic. the phrasing implies that understanding should be obvious or simple, which adds an element of irony.

### step 2: true intention
- the statement posits that the best explanation currently available by scientists might be surpassed by an even better naturalistic explanation, rather than invoking divine intervention. this could be a critique of the tendency to invoke supernatural explanations when natural ones are not yet fully satisfactory. the contrast presented between natural explanations and divine intervention can imply a subtle mockery of the latter.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

### step-by-step analysis:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment is highly critical and emotionally charged. words and phrases like ""hi-jacking,"" ""nine month rape,"" ""screams,"" ""absurd,"" and ""insulting"" suggest intense negativity and outrage towards the subject being discussed.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentences is to strongly condemn the idea that women's choices on abortion are driven by negative or simplistic motives, such as revenge. the language is direct, emphatic, and rhetorical, aiming to persuade and arouse strong emotions against those who diminish or mischaracterize women’s reproductive choices.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase ""we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more"" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing.

        ","### step-by-step analysis

#### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- **keywords/phrases:** ""right to form families"", ""oppression"", ""conservative family types"", ""closet"", ""mad as hell"", ""camps"", ""lock and exterminate gay people"", ""final solution"", ""conservatives and religious right nuts"", ""sub human sickos"".
- **sentimental phrases:** the text uses highly emotive language and phrases that convey strong negative feelings towards the opinions and actions attributed to ""conservative"" views, especially in relation to gay people. 
- **surface sentiment:** strongly negative and confrontational.

#### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** the text employs a lot of rhetorical devices such as hyperbole (""comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people"", ""final solution""), and analogy/comparison (""that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution"").
- **language style:** the language is provocative and emotive, aiming to highlight the perceived extremism and dangers of conservative views toward gay people.
- **true intention:** to criticize and condemn the conservative stance on gay rights by drawing extreme analogies and expressing strong opposition.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and true intention are aligned and convey a strong condemnation of conservative views toward gay rights. while the text is clearly confrontational and uses rhetorical exaggeration, it does not exhibit a sarcastic tone.
- **final inference:** given that the text is direct in its condemnation without veiling its message in sarcasm, the final label for this text is firmly **not sarcastic**.

""but...but...   i just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. now i'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   as to driving...don't care.   what i'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. there's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. you saying they can't do that?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

**keywords/phrases**: ""if anti-gunners can pass a law,"" ""require a background check,"" ""what prevents them,"" ""simply walking out to the parking lot.""

### step 2
**true intention**: the language suggests a critique or skepticism toward the efficacy of gun control laws, specifically background checks for private gun sales. the rhetorical questioning (""what prevents them"") implies that the author doubts these laws will be effective in preventing sales outside gun shows.

**rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions and conditional statements (""if... then..."") suggests the author believes that such laws will be circumvented. there’s a hint of sarcasm in the implication that the laws are futile.

### step 3

  - the language is direct and lacks a humorous or exaggerated tone often associated with sarcasm.
  - the intention appears to be informative and corrective, rather than mocking or ironically contradicting a perceived stupidity or misunderstanding.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical assessment or an attempt to correct a perceived oversight.
  - the true intention matches this assessment without any underlying irony or sarcasm.
- **inference:**
  - given the direct nature of the critique and the absence of exaggerated or ironic signals, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""so what?""
  - ""that means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition...""
  - phrases like ""ripe for the picking"" suggest a level of casualness and dismissiveness about a serious matter.
- **sentimental phrases or emojis:**
  - the casual and dismissive tone indicates a non-literal, possibly sarcastic attitude.

### step 2: true intention
- **language style and rhetorical devices:**
  - the phrase ""so what?"" dismisses the importance of the preceding argument.
  - the expression ""ripe for the picking"" trivializes the situation, suggesting an ironic contradiction.
- **true intention:**
  - the speaker is attempting to downplay the seriousness of criminals running out of ammunition in a firefight, using irony to criticize the idea being presented.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment of dismissiveness and trivialization suggests a non-serious approach to the topic.
  - the true intention is ironic criticism, aimed at emphasizing the perceived absurdity of the situation.

Steps:
### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

- includes skeptical, critical and somewhat condescending language.
- overall sentiment suggests skepticism and criticism of brady.

#### step 2: true intention
- the speaker appears to be criticizing brady for not providing evidence and for using unverified arguments, which suggests skepticism towards brady’s claims.
- phrases like ""fairly accurate summation,"" ""i won't fault you,"" and ""just more cut and paste"" are likely used sarcastically to imply the opposite of their literal meaning.

- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** defensive and questioning.

step 2: true intention deduction
- **language style:** assertive and possibly defensive.
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of contrast (""i've been in a loving, committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively"") paired with the rhetorical question (""how does this have a negative affect on you?"") suggests a challenge.
- **true intention:** to defend their position and challenge the opposing viewpoint, possibly implying the absurdity of the opposing stance.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** surface sentiment appears defensive and questioning, while true intention suggests a challenge and potential sarcasm, given the rhetorical question and the context.
- **inference:** the strong defense coupled with the rhetorical device indicates a likelihood of sarcasm aimed at undermining the opposing view.

the surface sentiment indicates a strong and critical stance on the topic of abortion. keywords such as ""pregnant woman,"" ""child does not have a choice,"" and ""killing someone"" convey a strong opposition to abortion. the phrase ""forcing your view of 'choice' on me"" suggests frustration and a defensive tone. the language is emotive and judgmental.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention of the speaker is to express a firm belief against abortion by framing it as murder and criticizing the concept of choice in this context. the use of rhetorical devices like emphasizing ""choice"" (with quotation marks) aims to undermine the validity of pro-choice arguments. the speaker is not aiming to mock but to strongly assert their moral stance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
both the surface sentiment and the true intention exhibit a serious and emotionally charged viewpoint against abortion without any signs of irony, exaggeration, or mocking that are typical in sarcasm.

### step-by-step analysis
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases:
  - ""or maybe it was his reaction""
  - ""lowest number of homicides since 1966""
  - ""the facts aren't on your side, brady.""
  - ""this is probably the only thing obama ever did politically that i agree with.""
- the sentence starts with a speculation, references a positive outcome (""lowest number of homicides""), asserts a factual argument (""the facts aren't on your side""), and makes a begrudging admission about obama.
- the phrase ""this is probably the only thing obama ever did politically that i agree with"" can be construed as an indirect criticism masked as faint praise.

**step 2: true intention**
- the overall sentence seems to be dismissive of the opposition (addressed as brady).
- the phrase, ""this is probably the only thing obama ever did politically that i agree with,"" likely conveys a sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker usually disagrees with obama, revealing a critical undertone.
- ""or maybe it was his reaction to the outcome of heller vs. dc"" suggests a facetious guessing and ""the facts aren't on your side, brady"" dismisses the opponent's argument strongly, adding to the sarcastic tone.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment contains rhetorical devices suggesting skepticism and criticism.
- the true intention is to mockingly critique both brady (assumed opposition) and obama.
- given these, the overall tone of the sentence tilts towards sarcasm because it subtly undermines its apparent admission and dismisses the opposition's standpoint.

the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ### Input:
        Well let's put it this way. I really like playing baseball. So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they're in a position where it will threaten their life. Since it's such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed, right?

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment indicates a seemingly positive and enthusiastic stance about playing baseball. keywords and phrases such as ""i really like playing baseball,"" ""such a wonderful thing,"" and ""no one should have any problem"" suggest a positive sentiment. however, the exaggerated and hyperbolic nature of the statements (""put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball"") hints at a possibility of irony.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention, upon closer inspection, reveals that the speaker is likely using sarcasm to critique or ridicule the idea of enforcing personal preferences or beliefs on others. the absurdity of implementing a law that mandates playing baseball, regardless of one's individual circumstances, serves as a rhetorical device to highlight the ridiculousness of the premise, making it clear that the speaker is not genuinely advocating for such a law.

### step 3: compare and analysis
the surface sentiment's seemingly enthusiastic tone about playing baseball contrasts starkly with the underlying intention of mocking the idea of enforcing such a law. the exaggerated and hyperbolic language style is a clear indicator of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""but...but...   i just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. now i'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   as to driving...don't care.   what i'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. there's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. you saying they can't do that?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **language style:** the style is direct, aiming to correct or clarify another statement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the use of ""well, really"" can be a subtle indicator of sarcasm, as it may suggest the speaker is about to make a pointed or ironic remark. the phrase ""you could say"" can also imply a distance from the statement, as if the speaker doesn’t fully stand by it. this combination suggests a likelihood of sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

   - **sentimental phrases:** ""i don't have to""
   - **emojis:** ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (represents rolling eyes, often used to indicate sarcasm or disdain)
   - **surface sentiment:** dismissive and slightly arrogant.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the phrase utilizes an ironic tone, particularly with ""i don't have to"" followed by rolling eyes emoji, suggesting a sense of superiority or indifference.
   - **language style:** informal, direct, and somewhat condescending.
   - **true intention:** to mock or trivialize the perceived necessity of learning spanish or french, implying it's unnecessary just because of a focus on english.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** the use of the rolling eyes emoji and the dismissive language indicates an underlying sarcastic tone not immediately clear from the literal words.
   - **final inference:** given the dismissive language coupled with the rolling eyes emoji, the text is indicating sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a sincere expression of agreement and understanding. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

- the surface sentiment appears to be skeptical or confrontational. the word ""really?"" often indicates doubt, and ""show me that"" implies a challenge to prove a point.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention seems to be to express disbelief or doubt regarding the claim made by another person. the use of ""really?"" followed by a demand for proof suggests the speaker does not believe what was previously stated and is likely challenging the claim sarcastically.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment of skepticism and the skeptical intention both align to suggest the use of sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the text appears to have a defensive and slightly aggressive tone. it uses emphasis (""founded,"" ""remember""), which often indicates a strong stance. the statement ""you do have rights; to an extent"" adds a conditional, somewhat mocking tone concerning the extent of rights.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention behind the text seems to be criticizing or belittling someone else's viewpoint by asserting a strongly held belief. the use of capitalization (""founded"") and the conditional phrase about rights (which implies limitations) suggest irony or sarcasm. the message implies that the addressee is unaware or ignorant of a foundational belief about the country, which the speaker views as obvious.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and the true intention both indicate a sarcastic nature. the text’s use of emphasis, the conditional phrasing regarding rights, and the overall mocking tone align with a sarcastic intention. the statement implies a contradiction between perceived ignorance and an asserted reality about the country’s founding beliefs.

- **sentimental phrases:** expressions like “did not read thoroughly”, “intentional misrepresenting”, and “nothing but rambling” carry a strong negative tone.
- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** the sentiment is predominantly negative with a hint of frustration or criticism.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **language style:** the language is argumentative and confrontational, with a clear intent to refute and criticize the previous post and its understanding.
- **rhetorical devices:** there's a use of hyperbole (""nothing but rambling"") and strong dismissive language.
- **true intention:** the writer aims to criticize and discredit the previous argument, indicating frustration or annoyance but with a focus on disputing points made.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention reveal a critical and argumentative tone.
- **inference:** while the tone is critical, it does not seem sarcastic. it is more straightforward in its intent to criticize and argue against the previous points.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the text includes words and phrases such as ""buff, bluster, and bloviate,"" which have negative connotations. the use of these terms suggests a critical or mocking tone. phrases like ""well said"" may also be intended sarcastically, implying that the speaker does not actually think the statement was well made.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be to criticize or mock a group of people (referred to as ""all the profetallifers"") for avoiding meaningful discussion and instead engaging in useless rhetoric. the use of grandiloquent words like ""buff, bluster, and bloviate"" is likely intended sarcastically to amplify the criticism.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment:** the text appears critical and mocking.
- **true intention:** the speaker likely intends to criticize a group for their avoidance of meaningful discourse through sarcastic language.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment conveys a critical tone. keywords and phrases such as ""pretty poor track record"" indicate a negative assessment. the mention of specific examples adds to the criticism, suggesting specific individuals exemplify this poor track record.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention of the sentence is to criticize the expertise of electrical engineers when discussing non-electrical engineering issues. by stating ""for good reason"" and providing examples, the speaker is implying that electrical engineers often fail when they step outside their field, despite any presumed expertise they may have.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the critical tone and the construction of the sentence suggest a degree of irony or mockery. the speaker's use of ""for good reason"" can be seen as sarcastic because it undermines the notion that electrical engineers are universally competent. this mismatch between the literal statement and the underlying criticism is characteristic of sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears neutral. the statement mentions a factual point about catholics and the church's stance on evolution, without obvious emotional indicators or keywords that signal strong positive or negative sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
the sentence could imply genuine information about the church's acceptance of evolution within catholic doctrine. however, there is a potential for sarcasm, especially considering the sensitive nature of topics intertwining religion and science. the phrase ""if they're catholics"" could hint at an underlying skepticism or mockery, suggesting that the speaker might not truly believe in the compatibility of religious and scientific explanations, using a phrase that reads as a definitive fact.

### step 3: compare and analysis
1. the surface sentiment is neutral but the phrase structure and context hint subtle sarcasm, as though indicating surprise or disbelief in the church's stance.

- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the text appears to have a conflicting and complex sentiment. there are parts of it that seem to argue for discrimination based on behavior and appearance, and other parts that argue against it. words like ""discriminate"" and phrases like ""if they are flamboyantly gay... then i do favor discrimination"" indicate a negative sentiment. there are also points where the author expresses a seemingly contradictory viewpoint.

### step 2: true intention
- the language used shows contradictions and inconsistency. the speaker claims not to agree with discrimination and then contradicts himself by stating he favors discrimination if someone is flamboyantly gay. this contradictory stance, along with a potentially rhetorical question about being gay as a belief system versus being born that way, could indicate sarcasm, particularly in the context of a sensitive moral and social issue.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- both the surface sentiment and true intention show signs of conflicting viewpoints and potential rhetorical devices. the inconsistencies in the author's viewpoint on discrimination, along with the rhetorical questioning about a person's sexuality, are indicative of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

let's break it down for clarity:

step 1: surface sentiment
- there are cues that suggest a superficially neutral to slightly inquisitive tone initially, e.g., phrases like ""want to help me out here"" and explanations about geological methods. however, the phrases ""i'm sure i'm not entirely correct about these methods"" and ""i think i'd better study up on some of these qeustions here. maybe you should too"" introduce a dismissive or ironic undertone. the capitalization of ""here"" and the closing suggestion ""maybe you should too"" carries a hint of sarcasm or mockery.

step 2: true intention
- the true intention appears to be criticizing or mocking the complexity or difficulty of the geological methods described and possibly questioning the reader's understanding as well. the language style includes rhetorical devices such as implied skepticism and irony.

step 3: compare and analyze
- the initial seemingly neutral or inquisitive sentiment transitions to a more mocking and ironic sentiment by the end, suggesting a sarcastic undertone. the use of ""i'm sure i'm not entirely correct"", along with ""maybe you should too"" implies that both the speaker and the reader may not fully understand the topic, delivered in a sarcastic manner.

therefore, the final label for the given text is:
### label: sarcastic",1

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        First, I didn't say everyone in the world was religious, I said everyone in the world believed in A god. Second, the majority of the world believes there is a god, and the others don't want to believe (hope there isn't) a god and/or they believe they themselves are the only god of their body.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- **keywords/phrases:** ""everyone in the world"", ""believes in a god"", ""majority of the world"", ""others don't want to believe""
- **sentimental phrases:** ""hope there isn't"", ""believe they themselves are the only god""
- **surface sentiment:** somewhat assertive, possibly defensive or confrontational.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""everyone"" and ""majority"" could hint at a generalization, and there might be a subtle implication of disbelief or opposition towards those who don't believe in a god.
- **language style:** argumentative, defending a viewpoint about religious belief.
- **true intention:** to emphasize the speaker's perspective on the prevalence of belief in god and to challenge contrary views.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** there is a noticeable degree of assertiveness and potential confrontation in the text. there might be a hint of sarcasm in the phrasing about those who ""hope there isn't"" a god and ""they themselves are the only god.""
- **final inference:** the text likely contains sarcasm, as the wording implicitly criticizes and possibly undermines the sincerity of non-believers.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the keywords and phrases include ""thanks,"" ""how delightful,"" ""solid gesture,"" ""intellectual integrity,"" ""creationist camp,"" ""poor argument,"" ""cringed,"" and ""loses ground for the faith.""
- these phrases suggest a tone that fluctuates between polite gratitude and critical observation. however, terms like ""how delightful"" and ""solid gesture"" in the context provided suggest exaggeration.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence is laden with rhetorical devices like exaggeration and irony. the phrase ""how delightful"" in this context suggests the opposite sentiment, expressing disdain or mockery rather than genuine delight.
- the mention of ""resident out-of-the-closet evolutionists"" and the critical tone towards the creationist arguments indicate that the speaker is not genuinely appreciative.
- the statement is laced with irony, especially in the way it criticizes poor argumentation while externally appearing to appreciate the link.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and the true intention are in conflict. the initial surface sentiment of politeness and appreciation transforms upon closer inspection into a clear use of sarcasm.
- the exaggerated gratitude and the critical undertones suggest that the speaker is using irony to mock the creationist arguments and their proponents.
- given the disparity between the surface sentiment and true intention, the sentence is highly sarcastic.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

   - **language style:** the style hints at being dismissive or mocking the situation rather than being genuinely pleased or interested.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment indicates a casual tone, but the true intention shows sarcasm through dismissive remarks and switching to a trivial topic.

- clues: ""not the way i see it from my experiences,"" ""i let the readers decide on their own.""
- the tone appears neutral or slightly defensive.
- no strong sentimental phrases, emojis, or keywords indicating overt emotion (positive or negative).

### step 2: true intention
- ""not the way i see it from my experiences"" suggests a disagreement or an alternative viewpoint.
- ""i let the readers decide on their own"" could imply a dismissal of responsibility or a passive-aggressive way of saying, ""i'm right, but you figure it out yourself.""
- potential for subtle sarcasm based on the context; however, there is no emphatic language or clear rhetorical devices to definitively confirm sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral to slightly defensive.
- the true intention may have a hint of dismissiveness, but it is not overtly sarcastic.
- no strong evidence to shift the surface neutral tone into a clearly sarcastic one.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **tone:** the tone seems authoritative yet absurd in parts, especially with statements like ""i created you"", and the offer of taking someone to the ""upper world"" for a fee.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text is laden with seemingly grandiose claims such as divine creation, combined with absurdities like converting the world in a week and a monetary offer for spiritual ascension.
- **language style:** the language used signifies satire. the idea of paying $100 for a spiritual favor juxtaposed with grand claims highlights the absurdity, indicating a mocking tone.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows an authoritative-seeming text but the escalating absurdity (conversion of world in a week, $100 payment to ascend) points towards sarcasm.
- the true intention is mocking the idea of self-proclaimed prophets or religious frauds who make exaggerated claims for conversion and money.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text is neutral and analytical. it discusses ideas and asks a thought-provoking question without emotional or exaggerated language. there are no keywords that suggest mocking, sneering, or irony.

**step 2: true intention**

- the text exhibits frustration and confrontational tone. words and phrases like “by the way,” “now you cite non-opposites!” and “why do you keep refuting previous arguments?” indicate a defensive and contentious sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the speaker is highlighting the perceived inconsistency in the other person's arguments. the use of phrases like ""by the way,"" and the divided punctuation structure suggest an accusatory tone, with slight exaggeration to emphasize the perceived errors or contradictions in the opposing argument. such rhetorical devices often point to sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

Steps:

- **keywords/phrases:** ""easily spend $1,000 dollars an hour"", ""plenty of reason to live to be 114"".
- **sentimental phrases:** the language appears wistful and hyperbolic with suggestions of extreme spending and longevity.
- **surface sentiment:** slightly whimsical and exaggerated.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of hyperbole (exaggeration) suggests a level of implausibility that is common in sarcastic statements. the phrase ""plenty of reason to live to be 114"" also hints at an unrealistic scenario, which might imply that the speaker is not being serious.
- **language style:** the style suggests a sort of mock seriousness or irony as the statements are highly exaggerated and not practical.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is whimsical and exaggerated, while the true intention, given the hyperbolic nature and unlikely scenarios, aligns more with expressing a sarcastic tone.
- **final inference:** since the exaggerated and unrealistic nature of the statements indicate sarcasm, the final label is determined to be **sarcastic**.

Input:
i'd agree..... faith is a ""leap in the dark"" (or whatever similar phrase we care to use) on at least some level, there is always an element of the intangible there. i know christians who have described their faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ","### step 1:
what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?

- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral. the text outlines different preferences regarding pregnancy in a straightforward manner without emotional indicators or obviously sentimental phrases. the phrase ""simple as that"" could hint at a dismissive or conclusive tone.

### step 2:
deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

- the true intention seems to be emphasizing that an individual's feelings towards pregnancy are their own personal preference and should be respected. the repetition and the finality of ""simple as that"" suggest a possible underlying frustration or the intention to shut down further argument.

### step 3:
compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

- while the surface sentiment is neutral, the true intention may contain a hint of frustration, likely from contributing to a larger debate. the phrase ""simple as that"" in context with a charged topic like pregnancy can imply a sarcastic tone, suggesting that the speaker finds the subject needlessly argued.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text is neutral and analytical. it discusses ideas and asks a thought-provoking question without emotional or exaggerated language. there are no keywords that suggest mocking, sneering, or irony.

**step 2: true intention**

   - **surface sentiment:** critical and possibly mocking.

### step 2: true intention deduction
   - **rhetorical devices:** use of the word ""obviously"" can be a sign of sarcasm, implying that what follows is not obvious at all. the phrase ""up to the darwinists to identify"" can imply a challenge that the speaker believes darwinists may not be able to meet. ""further destroyed"" suggests a strong criticism of darwinist theory.
   - **language style:** the language is dismissive and challenges the credibility of darwinist theory, likely intending to mock or criticize.
   - **true intention:** to mock or criticize darwinians and their theory by suggesting that their failure to identify intelligence would lead to the destruction of their theory.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
   - **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment of critical and possibly mocking aligns with the true intention of mocking or criticizing darwinists. the use of rhetorical devices like ""obviously"" strongly suggests sarcasm.

- **surface sentiment:** critical and analytical.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of phrases like ""government cannot even"" and comparisons to ""alcohol prohibition"" suggests a critical viewpoint and potential sarcasm. the passage is structured to emphasize a perceived failure of government policies through a seemingly factual comparison.
- **language style:** argumentative and critical, pointing out the inefficacy of governmental actions in controlling drug volume and social acceptance while highlighting unintended consequences.
- **true intention:** to criticize and undermine the government's role and effectiveness in controlling drug use and its associated social impacts.

- these words and phrases give off a tone of logical argumentation and philosophical pondering.
- there are no sentimental phrases or emojis suggesting exaggeration, irony, or humor.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence is addressing a debate or discussion about philosophical or logical concepts. the speaker denies making a certain claim and questions the basis for deriving probability and certainty about experiences.
- the tone, while slightly dismissive of certain points, is still rooted more in a logical and argumentative space rather than emotional mockery.
- there doesn’t appear to be significant use of rhetorical devices like irony or heavy sarcasm but there is a hint that the speaker might consider the opposing argument as flawed, especially in the last phrase ""hardly logical proof.""

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention as both are conveying an argumentative and logical stance rather than emotionally charged or mocking.
- even though the final sentence, ""hardly logical proof,"" may sound dismissive, it doesn't carry the exaggerated disbelief or irony typically present in sarcasm.

- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a sincere expression of agreement and understanding. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be negative. keywords and phrases such as ""not sure,"" ""no one is glad,"" and ""died so young"" convey a somber and possibly critical tone. additionally, the phrase ""not even creationists are likely to be gleeful"" seems to express a dismissive or disapproving sentiment.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence seems to be skepticism and criticism of the comment's ability to spark meaningful discussion. the use of phrases that moderate a negative point, like ""not even creationists are likely to be gleeful,"" implies an undercurrent of sarcasm or dismissal. the language employs a mix of straightforward and mildly rhetorical elements, particularly in stating an improbable scenario (""not even creationists"").

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment of negativity and the true intention of skepticism and mild ridicule align well with a sarcastic undertone. the use of phrases that subtly criticize or express improbability suggests that the intention behind the statement is not straightforward but rather ironic.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

### reasoning:
- **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the tone appears to be factual, detailing the steps required to legally obtain a machine gun.
   - keywords like ""actually surprised"" and ""sign your life away"" hint at a deeper sentiment.
   
- **step 2: true intention**
   - the use of phrases like ""sign your life away"" and the detailed legal requirements add a level of exaggeration that suggests the speaker may not be entirely serious.
   - the intention likely includes pointing out the irony or absurdity of the process and its perceived difficulty or risk.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the exaggeration and ironic language used in ""actually surprised"" and ""sign your life away"" suggests the true intention is not merely to inform but to highlight the perceived absurdity.

thus, the text can be labeled as **sarcastic** due to a mismatch between the exaggerated serious tone and the actual intention to mock the process.",1

step 2: true intention - the sentence straightforwardly argues against the notion of free will under divine constraint. the language is literal and lacks the rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **tone:** the tone reads as educated and analytical, with mentions of specific examples and logical replacements in scenarios. 

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the text employs a hypothetical scenario and logical argumentation style. it's not laden with obvious sarcasm or strong rhetorical irony. however, there may be an underlying tone lightly mocking the notion of comparing animal behaviors with human social constructs.
- **language style:** the language is formal and structured, indicating a reasoned argument to support the author's viewpoint about human social dna versus animal behavior.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears informational and argumentative rather than sarcastic.
- the true intention seems to argue a point rather than mock or satirize, though there might be a slight undertone of sarcasm in suggesting animals like chimps performing human activities.

  - the rhetorical questions and references to ""fear of backlash"" and the ""civil war"" serve to underline a perceived inaction and to elevate the seriousness of the matter.
  - the statement ""it's your gig, though, so do what you want"" uses a dismissive tone, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to critique the article's structure for being too verbose and not getting to the point quickly enough. there's an implicit suggestion that the content behind a paywall or the actual content might be better, but the introductory paragraphs are seen as lacking.

### Example:
Input:
false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment has a mix of concern and a slight hint of frustration, indicated by phrases like ""refuse to see"" and ""put us all at risk."" the use of ""touche"" suggests the speaker is acknowledging a point, but potentially with a hint of irony or sarcasm.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention seems to criticize those who refuse to recognize legitimate issues, implying that their ignorance or denial is harmful. the word ""touche,"" typically used to acknowledge a good point in a fencing match, here seems to carry an ironic undertone, suggesting that the speaker is acknowledging a point facetiously.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment shows mild frustration, and the true intention criticizes this refusal in an ironic manner. the use of ""touche,"" in this context, carries an ironic tone which aligns with sarcasm as it acknowledges a point indirectly to highlight the absurdity of the situation.

- the inclusion of the phrase ""i suppose (but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure)"" introduces a slight ambiguity but does not strongly indicate sarcasm.
- the gravity and historical context of the subject matter lean towards a straightforward critique rather than a sarcastic remark.

""but what about the hypothetical?i can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural. so, what i was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture. that's why i brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. i think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the 'logical' brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. but faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and 'make sense' to more than one person, these specific 'explanations' can be passed down. so i don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the text is neutral and analytical. it discusses ideas and asks a thought-provoking question without emotional or exaggerated language. there are no keywords that suggest mocking, sneering, or irony.

**step 2: true intention**
- the language used is straightforward and focused on explaining a concept regarding faith and the nature vs. nurture debate. the speaker does not use any rhetorical devices typical of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or contradiction.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align as neutral and sincere. there is no deviation suggesting a hidden or contradictory meaning which is typical in sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.

   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention align closely, presenting a straightforward, factual argument.
   - **final inference:** given the alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention, the final sarcasm label for this text is firmly **not sarcastic**.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""this doesn't answer my question"", ""if you have 10 doctors for 100 people"", ""health care per capita"", ""per capita expenditures"".
- **sentimental phrases:** ""well then this doesn't answer my question.""
- **surface sentiment:** the surface sentiment appears to be one of frustration or dissatisfaction due to the phrase ""this doesn't answer my question,"" combined with a detailed explanation of a calculation.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** the initial phrase ""well then this doesn't answer my question"" could indicate possible sarcasm. the rest of the text is a detailed, logical explanation which suggests an effort to clarify or emphasize a point.
- **language style:** the language is analytical and explanatory but begins with a phrase that could be read as dismissive or incredulous.
- **true intention:** the true intention seems to be to point out a misunderstanding or frustration with the previous explanation, potentially with a touch of sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment shows frustration and a desire for clarity. the true intention, while providing detailed information, carries an undertone of sarcasm with the initial phrase implying that the previous answer was unsatisfactory.

- clues: ""scumbag democrat,"" ""screeching hate speech,"" ""get real baby,"" ""donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.""
- sentimental phrases indicate a negative and offensive tone.
- the use of strong, disparaging language suggests a high level of anger or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker expresses a clear and genuine disbelief in the validity of what they perceive as ""hate speech"" by a ""scumbag democrat.""
- the rhetorical devices like hyperbole (“donated a vital organ associated with reasoning”) emphasize the speaker's strong rejection of the statement's credibility.
- no indirect criticism, exaggeration beyond belief, or apparent praise to imply the opposite meaning.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment (step 1) is strongly negative and straightforward.
- true intention (step 2) matches the surface sentiment by explicitly indicating anger and disbelief.
- no contradiction or hidden praise that would be indicative of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- the use of ""very true."" at the beginning might give a hint of sarcasm given the context of disagreement, but it is not overtly indicating strong emotion or sarcasm on its own.

### step 2: true intention

  - the phrase ""very true."" could be interpreted as a polite affirmation, setting the stage for the subsequent logical argument.
  - the intention seems to be to engage in a genuine philosophical debate and to present a counter-argument in a rational manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the tone is critical and dismissive, suggesting that the speaker finds the group's actions to be insincere or hypocritical.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

the clues such as ""well for what it's worth"" and ""hope that helped"" often indicate sarcasm. the true intention is likely to criticize or mock the police's use of heavy weaponry for no-knock warrants and the impracticality of certain firearms for home defense, rather than sincerely providing helpful advice. the juxtaposition of the serious subject matter with a seemingly helpful tone also serves to highlight the irony, further supporting the label of sarcasm.",1

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

### step 2: true intention

- **keywords/phrases:** ""value"", ""woman wants it"", ""early stages"", ""doesn't have sentience"", ""potential and dna"", ""wants and choices"", ""dreams for the future"", ""nothing else gives it value"".
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrases seem to downplay the inherent value of the subject in question (potentially a fetus or early pregnancy), emphasizing that its value is solely based on the woman's perception and choices rather than any intrinsic properties.
- **surface sentiment:** the tone is somewhat reflective and could be perceived as cynical or critical.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of phrases like ""only because of a woman's wants and choices"" and ""nothing else gives it value"" could be seen as rhetorical emphasis, potentially indicating a critique of the viewpoint that the value is extrinsically assigned rather than intrinsic.
- **language style:** the language style includes a mixture of scientific and philosophical ideas, but the framing of the sentences suggests a potential critique of the notion being discussed.
- **true intention:** to critique or question the belief that the value of the subject is only attributed by the woman's perception and choices, implying a deeper or morally charged disagreement.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment and the true intention reveal a strong alignment towards critiquing or questioning the stated viewpoint. this alignment and the rhetorical style indicate a likelihood of sarcasm.

but we certainly have the right to evict such persons. but then, regardless, the embryo is not a person.

### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be somewhat contentious. the phrase ""we certainly have the right"" suggests a strong assertion about rights or authority. the term ""evict"" indicates a forceful action, implying a firm stance. the second sentence, ""the embryo is not a person,"" is a declarative statement that challenges a common ethical or philosophical debate.

#### step 2: true intention
the true intention seems to center around debating the personhood of an embryo. the phrases used imply an argument. ""but we certainly"" suggests an assertion of one's stance, while ""but then, regardless"" indicates a logical transition to counter a potential argument. this indicates a serious, logical discussion rather than a sarcastic remark.

#### step 3: compare sentiment and intention
both the surface sentiment and the true intention of the text suggest a serious and logical assertion about rights and personhood rather than a sarcastic remark or mockery. there is no overtly exaggerated irony, mocking tone, or indirect comment that would typically characterize sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords and phrases include ""overlooks,"" ""ignorant or a liar,"" and ""i say both.""
- these words and phrases imply a tone of criticism, accusation, and disdain.
- phrases in quotes suggest skepticism or disbelief.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence is criticizing someone for allegedly ignoring plate tectonics, calling them either ignorant or a liar, and stating a personal belief that they are both.
- the use of quotes around ""overlooks"" and the strong language (""ignorant,"" ""liar"") suggests a mocking or derisive tone.
- the statement ""some might say both"" and ""i say both"" adds to the mocking tone, indicating the speaker does not believe in a benign error but rather in deliberate ignorance or dishonesty.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment, which is critical and disdainful, aligns with the true intention of mocking or accusing the person in question.
- the use of rhetorical devices such as quotations, strong language, and the progression of statements from possibility to certainty strongly implies sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be neutral to positive. keywords such as ""agree,"" ""reasonable,"" and the absence of negative or mocking emotional indicators support a non-sarcastic tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to express genuine agreement with the notion of faith involving an intangible or uncertain element. the language style is straightforward and lacks rhetorical devices commonly associated with sarcasm, such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated contrast.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

- the surface sentiment appears negative and critical. keywords such as ""ought to,"" ""force,"" ""failed to show,"" and ""unsupported"" indicate a confrontational and critical tone.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention of the sentence is to criticize and challenge the logic behind the argument being addressed. the use of reductio ad absurdum (taking the argument to the extreme) is evident: suggesting that a man should have the right to force an abortion if a woman can choose to have one.
- this language style includes rhetorical devices such as hyperbole (""force the woman to have an abortion"") to highlight perceived flaws in the argument. the phrasing and tone suggest a sarcastic remark intended to show the absurdity of the logic being criticized.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in suggesting a critical and mocking tone. the usage of reductio ad absurdum and the confrontational style support the conclusion that the statement is meant to be sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** no evident use of sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices that would hint at a different meaning from the literal one.
   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**

   - **surface sentiment:** critical and corrective.

### step 2: true intention deduction
   - **rhetorical devices:** implies a contradiction and highlights the mistake through the phrasing ""it really doesn't matter"" and ""you had already stated"". the tone carries an implicit correction in a mildly condescending manner.
   - **language style:** corrective and confrontational, aims to point out and rectify an inconsistency.
   - **true intention:** to criticize and highlight the inconsistency in the specification and definition provided. the tone suggests a level of frustration and condescension.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
   - **surface vs. true intention:** the tone on the surface already carries a critical and corrective sentiment, which aligns with the intention of highlighting a mistake critically.
   - **final inference:** the critical and somewhat condescending tone implies a subtle use of sarcasm to point out the inconsistency.

### step 1: surface sentiment
- the sentence uses a conditional phrase ""unless you interpret it that way.""
- there is no obvious use of sarcasm-indicating keywords or phrases like exaggerations or irony.
- the tone appears to be neutral and somewhat flexible, suggesting interpretation depends on the listener.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence indicates that the account is not meant to be taken literally unless one chooses to interpret it that way.
- there is a possibility of subtle irony here, implying that while the speaker says it's not literal, they might actually be hinting that it could be taken literally under certain conditions.
- no strong sarcastic rhetorical devices are evident.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is neutral and seems to reflect genuine flexibility in interpretation.
- the true intention shows a potential for subtle irony but is not strongly suggestive of sarcasm.

false. this is not a valid definition of atheism. atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). certainly, if i said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", i wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. it's called being reasonable.

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment indicates an informative and factual stance. the speaker is correcting a definition and providing a logical analogy to make their point clearer. keywords like ""not a valid definition,"" ""being reasonable,"" and the overall factual tone suggest a calm and straightforward sentiment.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the speaker's true intention is to inform and correct misinformation about the definition of atheism. the analogy used (about the tiger in the bathroom) is meant to illustrate a point about reasonable beliefs without requiring evidence, not to mock or ridicule.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and the true intention both align with providing a factual correction and logical reasoning without any elements of sarcasm. the language use is straightforward and lacks any exaggerated irony or mocking tone that would signify sarcasm.

### explanation:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment suggests a confrontational and mocking tone. 
- clues:
  - keywords: ""slander,"" ""try to disprove,"" ""i suggest,"" ""confirmed the authenticity,"" and ""emoticonxrolleyes""
  - the use of ""emoticonxrolleyes"" indicates a dismissive attitude, often associated with sarcasm.
  - the phrase ""want to slander them as well"" hints at a mocking suggestion.

**step 2: true intention**
- the speaker's true intention appears to be to ridicule the person they are addressing by sarcastically questioning their credibility and intentions.
- the rhetorical question ""want to slander them as well"" is a sarcastic provocation.
- the suggestion to ""disprove their story based on its content"" followed by the recommendation to ""slander"" instead indicates a mocking tone about the likelihood of discrediting the story.
- mentioning the university's confirmation with a dismissive attitude reinforces the sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment and the true intention both indicate a sarcastic and mocking tone.
- the elements of exaggerated irony and dismissive language strongly suggest sarcasm. 

thus, the final label is **sarcastic**.",1

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the text uses strong language and specific phrases such as ""crackpot 'raw food' dietary schemes"" and ""destructive 'lamarckian evolution'"". the use of quotation marks suggests a mocking or dismissive tone. keywords like ""crackpot"" also indicate a negative and sarcastic sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- the true intention behind the statement appears to be dismissive and critical of the idea that doctors would recommend raw food diets based on what the speaker considers a flawed experiment. the language choice and the use of quotation marks imply ridicule and sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment suggests a mocking and critical tone, and this aligns with the true intention which is dismissive and ridiculing the idea presented. the use of strong derogatory terms and implied disbelief contributes to the sarcastic nature of the statement.

- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""interesting to note"" introduces a mild intrigue. 
- **emojis:** none present.
- **sentiment:** the text seems factual but shows some slight sarcasm or skepticism in the phrase ""interesting to note"" juxtaposed with ""cannot seem to agree.""

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **language style:** somewhat formal, trying to be objective but hints at skepticism or criticism through the words ""cannot seem to agree"" and by setting up a contrast between two opinions.
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement uses comparison and contrast to highlight discrepancies within a group (creationist computer software developers/programmers). the phrasing ""hypothetically"" and stark contrast between ""up to 30%"" and ""even a single altered bit would destroy"" implies skepticism.
- **true intention:** to highlight the contradictions and perhaps question the validity or practicality of the analogy being discussed.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears mildly sarcastic when noting the disagreement among programmers. the deeper intention aligns with pointing out these discrepancies, possibly questioning the coherence or validity of the arguments presented.
- **inference:** the contrast between the programmers' opinions, coupled with the juxtaposing phrases like ""interesting to note,"" shows skepticism and criticism towards the analogy being discussed.

---

### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**

the surface sentiment of the input text conveys a highly critical and disdainful attitude towards mormonism and its practices in public schools in utah. the following keywords and phrases indicate this sentiment:
- ""apparently not.""
- ""a whole other book of incredibly stupid poop""
- ""these mormons are as lost a people as you will ever find""
- ""totally immersed in a cult fantasy world.""

the mention of a ""building on the grounds called the seminary"" and the teaching of ""the book of mormon"" in a factual manner serves as the setup for the heavily biased and negative opinions.

**step 2: true intention**

the true intention is to criticize and ridicule the belief system of mormonism and its integration into public school education in utah. the use of hyperbolic language and derogatory terms like ""incredibly stupid poop"" and ""cult fantasy world"" are meant to demean and mock adherents of mormonism. the phrase ""apparently not"" at the beginning adds an ironic twist, implying that the existence of such classes is absurd or unreasonable.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

both the surface sentiment and the true intention are aligned in expressing a mocking and derisive viewpoint towards mormonism. the use of exaggerated negative language and the presence of irony at the start of the sentence strongly indicate sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment – the statement seems positive with phrases such as ""it doesn't look like the uk has been doing too bad"" and ""crime has actually been decreasing."" however, the exaggerated ""it doesn't look like"" and the context can hint at skepticism.

step 2: true intention – the sentence likely questions the validity of the crime statistics or reports. the use of ""doesn't look like"" and ""actually"" implies that the speaker may find the claims of decreasing crime rates hard to believe or contrary to their expectations or observations.

step 3: comparison and analysis – the initial positive surface sentiment contrasts with an underlying skepticism. this discrepancy between the surface sentiment and true intention signals sarcastic undertones.

        ### Input:
        Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by ""higher"" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### Example:
Input:
""so what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body. what is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. the genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc. the body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the dna sequence.""

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   - **keywords/phrases:** ""genes"", ""blueprint for the body"", ""arrangement of cells"", ""influenced by the dna sequence"".
   - **sentimental phrases:** descriptive and factual statements without any apparent emotional extreme.
   - **surface sentiment:** neutral to informative.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   - **rhetorical devices:** no evident use of sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, or other rhetorical devices that would hint at a different meaning from the literal one.
   - **language style:** expository and scientific, aiming to correct a misconception by laying out factual information.
   - **true intention:** to clarify and inform about the role of genes in the body’s development.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true intention:** both the surface sentiment and the true intention align closely, presenting a straightforward, factual argument.
   - **final inference:** given the alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention, the final sarcasm label for this text is firmly **not sarcastic**.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""standards of proof"", ""hold the bible to"", ""religious or fantastical texts"", ""word of god"".
- **sentimental phrases:** ""definitely, without fail"".
- **surface sentiment:** questioning and somewhat doubtful tone; hints of skepticism.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices:** possible use of sarcasm with phrases like ""yes, this one is definitely, without fail, the word of god"".
- **language style:** the question seems to challenge the credibility of holding the bible to a different standard compared to other religious or fantastical texts.
- **true intention:** to question or critique the standards used to validate the bible over other similar texts, potentially implying that the basis for such a distinction is flawed.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment of questioning and skepticism aligns with the potential underlying critique implied by the text. this critique suggests a sarcastic tone, as the phrasing appears to mock the certainty with which one might declare the bible the definitive word of god.

  - ""why don't you just sum it up with...""
  - ""you also fail to consider...""

  - the intention appears to be informative and corrective, rather than mocking or ironically contradicting a perceived stupidity or misunderstanding.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment reflects a critical assessment or an attempt to correct a perceived oversight.
  - the true intention matches this assessment without any underlying irony or sarcasm.
- **inference:**
  - given the direct nature of the critique and the absence of exaggerated or ironic signals, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- this juxtaposition could imply a sarcastic undertone, as if the emotional descriptions are being mocked or are intended to seem overly dramatic.

        ","step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- the surface sentiment appears to be serious and potentially advocating for an ethical standpoint. keywords such as ""protected,"" ""harassed,"" ""assaulted,"" ""murdered,"" ""religion,"" and the repeated assertion ""because they are people"" suggest a concern for human rights and equality.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the true intention seems to be a genuine expression of an ethical argument that protections should be based on human status rather than religious affiliation. the repetition of ""because they are people"" emphasizes this point, and there are no indicators of irony, hyperbole, or exaggerated contrast that would suggest sarcasm.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention align in advocating for human rights and equality based on one's status as a person rather than religious affiliation. there is no indication of mockery, irony, or insincerity.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""so what?"" appears dismissive and suggests a downplaying of the issue at hand.
- the follow-up question ""why should the woman be forced to care for this child against her will?"" sounds serious and inquiring. however, when combined with ""so what?"", it can imply a rhetorical device.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention seems to be questioning the justification of forcing a woman to care for a child against her will. the phrase ""so what?"" can be seen as diminishing the importance of any reason provided, highlighting the perceived absurdity of such a justification.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the contrast between ""so what?"" and the serious follow-up question suggests that the speaker is employing sarcasm to critique or mock the idea of forcing the woman to care for the child. this sarcastic tone is used to emphasize the argument's perceived flaws.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""but...but..."", ""indigestion for nothin'"", ""don't care"", and ""credit card offers"" are laden with irony, humor, or exaggeration.
- **tone:** superficially, the tone appears exaggerated and absurd, using humor and hyperbole to communicate.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the text uses hyperbole (exaggerating the swallowing of zygotes) and sarcastic trademarks like ""ripofflican(tm) party"" to make a point about electoral processes and consumerism.
- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.
- however, it's crucial to validate the text against sarcasm signs like implied meaning opposite to the surface meaning. in this case, although humorous and exaggerated, the absurdity serves more as a rhetorical device to mock rather than authentic sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases:** ""but does anyone actually need"" and ""are there any laws stating one must"" suggest a questioning tone.
- **emojis:** none present.

- **language style:** the style shows clear signs of sarcasm through absurdity and over-the-top statements meant to mock or criticize.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment reads as humorous and sarcastic, but the true intention is aligned with a critique carried out through these rhetorical devices.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** phrases like ""if more gun-control saves lives"", and ""aren't you pro-gunners interested in freedom?"" suggest a surface sentiment of debate or argumentation.
- **tone:** on the surface, the text seems to question the pro-gun stance using arguments about freedom and life, suggesting a serious tone regarding gun control and freedom.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the question ""aren't you pro-gunners interested in freedom?"" is a rhetorical question. there is an implied tone of irony or sarcasm that suggests the author does not believe that pro-gunners are truly interested in freedom.
- **language style:** the style of the text uses logical reasoning to present an ostensibly serious argument but ends with a rhetorical question that implies criticism of pro-gun individuals.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears to be serious and argumentative, discussing the relationship between gun control and freedom.
- the true intention, however, uses irony and rhetorical questioning to imply that pro-gun advocates are hypocritical or misguided in their understanding of freedom.
- the final statement, ""aren't you pro-gunners interested in freedom?"", strongly indicates sarcasm. the question suggests an opinion counter to the argument it appears to support at face value, a hallmark of a sarcastic statement.

- the statement appears confrontational and dismissive, containing phrases such as ""well you think wrong,"" ""the game is over,"" and ""you lost.""
- the tone suggests a dismissive attitude towards the initial position.
- there is an implication of superiority from the speaker.

step 2: true intention
- the sentence intends to criticize and discredit the argument of the opposing party, expressing a finality in the debate (i.e., “the game is over,” “you lost”).
- the use of “well you think wrong” is not just an argument but a put-down, which is often found in sarcastic remarks.
- the language is sharp and confrontational, reflecting a sense of scorn or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the dismissive and superior tone in the surface sentiment aligns with the rhetorical devices (i.e., put-downs and finality) that imply sarcasm.
- the true intention of belittling the opponent’s argument confirms the use of sarcasm, especially through the phrasing designed to undermine and ridicule.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""oh my goodness"", ""a trick called semantics"", ""i guess you got sucked in"", ""yes, abortion is used as contraception unfortunately"".
- **sentimental phrases**: ""oh my goodness"" can indicate surprise or disbelief, ""i guess you got sucked in"" suggests a sense of mocking or condescension.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""oh my goodness"" and ""i guess you got sucked in"" suggests that the speaker is not genuinely concerned or surprised but is instead mocking the situation or the person they're addressing.
- **language style**: the phrase ""a trick called semantics"" implies a dismissive attitude towards the argument being made. ""yes, abortion is used as contraception unfortunately"" adds a tone of indignation or disapproval, but in the context of the prior mocking statements, it adds to the sarcastic undertone.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker appears to be sarcastically dismissing the argument as mere wordplay (""a trick called semantics"") and mocking the other person for supposedly falling for it (""i guess you got sucked in"").

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment appears to be disbelief and condescension. the true intention, revealed through the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the other person's argument by implying they have been fooled by semantics.

Input:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","i will perform a step-by-step analysis to ensure the confidence in my judgment.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the provided statement contains phrases such as ""i think it's a good idea"" which appears neutral or positive on the surface. however, the following statement ""maybe you can't, but i guess that's your problem"" suggests a dismissive and confrontational tone, potentially indicating frustration or mocking.

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention appears to be ridiculing or dismissing the other person's capabilities or concerns (""maybe you can't, but i guess that's your problem""). the capitalization of ""you"" emphasizes singling out the individual, increasing the probability of sarcasm. the phrase ""i guess that's your problem"" implies a lack of sympathy and indifference, often indicative of sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
there is a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment of ""i think it's a good idea"" and the dismissive attitude revealed in the follow-up statement. the rhetorical device used suggests that the initial positive sentiment was not genuine but meant to mock the other individual.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""try and comprehend this child,"" and ""in your mind does it prove anything"" contribute to a demeaning tone.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement contains elements of frustration and the use of commands to dictate discussion boundaries. phrases like ""lets concentrate like a laser beam"" and ""start your own thread"" show a strong, directive tone. the use of multiple periods and the word ""thanks"" at the end feels dismissive rather than polite.

### step 2: true intention
upon analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, the speaker is not genuinely conveying gratitude or encouragement. instead, the use of ""lets concentrate like a laser beam"" and ""thanks"" with multiple periods suggests an underlying condescension. this tone, combined with the directive to ""if you want to talk about gay bashing start your own thread,"" implies frustration or annoyance with a sense of ridiculing the appropriateness of the initial discussion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (which sounds guiding or directive) and the true intention (which is dismissive and sarcastic). the exaggerated politeness and the directive nature of the comments suggest sarcasm.

surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

the sentence uses a rhetorical comparison between cancer cells and liberals, implying that liberals are harmful to society in the same way that cancer cells are harmful to the body. the dismissive ""huh... go figure"" at the end suggests the speaker finds this comparison obvious or ironic, hinting at an underlying sarcastic tone.

""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
* **clues:** the phrase ""one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble"" uses extreme and dismissive language. ""puppy dribble"" is condescending and dismissive, and ""manufactured"" suggests artificiality.
* **sentiments:** the statement appears negative and dismissive of whatever is being described.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the exaggerated phrasing (""one of the biggest"") and the use of derogatory terms (""sentimental puppy dribble"", ""manufactured"") hint that the speaker is ridiculing the subject.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is not genuinely stating that the object has sentimental value; rather, they are mocking it for being overly sentimental and insincere.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment with the true meaning reveals that the speaker is clearly not expressing a genuine opinion but is instead mocking and sarcastic about the subject.

- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""the difference is some of us know that most people have or will and that it does not make us a fount of knowledge"" suggests a distinction being made, implying that not realizing this might mean one is not as knowledgeable as they think. the final phrase ""as you show us so well"" is likely sarcastic, implying the opposite of what it says.
- **context analysis:** the entire text seems to point towards a critique masked as a general statement, with the final sentence likely being a mocking comment.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment could seem conversational or even complimentary. however, the rhetorical device used—irony, especially in the final statement—indicates that the actual intention is to criticize or mock.

""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.

- **sentimental phrases**: phrases like ""you said there wasn't"" and ""i would have to do my research"" suggest an underlying tone of disbelief or correction.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the message uses irony and possibly sarcasm. the statement ""i would have to do my research to dig up a group in 1850"" is likely not a genuine expression of doubt but rather a pointed way of suggesting that the claim about no pro-choice groups before roe v wade is absurd.
- **language style**: the style is dismissive and possibly mocking, indicating that the speaker is ironically undermining the validity of the initial claim.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment of skepticism and confrontation aligns with an underlying ironic mockery. the speaker is not genuinely considering doing research but highlighting the ridiculousness of the original claim.
- **inference**: the mismatch between pretending to do serious research and the absurdity of finding such groups in 1850 points toward sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the surface sentiment seems to be enthusiastic and excited. the use of ""woo hoo"" and ""wee ha"" conveys a sense of joy or celebration. the phrases ""all the more reason to see it"" and ""the cats meow"" suggest positive reinforcement of the film.

### step 2: true intention
upon further analysis, the language indicates a different underlying intention. the mention of ""the main stream entertainment industry who brought us such great talent as brittney spears"" is likely meant to be ironic or dismissive, as britney spears has often been a controversial figure in terms of talent. the over-the-top exclamations like ""woo hoo"" and ""wee ha"" further suggest that the excitement may not be genuine but instead mocking.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the comparison between the surface sentiment (which appears enthusiastic) and the true intention (which seems to be sarcastic) reveals a mismatch. the exaggerated manner and ironic references indicate that the speaker is likely using sarcasm to criticize the mainstream entertainment industry's tastes and judgments about the film.

- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""people who don't get their boilers serviced regularly"" (appears neutral), "":)"" (indicates positivity).
- the sentence appears to convey a light-hearted tone due to the smiley emoticon.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **generalization**: ""people who don't get their boilers serviced regularly"" could be a general remark on a specific group.
  - **emoticon :)**: this emoticon typically signifies happiness or friendliness but can also indicate sarcasm depending on the context.
- **deduction**: the inclusion of the smiley emoticon at the end of a seemingly neutral statement about people's habits suggests that the speaker is not genuinely positive but might be making a sarcastic comment about the inadequacy of those people.

### step 3: comparison & analysis
- the surface sentiment appears neutral or ambiguously positive.
- the true intention, given the context and the usage of a smiley emoticon, seems to be highlighting a critical or mocking viewpoint.
- this difference suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""pulling our legs,"" ""simply not true,"" ""truer words were never spoken.""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

- **language style:** the progression of statements leads to a critical deconstruction of the arguments, employing skepticism and irony to counter positions against evolution.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention both display significant elements of disbelief and irony.
- the keywords and phrases exhibit typical sarcastic language.

the surface sentiment appears to be negative and hostile due to the suggestion of sending someone to be beheaded and the use of ""hoho,"" which is often used in a mocking or sneering manner.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the text makes an exaggerated and extreme suggestion (""we don't really have to elect him to any post...just send him over there"" and ""hopefully, he would be beheaded by nightfall on the first day""), which is highly unlikely to be a serious proposal. this use of exaggeration and extreme language indicates that the speaker is not genuinely advocating for the suggested actions but is instead using hyperbole and sarcasm to mock someone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment seems reflective, appearing to contemplate the nature of god and suffering seriously. however, the true intention reveals an ironic critique of the belief that god controls everything to prevent bad things, suggesting the opposite is true.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

        You're deluded, as usual. Anything that doesn't balance the budget is based on LIBERAL THINKING. And you don't balance the budget with massive tax hikes and gutting the military like the liberals are fond of doing. And you're going to vote for liberals? Obama? His latest budget plan was defeated 414-0 in the House. Not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it. And you vote for Obama? What the hell is the matter with you people?

- **keywords and phrases**: ""you're deluded, as usual"", ""liberal thinking"", ""massive tax hikes"", ""gutting the military"", ""vote for liberals"", ""obama"", ""not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it"", ""what the hell is the matter with you people?""
- **emojis/emoticons**: none used.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs direct insults (""you're deluded, as usual""), repetition for emphasis (""vote for obama?""), rhetorical questions (""what the hell is the matter with you people?""), and selectively highlighting negative attributes associated with liberals.
- **language style**: the language is confrontational, derogatory, and heavily opinionated, aimed at discrediting the opposing viewpoint.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is criticizing and mocking the opposing political viewpoint and the act of voting for liberals, particularly obama. the tone suggests that the speaker believes liberals are completely misguided in their policies and that the listener is equally misguided for supporting them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is overtly negative and confrontational. the use of direct insults and rhetorical questions further emphasizes the intention of derision and mockery. the true intention aligns with the surface sentiment, indicating that the speaker is mocking and discrediting opposing political beliefs in a sarcastic manner.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

(laughing out loud, which often indicates sarcasm in this context).

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs strong judgmental language and religious condemnation (""sinful, illicit gay-sex sodomy,"" ""perversion,"" ""right in step with satan""). the inclusion of ""you can really feel proud of that"" and ""lol!"" reveals a clear use of sarcasm.
- **language style**: highly charged language aiming to ridicule and mock the individual.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker disapproves of the actions of the person being addressed. the comment about being ""right in step with satan"" and feeling ""proud"" is meant to sarcastically highlight the speaker's disapproval and mock the recipient's stance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is heavily judgmental and scornful, highlighted by words like ""sinful"" and ""perversion"" as well as ""lol"" at the end. the true intention is to mock and discredit the person for their actions and beliefs, using sarcasm to emphasize their disdain.

### Example:
Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

- sentimental phrases: ""better luck next time,"" usually implies a form of encouragement.
- emojis: ""emoticonxconfused"" suggests confusion, and ""emoticonxgood"" suggests a positive or supportive sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the statement employs dismissive language (""i guess we all missed your point,"" ""whatever it might have been"") and sarcasm in ""better luck next time.""
- language style: the statement is sarcastic. the initial confusion paired with ""better luck next time"" implies that justine's point was either nonsensical or poorly communicated, hence the sarcasm.

the surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and cynical. the phrases ""must be,"" ""mightily proselytizing away,"" and ""they might make a billion yet"" suggest a dismissive or mocking tone.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the usage of ""must be"" indicates a forced certainty, implying the speaker does not really believe it. the phrase ""mightily proselytizing away"" exaggerates the effort of converting others, and ""they might make a billion yet"" seems to mock the idea that mormons could achieve a huge number of converts. these elements together suggest the speaker is mocking the idea that islam and roman catholicism will dominate in the final days while also implying mormons are trying excessively hard to gain converts.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the skepticism, cynicism, exaggeration, and mocking tone indicate the speaker is being sarcastic.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

### step 2:
the statement uses exaggerated generalizations (""they have no use for logic, common sense"") and rhetorical devices that imply disbelief and criticism. the mention of the debate ""going to go around in circles"" emphasizes a negative view of the rationality of one side of the debate. the caution about proving ""bell right"" appears to be an ironic comment suggesting that any sensible points made will ironically support an otherwise ridiculed position.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

### response:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the statement superficially appears to make a positive comment, referring to someone as ""comic relief"" and suggesting they will ""always be young mentally."" phrases like ""you'll never have that problem"" and ""always be young mentally"" might initially appear complimentary.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - analyzing the language style, calling someone ""comic relief"" rather than addressing them more seriously can be dismissive or mocking. likewise, ""always be young mentally"" implies a permanent lack of maturity rather than actual youthful thinking. the intention seems to be indirectly criticizing or mocking the person's perceived immaturity or triviality.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - there is a significant disparity between the surface sentiment (which seems positive or reassuring) and the true intention (which is derogatory and ridiculing). the positive-sounding words are used sarcastically to imply a negative judgment on the person's mental maturity.

   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **clues:** the phrase ""click on the link...... center for the working poor"" presents an invitation for something that initially seems important or substantial. the follow-up ""which is tada!!!! the burning bush!!!!"" features an exaggerated and enthusiastic exclamation.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of ""tada!!!!"" along with excessive exclamation marks indicates a sense of showmanship or surprise that contrasts sharply with the serious connotation of ""center for the working poor."" the phrase ""the burning bush"" being announced in such an exaggerated manner suggests a mismatch in tone relative to the serious subject.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is likely using hyperbolic enthusiasm to highlight a perceived absurdity or an unexpected twist, indicating that the visit to ""the burning bush"" might be seen as trivial or superficial in comparison to what ""center for the working poor"" might suggest.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment, which includes exaggerated enthusiasm, with the true intention, which seems to be pointing out a perceived absurdity, it becomes clear that the speaker is using irony.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.

- overall sentiment: this surface reading appears to be presenting a situation factually, but the phrasing suggests some underlying criticism.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: there is clear sarcasm in the use of ""meet the prerequisite of being the proper gender for them."" this phrase undermines the concept of being liked purely for personality by sarcastically emphasizing a rigid condition.
- language style: the initial ""yeah,"" sets a casual tone, which is often used in sarcastic remarks. the use of ""prerequisite"" turns the statement into one that mocks the overly simplistic view of relationships.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: though the statement appears to be assessing a condition objectively, the tone and phrasing indicate a sarcasm suggesting that the simplistic expectation of being liked for personality is impractical or naive.
- inference: the true intention is not to state a genuine fact about relationships but to mock the ideal of personality being the sole factor, emphasizing the importance of gender as a prerequisite sarcastically.

    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be skeptical or incredulous, as implied by the rhetorical question ""so i pray to chance every night before i go to bed?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the phrase ""pray to chance"" is an oxymoron, as ""chance"" implies randomness, which one typically wouldn't ""pray"" to. this suggests that the speaker does not actually believe in the value or logic of praying to chance, but rather is mocking the idea.

step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the combination of the rhetorical question and the oxymoronic phrase implies a sarcastic undertone, as the speaker seems to be ridiculing the idea rather than taking it seriously.

"Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""that's not evolution, that's abiogenesis. human memory? how long do you suppose that is? decide? now you're pulling our legs. the rest of the ape family will never evolve into humans. btw we are apes. simply not true. your sources are lying to you. truer words were never spoken. except most people with a scientific background reject the supposed evidence against evolution and for good reason, it doesn't exist.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""pulling our legs,"" ""simply not true,"" ""truer words were never spoken.""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""pulling our legs"" is a clear indicator of disbelief or jest. phrases like ""simply not true"" and ""truer words were never spoken"" are often used sarcastically to contradict the preceding statement.
- **language style:** the progression of statements leads to a critical deconstruction of the arguments, employing skepticism and irony to counter positions against evolution.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention both display significant elements of disbelief and irony.
- the keywords and phrases exhibit typical sarcastic language.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: the phrase ""it has been 33 years"" implies a significant amount of time has passed. comparing this to ""the allies managed to stop the holocaust in only two"" uses a historical event known for its gravity and urgency.
- sentimental phrases: ""dragging your feet"" implies slow or reluctant action. the use of quotes around ""holocaust"" and ""unborn babies"" indicates doubt or disbelief in the seriousness of these terms.
- overall sentiment: the comparison and choice of quotes suggest a critical or mocking tone.

step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses comparison (33 years vs. 2 years) and quotation marks to downplay or belittle the subject (referring to the issue as a ""holocaust"" against ""unborn babies"").
- language style: the directness and use of historical context suggest irony, particularly when calling out the lack of action over an extended period.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not believe that the issue is as serious as it's being portrayed and is using sarcasm to highlight what they see as a disproportionate response.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment is critical. the tone, historical comparison, and use of quotes signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is to mock the perceived inaction by drawing a stark comparison with a universally acknowledged atrocity.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **clues:** the word ""duh!"" indicates obviousness or condescension. the phrase ""maybe the folks who wrote the book of yasher had access to manetho"" implies doubt or skepticism about the claim. the emoticon ""emoticonxrolleyes"" suggests frustration or disdain.
* **sentiments:** the sentence exhibits condescension, skepticism, and disdain.

step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of ""duh!"" and the rolling eyes emoticon point toward sarcasm. the author likely does not believe that the authors of the book of yasher had access to manetho, and this is expressed through a mocking tone.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is likely dismissing or mocking the idea that the authors of the book of yasher had access to manetho.

step 3: comparison and analysis
* comparing the surface sentiment (condescension, mockery) with the true intention (to mock or dismiss the claim) reveals a clear match. the tone and word choices validate that the speaker is not genuinely suggesting a real connection between the book of yasher and manetho.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

"Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like kfc to me.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** the phrase ""that's funny"" combined with ""sure don't taste like kfc to me"" is pivotal.
   * **sentiments:** the sentiment on the surface appears to express amusement but also dissatisfaction or disappointment. the phrase ""sure don't taste like kfc"" highlights a clear disparity between what was expected and what was delivered.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the statement ""that's funny"" is often used sarcastically to imply that something is not actually funny or amusing. the comparison between scrambled eggs and kfc (which is known for its distinct taste, not typically resembling scrambled eggs) is hyperbolic.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely criticizing the quality or taste of the scrambled eggs by sarcastically comparing them to kfc. the true intention is to convey dissatisfaction or disappointment in an ironic manner.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   * the surface sentiment of amusement paired with the dissatisfaction highlighted in the detailed comparison leads to a clear ironic mismatch.
   * the sarcastic ""that's funny"" underscores the mocking undertone.

### Example:
Input:
""i wasn't aware that the candidates were the ones allowed to ask the debate questions. emoticonxconfused""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

- **tone:** the sentence starts with ""good,"" which might suggest agreement or approval, but it quickly pivots to a pointed question.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""what took the creationists so long to catch up?"" implies criticism by suggesting that creationists are slow to recognize well-established scientific principles. the question is rhetorical, implying that there's an obvious delay in creationists' acceptance of darwin's ideas.
- **context analysis:** contextually, the sentence implies that the acceptance of darwin's theory should have happened much sooner. this reflects criticism towards creationists and possibly mocks their reluctance or delay.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment might seem neutral or slightly approving, as indicated by ""good."" however, the true intention is clearly critical and mocking, due to the rhetorical question and implication of lateness.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the statement presents a positive surface sentiment through the phrase ""i agree, it is pure genius"". however, this is followed by a mention of it infiltrating ""politics and governments"" and ending with the emoticon ""emoticonxbanghead"", which indicates frustration or disbelief.

### step 2: true intention
despite the initial positive phrase, ""pure genius"", the content about infiltrating ""politics and governments"" and the frustrated emoticon suggest a negative viewpoint. the use of ""pure genius"" seems ironic, and the emoticon indicates the speaker is actually frustrated or upset with the situation, rather than genuinely admiring it.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a clear contrast between the initial positive phrase and the subsequent negative connotation. the positive phrase ""pure genius"" is likely being used sarcastically to imply that the infiltration of politics and governments is not genuinely genius but rather troubling or problematic.

Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

the real intention is to highlight the absurdity of an unstated assertion or belief, likely one that questions the validity of parents providing for their children. the use of the kkk as an example is meant to exaggerate and ridicule the original idea by showing how it could be warped to include universally condemned groups, thus emphasizing its ridiculousness.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention

- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
* **clues:** the sentence starts with ""as compared to 'truth' (capital t)"" which suggests it addresses a notion often held in high regard. the phrase ""creationist theocrats have this tendency to portray their subjective beliefs as truth"" uses critical language. the term ""wishful thinking as facts"" implies skepticism. the closing ""no surprise there"" adds a dismissive tone.
* **sentiments:** the overall language is critical, skeptical, and dismissive of creationist theocrats.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of quotation marks around ""truth"" and the capital 't' is likely sarcastic, suggesting the author does not believe the subject holds real truth. the term ""creationist theocrats"" has a negative connotation, and ""wishful thinking as facts"" further indicates a mocking tone. the phrase ""no surprise there"" underscores the sarcasm by downplaying any expectation of truth.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is mocking creationist theocrats' claims to truth and highlighting their beliefs as subjective and unfounded.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of being critical and dismissive aligns with the true intention of mocking and skepticism. the sarcastic tone is evident through rhetorical devices, including quotation marks and dismissive remarks.

### Example:

""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **clues:** the phrase ""simply put tq, and try real hard to comprehend this"" implies impatience or condescension. the statement provides clarification in a somewhat definitive manner.
* **sentiments:** the overall tone is direct with an undertone of frustration or condescension, particularly towards the listener's understanding capabilities.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of phrases like ""try real hard to comprehend this"" and ""to remind you of the very clear difference"" suggests a patronizing or condescending tone. it indicates that the speaker feels they are having to reiterate something that should have already been understood.
* **true meaning:** the sentence indicates the speaker's frustration and a sense of superiority, believing that their point should have been obvious and requires re-explanation only due to the listener's lack of comprehension.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear match. the condescension detected at the surface is consistent with the true intention of the sentence: to express frustration and impatience towards the listener's understanding.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement ""the poor in the us certainly seem to eat more than the rich in most countries."" uses words like ""certainly"" to emphasize a point. the language might superficially seem to make an observation about the eating habits of the poor in the us compared to the rich in other countries.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention here becomes clearer when examining the context and the hyperbolic nature of the statement. the speaker aims to highlight the issue of poverty in the us by ironically suggesting that even the poor in the us are better off (in terms of food consumption) than the rich in most other countries. this exaggeration highlights a critical societal issue through irony and hyperbole.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (an observation about food consumption) and the true intention (criticism or observation about poverty and inequality). the exaggerated comparison suggests an ironic tone, indicating sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""news flash"" is often used sarcastically to introduce information that is supposedly obvious or already known. it can be seen as mocking or emphasizing the obviousness of the statement that follows.
- **language style**: the declarative nature of the statement ""being catholic and following christ's teachings are not one in the same"" suggests a contrasting opinion or a clarification. given the context provided by ""news flash"", it has a tone of enlightening or correcting a perceived misunderstanding.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is likely emphasizing an evident or widely accepted distinction between being catholic and actually following christ's teachings, hinting that the two do not necessarily go hand in hand, as someone might incorrectly assume.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment indicated by the use of ""news flash"" combined with the content of the statement suggests a sarcastic tone. the true intention is to point out something the speaker feels should be obvious or already known, and it's presented in a way that mocks those who might conflate the two ideas.

- **context analysis:** the emphasis on historical context and the use of ""too"" suggests that the speaker thinks the reader is ignorant of well-known facts, intending to mock or criticize the reader’s knowledge.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears factual or advisory, but the true intention is dismissive and condescending. this discrepancy reveals a likely sarcastic tone.

"Oh come on. If those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. Canada must have a LOT of tax dollars.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement expresses disbelief and criticism, highlighted by phrases like ""oh come on,"" ""probably millions of people,"" ""canada must have a lot of tax dollars,"" and ""it's downright scary."" the use of quotation marks around ""investigate"" suggests skepticism about the term's appropriateness in the context.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker is not genuinely concerned about the investigation or the normality of the sentiments expressed. instead, they are using exaggeration and rhetorical questions to mock the idea of investigating people for what they consider to be normal sentiments. the mention of ""millions of people"" and ""tax dollars"" serves to humorously overstate the impracticality and absurdity of the governmental action.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a distinct difference between the surface sentiment (concern over governmental actions) and the true intention (ridicule and criticism of the investigation). the exaggerated manner, rhetorical questions, and overall tone suggest sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**

    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**

    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

And down the road abit don't be surprised if you see Sunday Blue Laws being enacted to enforce worship on Sunday! All in the name of giving man a rest from toil of course!,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **sentiments:** the statement seems to predict an event with a tone that can be perceived as cautionary, but the ending phrase ""all in the name of giving man a rest from toil of course!"" introduces a sense of skepticism or disbelief.

### step 2: true intention deduction 
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of ""of course"" as a closing emphasizes the speaker's disbelief and irony. the exclamation marks further highlight their skepticism regarding the genuine intention behind the enactment of blue laws. 
* **true meaning:** the speaker is likely skeptical about the implementation of sunday blue laws and mocks the premise that it would genuinely be for providing rest. the sarcastic tone is suggested by the ironic use of ""of course!"" 

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- overall sentiment: the choice of words and repetition of ""if you actually"" show annoyance and a defensive stance.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: repetition of ""if you actually"" suggests sarcasm as it emphasizes the listener's failure to pay attention.
- language style: the combination of addressing attention and quoting points reflect irritation, likely indicating a sarcastic tone.
- underlying message: the speaker likely feels misunderstood and is expressing that frustration sarcastically.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: while the surface sentiment indicates frustration, the repetition and phrasing point to sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is to mock the listener's lack of attention and misunderstanding.

Because those who are pro life are against a womens right to own her own body. Her body her choice and none of anyone elses business. Remember control freaks are everywhere.,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **clues:** phrases like ""those who are pro life are against a women's right to own her own body"" and ""her body her choice and none of anyone else's business"" are strongly worded and express a clear stance on the issue of women's reproductive rights. additionally, the statement ""remember control freaks are everywhere"" carries a somewhat pejorative tone.

* **rhetorical devices and style:** the statement is straightforward and does not employ exaggerated or ironic language. the points are clearly asserted without the use of irony, exaggeration, or nonchalance that would indicate sarcasm.
* **true meaning:** the speaker genuinely believes and advocates that women's reproductive rights should be respected and that opposition to these rights is unwarranted control over women's bodies.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
* **comparison and analysis:** the surface sentiment and the true intention align well. both indicate a serious and genuine concern about women's rights with a clear condemnation of those opposed to these rights.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment has an air of apology or reluctance at the beginning but quickly moves to a dismissive or resigned tone with phrases like “this has been gone over a hundred times,” “it would be 'nice' to consult the man responsible,” and “blah blah…you know.” words like ""sorry to butt in"" and ""nice"" appear to be used sarcastically here.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""so sorry to butt in,"" ""it would be 'nice',"" and the use of ""blah blah"" suggest the speaker is not genuinely sympathetic or engaged and may be mocking the repetition of a well-known argument.

### step 2: true intention

- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses sarcasm with phrases like “so sorry to butt in” and the use of “nice” in a situation where the speaker clearly feels it’s a moot point. the inclusion of “blah blah” underscores the speaker’s dismissiveness and sarcasm toward the entire argument being discussed.
- **language style**: the style is dismissive and sarcastic, indicating the speaker does not genuinely respect the points being re-iterated and is instead mocking the redundancy of the discussion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears superficially apologetic but carries a dismissive undertone. this is matched by the true intention, which reveals a clear use of sarcasm to mock the redundancy and perceived triviality of the argument.
- **inference**: the repetition and rhetorical style strongly suggest that the sentiment expressed is not genuine, and the speaker is using sarcasm to highlight their disinterest or disdain for the argument being reiterated.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears critical and questioning. the phrase ""including the mentally ill, those with previous violent felonies, and children?"" suggests a critique of a policy or idea that includes these potentially vulnerable or contentious groups.
- **sentimental phrases**: the list of groups mentioned (mentally ill, individuals with violent felonies, and children) carries a loaded connotation, implying that their inclusion is questionable or controversial.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses rhetorical questioning to highlight the absurdity or controversial nature of including these groups in the unspecified context. this questioning tone often indicates sarcasm when the actual intention is to criticize or mock.
- **language style**: the style is concise and pointed, aimed at drawing attention to the potentially alarming or illogical nature of the situation being described.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: while the surface sentiment involves listing groups in a questioning manner, the true intention seems to be to highlight the perceived absurdity or danger of including these groups for whatever context is being discussed. 
- **inference**: the disparity between merely listing the groups and the pointed rhetorical questioning suggests that the speaker finds the idea objectionable, using sarcasm to underline their critique.

""i wasn't aware that the candidates were the ones allowed to ask the debate questions. emoticonxconfused""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""

so, faith and argument from incredulity. 
if you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. then maybe an actual scientist could take over.
major in molecular biology? not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.

### surface sentiment:
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** 
  - ""faith and argument from incredulity"" shows skepticism towards the argument's basis.
  - ""please state exactly what part is impossible"" seems to request a specific explanation.
  - ""maybe an actual scientist could take over"" implies that the current speaker is not competent.

  - ""faith and argument from incredulity"" often used to dismiss non-scientific arguments.
  - ""please state exactly what part is impossible"" and ""maybe an actual scientist could take over"" mock the speaker's understanding and qualifications.
  - ""major in molecular biology? not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original"" uses ridicule to belittle the speaker's credentials and originality.
- **context analysis:**
  - the text is dripping with irony and mockery, suggesting the speaker believes the addressee is not qualified or capable.

### comparison and analysis:
- **surface vs. true intention:** 
  - surface sentiment includes requests for specifics and an implication of incompetence.

And praytell; what evidence do you to tell us where the 17 year old kid got the pistol to begin with?",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
* **clues:** the term ""you're such an idiot"" is a derogatory insult suggesting a negative sentiment. the phrase ""praytell; what evidence do you to tell us where the 17 year old kid got the pistol to begin with?"" seems accusatory and confrontational.
* **sentiments:** the overall sentiment appears negative and critical. 

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the phrase “(chuckle)” indicates a mocking or derisive tone. the structure of the question “praytell; what evidence do you to tell us where the 17 year old kid got the pistol to begin with?” implies that the speaker doubts the other person’s ability to provide a satisfactory answer. the term ""you're such an idiot"" may not be meant literally but intended to mock or belittle the other person's intelligence in a sarcastic manner.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is likely mocking the intelligence of the person they are addressing and suggesting that they don't have a compelling answer.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it is clear that the speaker's negative and mocking language points to a sarcastic tone. the derisive laughter (""(chuckle)"") and the pointed question both aim to belittle the other person in a way that is not straightforward but rather sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

so, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? gimme a break. he supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. in case you haven't noticed, the majority of americans are against gay marriage.

### steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: phrases like ""gimme a break"" indicate frustration or disbelief.
- sentimental phrases: ""in case you haven't noticed"" seems condescending.
- overall sentiment: the statement seems to be challenging an implied argument or assumption with a dismissive tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement employs rhetorical questions and dismissive phrases (""gimme a break""), which suggest ridicule or scorn.
- language style: the sarcasm is especially evident in the rhetorical question and the condescending follow-up statement.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not believe that one needs to be faithful in their own marriage to be against gay marriage, and is attempting to expose the perceived flaw in that line of thinking.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: while the surface sentiment appears to logically critique an argument, the exaggerated disbelief and rhetorical questioning signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention of the speaker is to mock and dismiss the idea that personal faithfulness is a prerequisite for opposing gay marriage.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **emojis/emoticons**: none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses a ridiculous comparison to illustrate an absurdity, implying that believing the fbi has a political agenda is as silly as believing a marketing claim without any critical thinking.
- **language style**: the comparison between trusting an opinion based on a commercial and believing a serious statement about the fbi indicates sarcasm. 
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is mocking the idea that the fbi has a political agenda by comparing it to the simplistic and naive belief in a commercial's claim about taste preferences. this implies that the notion is baseless and should not be taken seriously.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention**: the surface sentiment seems to propose a comparison, but the true intention is to mock and discredit the idea that the fbi has a political agenda, using sarcasm to dismiss the claim.

Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

- **clues**:
  - the phrase ""then why do you go out of your way to make it sound that way?"" suggests a confrontational or interrogative tone.
  - the assertion ""i doubt if you even know what a gun crazy is"" is dismissive and implies a low opinion of the other person's knowledge.
  - the reference to ""the land of oz"" introduces a fantastical, exaggerated element that seems out of place.
  - the phrase ""having a couple of b.b. guns"" trivializes the idea being discussed.

- **sentimental phrases**:
  - ""why do you go out of your way""
  - ""i doubt if you even know""
  - ""land of oz"" (a fantasy reference)
  - ""a couple of b.b. guns"" (trivializing the concept of being 'gun crazy')

- **overall sentiment**:
  - the statement seems dismissive, confrontational, and trivializing. the choice of phrases and the reference to a fantasy land suggest ridicule.

### step 2: true intention:
- **rhetorical devices**:
  - hyperbole: the reference to ""the land of oz"" exaggerates the context to highlight the perceived absurdity.
  - sarcasm: the disbelief that the other person even knows what ""a gun crazy is"" and the downplaying of the subject to imply it's trivial.
  - irony: the whole statement contrasts the exaggerated notion of ""gun crazy"" with something as harmless as b.b. guns, which adds an ironic twist.

- **language style**:
  - the direct and mocking tone, along with exaggerated comparisons and rhetorical questions, indicate a sarcastic style.

- **underlying message**:
  - the speaker likely does not believe that the other person's views on ""gun crazy"" are valid. instead, they appear to mock or trivialize those views by drawing exaggerated and ironic comparisons.

### step 3: comparison and analysis:
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention**:
  - the surface sentiment is dismissive and confrontational.
  - the true intention, revealed through hyperbole and sarcasm, indicates that the speaker seeks to ridicule the other person's views.

- **inference**:
  - the statement is not a genuine inquiry or argument. instead, it uses sarcasm to mock the other person's understanding and beliefs.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""wow,"" ""lovely christian setaments and attitudes,"" ""i wonder what jesus would say,"" ""number one fan,"" ""statements of hate.""
- the juxtaposition of ""lovely"" and ""statements of hate"" indicates a contradictory tone.
- the word ""wow"" typically indicates amazement or surprise, often used sarcastically.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wow"" at the beginning sets a sarcastic tone, indicating that the speaker likely finds the ""christian setaments and attitudes"" to be anything but lovely.
- **language style:** the phrase ""i wonder what jesus would say"" is rhetorical and suggests criticism, implying that the actions or attitudes described are un-christian.
- the comment about ""statements of hate"" contradicts the term ""lovely,"" further suggesting the sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement may seem complimentary, but the true intention clearly reveals dissatisfaction and criticism.
- **inference:** the usage of contradictory adjectives and the rhetorical questioning strongly suggest a sarcastic tone.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the first sentence offers to provide factual information through a video, but the excessively elongated ""soooooooo"" followed by ""you were saying?"" implies a challenge or a negation of the other person's argument.
- **language style**: the elongation of ""so"" conveys impatience or mockery. ""you were saying?"" is often used to rhetorically question the validity of the other party's point of view.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is implying that the video will debunk or counter the other person's argument, showing that the initial statement (""for the actual difference between these guns and a real assault weapon"") is just a setup for the sarcastic challenge at the end.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: on the surface, the statement looks like it is providing helpful information. however, the true intention, revealed through the rhetorical style and the mocking tone of ""soooooooo you were saying?"", indicates that the speaker is sarcastically dismissing the other person's argument.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains a mix of condescending tones and a hint of exasperation. phrases like ""you would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay"" suggest an accusatory or dismissive attitude. the interjection of historical context with ""families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist"" and ""the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage"" pairs historical reflection with a critical tone. the use of the phrase ""yes, the fact that..."" indicates a facetious tone leading to exaggeration. the mention of ""fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonxrolleyes"" underscores sarcasm due to the emoticon indicating eye-rolling.

**step 2: true intention**
the true intention here seems to be ridiculing the romanticized view of historical family structures and moral standards. the speaker is not genuinely praising the past, but rather using exaggerated claims and irony to highlight the absurdity of those who idealize it. the emoticon adds further emphasis to this mockery.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
there's a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (superficial agreement with traditional values) and the true intention (ridicule and criticism of these views). the surface sentiment starts with seemingly affirmative statements but gradually devolves into obvious exaggeration and disdain, suggesting a sarcastic intention.

- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

#### step 2: true intention

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""i guess,"" ""we can't possibly,"" ""safe from kill-happy gunners""
- **sentimental phrases:** ""i guess"" generally introduces an assumption made in jest or resignation, ""we can't possibly"" suggests a contrary-to-fact statement or exaggeration, ""kill-happy gunners"" uses loaded language to describe firearms enthusiasts or those prone to violence with guns.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""we can't possibly be safe"" uses irony by implying the opposite—that the sentiment expressed is actually contrary to the literal meaning. the exaggerated phrase ""kill-happy gunners"" adds to the facetious tone by overemphasizing a specific perspective.
- **language style:** the sentence gives a sense of skepticism or disbelief presented in a sarcastic manner. the use of ""i guess"" softens the sarcasm but maintains a clear ironic tone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment uses exaggerated terms and ironic structure.
- the true intention behind the sentence is to mock the idea of safety from gun violence in america.
- given the loaded phrasing and rhetorical setup, the text is intended to be sarcastic, demonstrating disbelief in the claim it superficially expresses.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""did you get that from the film 'life of brian'?"" suggests a question.
- **context indicators:** the mention of ""romans nailed anyone up"" might refer to a historical fact, but the question could indicate something about the validity of the information source.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** ""did you get that from the film 'life of brian'?"" uses a reference to a well-known satirical comedy film, which likely implies that the prior statement is not to be taken seriously.
- **context analysis:** by referring to a comedic and satirical film to question the source of information, it likely implies that the original statement (""so the romans nailed anyone up that organised the community!"") is exaggerated, inaccurate, or intended humorously.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is a straightforward question. however, the true intention behind the question is to ridicule or undermine the seriousness of the initial statement by likening it to a comedy film.
- **inference:** the use of a comedic film reference to question the accuracy of a statement suggests that the true intention is sarcastic.

- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""o stiff-necked ones"", ""godless (evolution-minded) heathens"", ""lice-infected"", ""large-foreheaded"", ""knuckle-dragging"", ""rump-sniffing troglodytes"" are all highly offensive and derogatory terms.
- **emoji:** emoticonxbouncer conveys an aggressive, possibly confrontational mood.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the language is heavily laced with insults and derogatory remarks. the use of archaic terms like ""troglodytes"" and the phrase ""o stiff-necked ones"" adds a mocking tone.
- **context analysis:** the intense negativity and elaborateness of the insults suggest a strong emotional response, likely meant to demean and provoke. the speaker uses exaggerated language to express their disdain, implying they don't truly believe the recipients are literally all those things, but rather are using exaggerated terms to underscore their low opinion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is aggressive and negative, using strong language to deride. the true intention is to mock and insult the recipients in an exaggerated manner.

- **phrases:** ""and that every definition isn't appropriate in every situation?"" implies instruction or correction.
- **content:** the definition provided and the instructional tone suggest the writer is providing guidance or correction.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of rhetorical questions (""you are aware that... right?"", ""and that every definition isn't appropriate in every situation?"") implies that the writer believes the recipient should obviously know these things, indicating a form of criticism or disdain.
- **context analysis:** the overall tone of questioning someone's awareness about basic knowledge and then providing the correct definition indicates that the writer thinks the recipient should know better, which usually points to sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** while the surface might seem instructional or corrective, the rhetorical questions highlight an underlying critical and mocking tone.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the apparent instructional tone and the critical, mocking questions confirms that the label should be ""sarcastic.""

Input:
and sotomayor argued that the american people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. what's your point?

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment is mocking and dismissive. phrases like ""right to make an an a-s-s out of yourself"" and ""laugh my a-s-s off"" suggest ridicule. the use of frotflmao (falling right on the floor laughing my ass off) further indicates a mocking tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the rhetoric is clearly intended to belittle the other party. the exaggerated suggestion of traveling to see someone at a nude beach just to laugh at them indicates the speaker's intention to mock and not to be taken literally.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the alignment between the mocking tone in step 1 and the intention to deride in step 2 strongly suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""only the second president"", ""impeached"", ""certainly you might consider"", ""a tiny blemish"", ""sterling presidency"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxfrazzled (indicates frustration or disbelief).

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of the word ""only"" in ""only the second president"" downplays the seriousness of being impeached. the quotation marks around ""sterling"" suggest insincerity or sarcasm. the phrase ""certainly you might consider"" combined with ""a tiny blemish"" implies that the speaker believes it to be more than just a small flaw.
- **language style**: the language is laden with rhetorical devices that suggest sarcasm; phrases like ""sterling presidency"" in quotation marks and calling impeachment a ""tiny blemish"" indicate that the speaker does not really think the presidency was flawless.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is sarcastically emphasizing that being impeached is a significant negative mark on the president's record, contrary to the notion of having a ""sterling"" (perfect) presidency.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: while the surface sentiment of ""only the second president"" and ""tiny blemish"" may seem dismissive initially, the true intention revealed by the sarcastic use of ""sterling presidency"" and ""tiny blemish"" points to the opposite meaning. the speaker is highlighting the serious nature of the impeachment in a sarcastic manner.

    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""just to be clear,"" ""most founders were deists,"" ""you then change it,"" ""you moving the goal posts,"" ""doesn't make you right,"" ""washington wasn't a deist.""
- the phrases suggest a confrontational and corrective tone, challenging the other person's statements.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""just to be clear"" at the beginning implies an attempt to set the record straight, but also carries a tone of sarcasm. ""you moving the goal posts"" is a metaphorical accusation that suggests the other person is being dishonest or inconsistent. the phrase “doesn’t make you right” is condescending.
- **language style:** the statement is accusatory and dismissive, showing frustration and a need to correct perceived errors by the other party. 
- **context:** the intention is to criticize and undermine the credibility of the other person’s argument by pointing out inconsistencies and factual errors.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement is corrective and confrontational. the true intention, however, is to mock and dismiss the other person's arguments, as evidenced by the accusatory tone and condescending phrases.

- the emoji, ""emoticonxclown,"" might imply a humorous or mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""better still"" suggests an alternative option that is supposedly better but is framed in a way that implies it's unrealistic or absurd. 
- **language style:** the casual and seemingly simple suggestion to go to an ""army barracks"" and explain something to soldiers can imply a dismissive tone, suggesting that it is a ridiculous or impossible task.
- **context:** the true intention seems to be to point out the impracticality or absurdity of the suggestion, using an over-the-top example.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it appears to be a straightforward suggestion with an emoji that mocks. the true intention, however, is clearly dismissive, indicating that the suggestion is absurd and not meant to be taken seriously.
- **inference:** the casual, exaggerated example along with the mocking emoji strongly suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** use of rhetorical questions (""isn't that morality?"" ""who gives a flying fark about 'innateness'?"") implies skepticism or disbelief. the phrase ""one iota of actuality is worth a millionfold of your 'innateness'"" is hyperbolic and dismissive.
- **language style:** the language is informal, dismissive, and strongly critical.
- **context:** the speaker is denigrating the concept of ""innateness,"" suggesting that practical reality is far more important.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement appears to question and dismiss the importance of ""innateness."" the true intention is to express strong criticism and disdain for the concept of ""innateness,"" favoring practicality instead.

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","i will analyze the text step by step to ensure accurate classification:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the text contains phrases such as ""the bot stuff is utter bull,"" and ""feel free to make a spectacle of yourself,"" which indicate strong disapproval and mockery. the phrase ""of course there is a point"" further hints at potential sarcasm by setting up a seemingly contradictory statement. the term ""feel free"" often implies permission but in a context that suggests the speaker believes the action is foolish.

**step 2: true intention**
by examining the rhetorical devices and language style, it appears the speaker is not genuinely trying to support a point but instead is mocking the other person. the statement “feel free to make a spectacle of yourself” is dismissive and ridicules the other person's actions. the final sentence “support your assertion out by my co-signer status?” adds to the confusion and shows a disinterest in the actual content of the response, which reinforces the mocking tone.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
the surface sentiment indicates mockery and disapproval, and the true intention aligns with this by using sarcasm to ridicule the other person's stance and actions. the mismatched phrasing further indicates sarcasm rather than any genuine concern or interest.

by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe in or support the idea of mandatory firearm lockdown or the strict gun laws in chicago. the use of phrases such as ""some genius,"" ""yea right,"" and the sarcastic questioning of compliance with illinois gun laws suggest the speaker is ridiculing the effectiveness of these laws and the idea of mandatory firearm lockdowns.

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.

### analysis:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""i have heard of"" repeated multiple times establishes a set-up for a punchline or sarcastic twist.
- sentimental phrases: the statement ""there is just something not right about including the word gay and head in the same sentence."" along with the emoji "":p"".
- overall sentiment: the use of an exaggerated setup and the playful emoji at the end imply a humorous rather than serious critique.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the repetition and list format build up anticipation for a final twist, which is delivered with irony regarding ""gay-headed families"".
- language style: the use of the emoji "":p"" typically denotes light-heartedness or a tongue-in-cheek statement.
- underlying message: the intention is to make a humorous observation by using an exaggerated and ironic statement about the phrase ""gay-headed families"".

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: while the surface sentiment might appear as a critique or discomfort with a certain phrase, the true intention is clearly humor and not a genuine statement of belief.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

- **language style**: the style is highly sarcastic, dripping with mockery. the rolling eyes emoji (""emoticonxrolleyes"") further exacerbates the dismissive sentiment, signaling frustration or disbelief at the other's ignorance.

#### step 3: compare and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: both the surface and true sentiments align in their condescension and mockery towards the other person’s perceived lack of knowledge.
- **inference**: the uniformity between the mocking surface sentiment and the true intention solidifies the sarcastic tone.

### Example:
Input:
and sotomayor argued that the american people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. what's your point?

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

- the use of ""good one, truthsayer"" suggests a compliment on a sarcastic level.
- ""lol!"" and the emoticon "":p"" indicate a playful or mocking tone.
- the phrase ""gotta be from texas"" with the preceding ""a rich white woman"" implies a stereotype that is often humorously exaggerated.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the term ""truthsayer"" might sarcastically imply that the person being addressed is not actually telling the truth.
- the laughing out loud ""lol!"" coupled with ""gotta be from texas"" suggests that the speaker is ridiculing the stereotype of a rich white woman from texas, implying it's a cliché.
- the overall structure of the message, with exaggerated and playful phrases, hints at a mocking or sarcastic intention rather than a serious statement.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- both the surface sentiment and the deep analysis point to a tone that mocks and does not seriously endorse the statements being made.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears mocking and contemptuous. phrases like ""the smartest man in the world"" and ""doesn't have the sense to realize it"" indicate a sarcastic and critical tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""smartest man in the world"" is used ironically to criticize the person's lack of awareness. the mention of a ""failed state"" adds a negative connotation.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence heavily relies on irony. it starts with praise (""the smartest man in the world"") but immediately contradicts it with a disparaging remark (""doesn't have the sense to realize it"").
- **language style**: the sarcastic tone is underscored by the exaggeration of intelligence juxtaposed with a severe criticism of the person's awareness.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment is sarcastic and critical, which aligns with the true intention of mocking the individual’s intelligence by pointing out their ignorance.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** there is a strong usage of sarcasm through irony and criticism. the use of ""perfect"" at the beginning sets an ironic tone, and the description of creationists repeating refuted arguments and being cowards is meant to mock and belittle them.
- **context analysis:** the speaker is criticizing creationists for continuously using debunked arguments and then avoiding confrontation by moving to other forums.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""osama bin ladens,"" ""killed,"" ""????"" (indicates strong emotion), ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (indicates exasperation or disbelief).
- the sentence appears to express frustration or disbelief.

step 2: **true intention**

Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the statement contains strong language and an aggressive tone, with phrases like ""a predominant lack of logic or reason"" and ""your position has been proven wrong, get over it."" these indicate a condescending and dismissive attitude toward the other person in the discussion.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker appears to be attacking the other person's argument and character by stating they have a ""predominant lack of logic or reason"" and demanding they ""get over it"" because their position has been ""proven wrong."" the intention is to belittle and invalidate the other person's opinion rather than engage in a logical discussion.

the surface sentiment of condescension and dismissiveness matches the true intention of belittling and invalidating the other person's argument. the tone is straightforward and there is no indication of ridiculing or mocking meant as sarcasm. it seems to be a genuine expression of contempt rather than sarcastic.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears critical and condescending. keywords and phrases like ""isn't even aware,"" ""just-so answers,"" and ""he has never read"" indicate a dismissive and belittling tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""isn't even aware"" and ""it seems that he has never read"" contribute to a patronizing and superior tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence utilizes sarcasm, marked by a mocking tone and the exaggeration of archy's supposed ignorance. the use of ""my god!"" is an exclamation that highlights the speaker’s incredulity and disdain.
- **language style**: the style is condescending and sarcastic, implying that archy is woefully uninformed about a well-known and complex topic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems extremely critical, almost mocking. the underlying intention is to belittle archy's knowledge by implying it is deficient in a sarcastically exaggerated manner.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent criticism and the exaggerated disbelief establishes the sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases include mock humility (""sorry, my bad.""), potential sarcasm in pointing out ""tiny holes in my argument,"" and self-congratulation (""i'm quite proud of myself."").

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** ""ooops, typo. sorry, my bad"" suggests a forced or insincere apology, aiming to downplay the importance of the typo. the phrase ""don't let that dissuade you in your search for tiny holes in my argument"" implies that the speaker believes the critic is being overly pedantic. the phrase ""i'm quite proud of myself"" hints at irony, as the speaker is probably mocking the effort taken to find a minor flaw.
- **language style:** the language style is defensive yet patronizing, mocking the effort of the critic to point out a minor error and sarcastically pointing out the alleged insignificance.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention reveal sarcasm. the phrases used indicate a defensive stance, mock humility, and a patronizing tone, all typical of sarcasm.

the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the input text is filled with laughter ""hahahhahahahahahahahaahhaahahahahahahahaah"" several times, indicating that the speaker finds something very funny. phrases like ""thats all i can say"" and ""i guess i should keep my jokes to myself?"" suggest that the speaker might be responding to feedback or a reaction from someone else about their joke. the statement ""my sister got that one"" signals that at least one person understood or appreciated the joke.

### step 2: true intention
the excessive laughter and the rhetorical question ""i guess i should keep my jokes to myself?"" hint at a likely sarcastic response to an unenthusiastic or confused reaction from another person. the speaker may be mocking the idea that their joke wasn't well received or understood by everyone, except for their sister who ""got that one"". the continued laughter (""still laughing"") reinforces this notion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a mismatch between the surface sentiment (amused and laughing) and the true intention (ridiculing or mocking the audience's reaction to the joke). the use of exaggerated laughter and rhetorical questions indicates sarcasm, as the speaker is not genuinely amused but rather making fun of the situation.

the statement appears to acknowledge the ease of immoral actions compared to moral ones. phrases like ""easier to take the immoral path,"" ""stealing's easier than working,"" ""lying's easier than telling the truth,"" and ""being a deadbeat parent is easier than being a good parent"" indicate a comparison of effort between moral and immoral behaviors. the tone is matter-of-fact and somewhat resigned as it lists various examples.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention behind this statement seems to be pointing out the ease of immoral behaviors in a way that highlights the difficulty and value of taking the moral path. by listing specific examples and stating ""the list goes on and on,"" the speaker seems to underscore the prevalence and temptation of easier, but less ethical, choices.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there isn’t a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment and the true intention. the surface sentiment recognizes immorality's ease, while the true intention emphasizes this to critique or reflect on moral choices. the statement does not employ hyperbole, ridicule, or dramatic overreaction, which are common in sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

Again I have to correct you. Dark moths were not observed before 1848. Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moths both in Europe and in the United States.

Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

**clues:** 
- keywords and phrases like ""again i have to correct you,"" ""you didn't bother to inform yourself,"" and ""after having been informed of your error"" indicate a critical and confrontational tone.
- the consistent correction of another person's statements and the dismissal of their understanding suggest frustration and possibly irritation.

**sentiments:** 
- overall sentiments appear negative, with emphasis on correcting and accusing the other person of neglecting facts.

### step 2: true intention deduction
**rhetorical devices and style:** 
- the repetition of corrections (""again i have to correct you"") indicates a level of disdain or irritation. 
- the assertion that the other person keeps ""return[ing] to your incorrect assertion again and again"" implies a frustration with having to repeatedly address the same issue.
- the statement, ""you didn't bother to inform yourself of the facts,"" suggests an accusatory tone, emphasizing the other person's perceived negligence or ignorance.

**true meaning:** 
- the speaker is genuinely frustrated and critical of the other person’s repeated factual inaccuracies.
- the direct language and lack of exaggeration or irony suggest that the speaker intends to convey their frustration and corrections straightforwardly, without sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a consistent tone of frustration and correction.

  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases describe extreme and exaggerated actions or scenarios, which often are not common in everyday situations.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the question's exaggerated scenarios (carrying grenades, heavy gear, calling in airstrikes) suggest that it is not meant to be taken literally. these elements of hyperbole are often indicators of sarcasm.
- **language style:** the mention of highly unlikely or extreme scenarios is a typical sarcastic method to ridicule or challenge the authenticity of the subject, implying that the described actions are unrealistic or far-fetched.

    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

- **question style:** the use of rhetorical questions like ""these don't strike you as cruel and unusual?"" suggests a strong implication or expectation.

### step 2: true intention

- **irony/sarcasm indicators:** the exaggerated scenarios and the way they are posed as questions imply that the speaker finds the idea that these situations are not cruel and unusual to be absurd.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** 
  - ""sorry to brake it to ya"" suggests a preface to disappointing or harsh news.
  - ""it's gonna one big war"" indicates a negative event.
  - ""why should we even care"" conveys a sense of apathy or hopelessness.
  - ""might as well start war now and get it over with"" implies cynicism or resignation.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** 
  - the use of phrases like ""sorry to brake it to ya"" and ""i'm not one of those crazy lunes"" indicates a casual and informal tone, potentially masking deeper cynicism or irony.
  - the phrase ""why should we even care"" followed by ""might as well start war now and get it over with"" uses rhetorical questions and resignation to emphasize a sense of futility or mock-desperation.
  
### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment displays a negative outlook towards world events and a sense of hopelessness. the use of rhetorical devices and informal language suggests the writer is employing sarcasm to communicate a deeper critique of current events or societal attitudes.

  - ""wiki reference, that i can edit myself""
  - ""emoticonxwow""
  - ""do you just pull statements from your posterior?""

these phrases and the emoticon suggest that the speaker is incredulous, mocking, and confrontational.

#### step 2: true intention
- ""you're pulling my leg, right?"": this is a rhetorical question that implies disbelief and suggests the topic or point is absurd.
- ""i've been hiring scientists for well over 20 years now"": this statement establishes the speaker's authority and experience, implying that the countering argument is not credible.
- mentioning ""a wiki reference, that i can edit myself"": this phrase mocks the reliability of the wiki reference.
- use of ""emoticonxwow"": typically used to express exaggerated amazement or skepticism.
- ""do you just pull statements from your posterior?"": a sarcastic and rhetorical question implying that the other person's statements are baseless or nonsensical.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and the true intention both point towards a tone that is mocking and dismissive of the other person's argument. the usage of rhetorical questions and sarcasm-laden phrases clearly indicates that the speaker is not serious about the points they are addressing, but rather intends to belittle the argument presented by the other person.

the statements contain rhetorical devices and language that are sarcastic in nature, aiming to mock the credibility and logic of the opposing argument.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **true meaning:** the speaker is criticizing the person and entities involved (dick armey, bankers, and companies) for their hypocrisy and reliance on government aid, while humorously suggesting that they should be ignored and left to deal with their issues on their own.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the use of hyperbole and extreme imagery (""a hot poker shoved up my bottom"") suggests that the speaker doesn't genuinely consider this a realistic or serious option but is instead using it to dramatically underscore a point. this is a common sarcastic technique, exaggerating consequences to absurdity to mock or downplay the initial scenario.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment indicates a choice between two undesirable options. however, the exaggerated and absurd nature of the alternative (hot poker) highlights sarcasm. the speaker uses hyperbole to trivialize or ridicule the idea, indicating a sarcastic tone.

"I was in a restaurant and as I left, the waitress said that I was supposed to leave 10%
""I was hungry"", I replied emoticonXAngel",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and contains a hint of sarcasm. keywords like ""supposed to leave 10%"" and the casual, almost dismissive response ""i was hungry"" contribute to this sentiment.
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase “supposed to leave 10%"" is a typical prompt often associated with expected behavior (like tipping), while the response ""i was hungry"" does not align with this prompt in a serious tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony. the rhetorical device employed here is the non-sequitur; the response ""i was hungry"" sarcastically deflects the implied request for a tip by stating an unrelated fact (hunger).
- **language style**: the language style is casual and dismissive, with the irony implying that the speaker is avoiding the social convention of tipping by offering a non-serious excuse.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems dismissive, and upon closer examination, it reveals sarcasm. the dismissive response to the waitress’s comment about leaving a tip is an ironic deflection rather than a serious statement.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the expected response (perhaps acknowledging the tipping culture) and the actual response (""i was hungry"") establishes the sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **emojis/emoticons**: none.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses sarcasm in the phrase ""thanks for contributing absolutely nothing"" and ""talks cheap"". the tone is highly critical and dismissive.
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""contributing absolutely nothing"", ""unfounded claims"", and ""talks cheap"" employs a strong negative tone. the mention of ""proven you've got plenty of that since showing up here"" implies disdain for the individual's input.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker does not actually thank the individual but rather criticizes them for not providing valuable contributions and for making claims without evidence.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment appears polite initially with ""thanks"", but the true intention is revealed as mocking and criticizing. the negative phrases like ""absolutely nothing"" and ""talks cheap"" substantiate the true sentiment, which is sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""i wasn't aware that the candidates were the ones allowed to ask the debate questions. emoticonxconfused""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears to be a polite inquiry. however, the use of quotes around ""truth"" and the challenging nature of the question suggests the true intention is to criticize or mock the idea being presented.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the polite surface sentiment and the challenging underlying intention indicates the sentence is likely meant to be sarcastic.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

- clues: the use of questions indicates a probing, possibly critical stance.
- sentimental phrases: the phrases ""should be able to fire black people just for being black"" and ""should we allow that as well?"" contain strong connotations and highlight controversial themes.
- overall sentiment: the questions seem designed to challenge or criticize a particular viewpoint, suggesting a disapproving tone.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions and extreme examples (""fire black people just for being black"", ""fire somebody for being christian"") suggests the speaker doesn't genuinely support these actions but is using them to make a point.
- language style: the repeated use of hypotheticals with moral implications indicates a possibly ironic stance. the phrase ""or just the issues that you don't agree with..."" implies that the speaker believes the audience is hypocritical.
- underlying message: the speaker is questioning the logic or fairness of allowing discriminatory practices, likely implying that doing so is ridiculous.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: while the apparent sentiment is a series of critical questions, the tone and rhetorical style signal deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention appears to mock the inconsistency and hypocrisy of the stance being questioned, highlighting its absurdity.

- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

#### step 2: true intention

- clues: phrases like ""settle down charlie"" and ""try to think rationally, just for a second"" hint at a condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""i'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's"" uses exaggeration and improbable scenarios to make a point.
- overall sentiment: the statement appears factual on the surface but contains elements that suggest mockery or a dismissive attitude towards the addressee's point of view.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the use of sarcasm is evident in the exaggerated scenario of tumors growing into sentient life forms and the hyperbolic suggestion of planning a ""save the tumor"" rally.
- language style: the language is direct and contains irony, especially in the context of asking for ""a link documenting such an occurrence"" and the sarcastic comment about planning a rally.
- underlying message: the speaker does not genuinely want proof of tumors becoming sentient but rather intends to mock the pro-life argument by comparing it to an absurd scenario.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment could come off as a harsh critique, but the tone, exaggerated scenarios, and ironic suggestions signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to engage in a serious discussion but to mock the other person's viewpoint sarcastically.

"What say you, Archie? Are you going to put any meaning into your accusations, or will you chicken out because you know that I'm right and that you're full of balderdash?",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

what say you, archie? are you going to put any meaning into your accusations, or will you chicken out because you know that i'm right and that you're full of balderdash?

### step by step analysis

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains questioning and taunting language. phrases like ""are you going to put any meaning into your accusations"" and ""or will you chicken out"" indicate a challenge or provocation. terms like ""you're full of balderdash"" further suggest dismissive and insulting sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
the speaker appears to be mocking archie, implying that his accusations are baseless (""put any meaning into your accusations"") and predicting that he will not follow through because he knows he's wrong (""chicken out""). the use of the word ""balderdash"" (nonsense) highlights that the speaker doesn't take archie's accusations seriously and is ridiculing him.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
the surface sentiment of taunting and challenging aligns closely with the true intention of mocking and ridiculing archie. the exaggerated language (""full of balderdash"") and the questioning format used to provoke a defensive reaction from archie are clear indicators of sarcasm.

    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.

the surface sentiment appears to be incredulous and perhaps even sardonic. this is indicated by the rhetorical nature of the question and the juxtaposition of materials (aluminum, steel, and polymer) with narcotic substances, which are typically not recognized as addictive or mind-altering.

### step 2:
the true intention behind the sentence seems to be to mock or question the legitimacy or absurdity of an idea that such non-narcotic materials could be recognized as addictive substances. the exaggerated comparison hints at a disbelief that such a question would even need asking, suggesting a rhetorical and sarcastic tone.

### step 3:
the contradiction between the nature of substances typically known to affect mental status (narcotics) and mundane, non-addictive materials (aluminum, steel, polymer) implies sarcasm. the incredulous tone also supports this interpretation.

  - ""short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, i'm afraid boys will be boys"" uses extreme language and a common idiom implying inevitability.

### Example:
Input:
""here we go again. emoticonxrolleyes another bible thumping straight individual with no formal training in the subject matter, professing to be an expert on how homosexuals feel. get a life.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""i'm not going to waste my time"" indicates a strong emotional reaction, suggesting annoyance or disdain.
- sentimental phrases: ""lining up to be a perennial pit dweller"" uses figurative language, carrying a negative connotation that implies the subject is willingly putting themselves in a bad situation permanently.
- overall sentiment: the sentence gives an impression of judgment and dismissal, possibly an attempt to belittle or criticize the subject.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""lining up to be a perennial pit dweller"") to exaggerate the situation. the phrase is also metaphorical, implying that the person being referred to is destined for failure or a bad situation by their own choice.
- language style: the language is direct, assertive, and carries an air of superiority. the figurative language and exaggeration suggest a deeper intention than the literal meaning.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not believe that the subject is actually willingly choosing a bad situation, but rather is mocking their perceived poor decision-making.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment comes off as a harsh critique, but the figurative language and exaggeration indicate a mocking or derisive tone.
- inference: the true intention of the statement is likely to mock and belittle the subject rather than provide a genuine critique.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.

You have no legitimate individual freedoms or rights. Only the false promises and definitions of these things society offers you. Maybe when you were gay-bashed, you should have thought about what the meaning of your so-called rights was.

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: the use of words such as ""absurd,"" ""retarded,"" ""no legitimate,"" and ""false promises"" indicate a highly critical and disdainful tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""you have no legitimate individual freedoms or rights,"" ""false promises,"" ""absurd to the point of being retarded,"" ""maybe when you were gay-bashed.""
- overall sentiment: the choice of words suggests a harsh, critical, and condemnatory tone that borders on being offensive.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the statement employs hyperbole (""absurd to the point of being retarded"") and derogatory language (""retarded""). additionally, the use of ""maybe when you were gay-bashed"" brings in a sarcastic rhetorical question.
- language style: direct and confrontational, with elements of mockery and sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not genuinely believe in the lack of individual freedoms or rights but uses extreme language to criticize the perceived naivety or beliefs of the audience.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment is extremely harsh and critical. the exaggerated and derogatory language suggests that the true intention is to mock and belittle the audience rather than present a logical argument.
- inference: the tone and rhetorical devices used indicate a deeply sarcastic attitude.

- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**

### Example:
Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""sounds like a lot of ***bull***"" is sarcastic and dismissive, indicating disbelief or ridicule.

"You really don't get it. The best thing about a free market is when someone acts like a fool they get burned. Thanks to government intervention and regulation when someone acts like a fool they get bailed out.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Response:

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement contains a critique of government intervention and regulation, contrasting it with the outcomes in a free market. phrases like ""when someone acts like a fool they get burned"" have a negative connotation towards those who make poor decisions, while ""they get bailed out"" implies undeserved rescue. the statement ""if you like we can have the trains run like amtrak"" suggests dissatisfaction with amtrak, implying it is a suboptimal example.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize government intervention. by stating ""when someone acts like a fool they get bailed out"" and then suggesting ""we can have the trains run like amtrak,"" the speaker is implying that government intervention leads to inefficiency or failure, contrasting it with the supposed accountability in a free market. the phrase about amtrak is a rhetorical device meant to illustrate perceived government inefficiency sarcastically.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment seems to be frustration with the outcomes of government intervention. the true intention reveals that the speaker is using sarcasm to highlight their belief that government intervention protects incompetence and leads to inefficiencies, as exemplified by the mention of amtrak. the exaggerated and ironic mention of trains running like amtrak strongly suggests sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""pulling our legs,"" ""simply not true,"" ""truer words were never spoken.""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

#### step 2: true intention

- **language style:** the progression of statements leads to a critical deconstruction of the arguments, employing skepticism and irony to counter positions against evolution.

"I guess then you better get rid of your small game rifle. The .22 lr is a round that has killed a mass number of people.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of ""i guess"" and the phrase about getting rid of a rifle set up a sarcastic tone. the exaggerated statement about the .22 lr killing a mass number of people enhances this sarcasm, mocking the idea that such a small caliber round is a ""mass-killing machine."" the sign-off ""seriously though, please elaborate on what you consider to be a mass killing machine"" breaks the sarcasm and asks for a genuine explanation, reinforcing that the preceding statements were not serious.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- ""let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals.""

- the sentences contain skepticism (""hmmmmm,"" ""wow"") and a critical tone toward someone's argument or method.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **sarcasm**: the phrase ""hmmmmm"" shows doubt or disbelief. ""reaction formation much?"" seems to mock someone's behavior by attaching a psychological term to it.
  - **sarcasm**: ""wow. i didn't know refuting an analysis was possible by religiously adhering to the concepts you are trying to prove nonexistent"" suggests disbelief and criticism, indicating that the speaker finds the argument illogical or hypocritical.
- **deduction**: the speaker is sarcastically pointing out the perceived irony or inconsistency in someone's argument.

### step 3: compare and analysis

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement contains a mix of complimentary language and rhetorical questions which seem to defend or rationalize the behaviors or reputations of bill clinton, ted kennedy, and robert byrd. phrases such as ""i don't think that bill clinton has to 'force' himself upon women"" and ""ted kennedy has spent a lifetime repenting of his drunkenness"" appear to mitigate accusations against them. the statement ""when are you going attack doddering old, near-to-death robert byrd"" implies a defense against attacks on robert byrd.

### step 2: true intention
the rhetoric and tone used suggest the speaker is not sincerely defending these individuals but rather using sarcasm to criticize what they perceive as hypocrisy or unfair targeting. the exaggerated descriptions and rhetorical questions imply disbelief in the sincerity of the perceived repentance and defense of bill clinton and ted kennedy. the mention of ""doddering old, near-to-death robert byrd"" has a ridiculing tone, further indicating sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the apparent surface sentiment of defending these individuals doesn't align with the underlying sarcasm in questioning their integrity and the sincerity of their actions. the tone and exaggerated manner suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to criticize the individuals mentioned and to mock the concept that they are being unjustly attacked.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

    - the repetitive questioning (""did you even read"") indicates frustration and disbelief. terms like ""weasel out of it"" carry a judgmental, accusatory tone.

2. **true intention:**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the repeated questioning implies that the speaker doesn't actually believe the other party read the op or the title, underscoring their frustration and criticizing their argument tactics.
    - **language style:** the tone is accusatory and condescending, with phrases like ""pointless distinction"" minimizing the other's arguments and ""weasel out of it"" depicting dishonesty.
    - **context:** the intention is to expose perceived inconsistencies and dishonesty in the other party's arguments.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""oh he won't read that"", ""american in exile"", ""does not even live here anymore"", ""just disappears for a while when the heat is on"", ""resurface with his same propaganda after the heat has died down"".
- **sentimental phrases**: phrases such as ""just disappears for a while when the heat is on"" and ""resurface with his same propaganda"" indicate a negative or critical sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses irony and criticism:
  - ""oh he won't read that"": the use of ""oh"" suggests an informal and dismissive tone.
  - ""american in exile"": this suggests the person is avoiding some responsibility or criticism and highlights a form of disapproval.
  - ""resurface with his same propaganda"": indicates that the person is repeatedly pushing their ideas, which the speaker seems to find unchangeable and frustrating.
- **language style**: informal, dismissive, and critical.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is negative and dismissive, reinforced by phrases like ""resurface with his same propaganda"". the true intention, revealed by the rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and criticize the individual for their perceived lack of engagement or avoidance of criticism.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be confrontational or challenging. the usage of ""your adversaries appreciate it greatly"" suggests skepticism or doubt, and ""which part of the parades do you suppose they focus on to demonize you?"" implies a confrontational stance.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the word ""appreciate"" in this context is used sarcastically. the speaker doesn't believe that the ""adversaries"" genuinely appreciate the parades. instead, they suggest that the adversaries are using the parades to criticize or demonize the subject. the rhetorical question ""which part of the parades do you suppose they focus on to demonize you?"" is intended to highlight that the adversaries are actively looking for faults or weaknesses.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment and true intention both point towards a sarcastic attitude. the speaker is mocking the notion that the adversaries would appreciate the parades, instead suggesting that the adversaries would focus on negative aspects.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **clues:** the phrase ""i assume you can demonstrate that everyone that opposes or critiques gay rights are personally attacking an individual or group?"" and the follow-up ""please, be my guest"" are key phrases.
* **sentiments:** the use of ""i assume"" and ""please, be my guest"" indicates a level of skepticism or challenge, potentially implying disbelief or mockery of the ability to demonstrate such a claim.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the phrase ""i assume you can demonstrate"" is likely not a genuine assumption but rather a rhetorical question intended to challenge the person addressed. the inclusion of ""please, be my guest"" further emphasizes a dismissive, sarcastic tone. the speaker is likely critiquing the idea that all opposition to gay rights equates to personal attacks, suggesting it's an exaggerated or unfounded claim.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is likely mocking or challenging the notion that opposition to gay rights is always a personal attack on individuals or groups, conveying skepticism and irony.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment carries a tone of skepticism and challenge, and the true intention confirms this as a rhetorical, mocking statement challenging the idea presented. the sarcastic challenge and mockery are evident.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

- **clues**: the question format (""pro-lifers are like slave traders?"") indicates a potentially provocative or incredulous tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: the repeated questioning and use of extreme comparisons involve emotional engagement.
- **overall sentiment**: the overall tone appears to mix incredulity with strong objection, suggesting that the speaker finds the comparison absurd. 

### step 2: true intention

- **language style**: direct and assertive, which often signals sarcasm in highlighting the perceived absurdity of the comparison.
- **underlying message**: the speaker likely does not believe that ""pro-lifers"" are equivalent to ""slave traders"" but is mocking the perceived absurdity of such a comparison.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention**: the surface sentiment of incredulity and objection aligns with the true intention of mocking the analogy. the directness and extreme comparison are used to highlight sarcasm.

        ","let's break down the input step-by-step to determine if it is sarcastic or not.

### step 1: surface sentiment

- keywords and sentimental phrases include:
  - ""you your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that?""
  - ""i suspect that you are talking out of your elbow""
  - ""since i haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is.""
  - ""mostly i see hysteria and superstition in your posts.""

- the surface sentiment seems dismissive and confrontational. phrases like ""talking out of your elbow"" and referring to ""hysteria and superstition"" suggest a negative and mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention

- the question ""you your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that?"" insinuates that the person being addressed is not qualified to make logical judgments.
- the phrase ""i suspect that you are talking out of your elbow"" is an idiomatic expression implying that the person is speaking nonsense.
- ""i haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is"" further undermines the credibility of the person being addressed.
- referring to the posts as filled with ""hysteria and superstition"" adds to the overall mocking and dismissive tone.

### step 3: compare and analyze

- the surface sentiment of being dismissive, mocking, and confrontational matches the deeper intent of ridiculing the person's logical capabilities.
- the exaggerated and negative language suggests sarcasm.

based on the above steps, the input text exhibits signs of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: do you know how many osama bin ladens we killed???? emoticonxrolleyes

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""osama bin ladens,"" ""killed,"" ""????"" (indicates strong emotion), ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (indicates exasperation or disbelief).
- the sentence appears to express frustration or disbelief.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **hyperbole**: the phrase ""how many osama bin ladens"" suggests exaggeration since there is only one osama bin laden.
  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows strong emotion and exasperation.
- the true intention is to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation, indicating a mismatch between what is said and what is meant.
- this difference is a hallmark of sarcasm.

math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.

### step-by-step analysis:

step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""math is confusing,"" ""doesn't mean we should get rid of it.""
- there is a surface expression of frustration or acknowledgement that math is confusing.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **analogy**: comparing the confusion caused by math to something else that might be confusing.
  - **logical argument**: the sentence is structured to make a point by comparing two ideas.
- **deduction**: the speaker is using the statement to argue against the idea of getting rid of something just because it is confusing. this implies that despite the confusion, it has value.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows frustration or challenging the rationale behind eliminating something purely because it is confusing.
- the true intention is to highlight the illogic of removing something valuable (implied to be something other than math) because it is confusing, using math as an example.
- this difference implies sarcasm, as the statement is not genuinely suggesting getting rid of math but using it to make a broader point.

"Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears mocking and cynical. keywords and phrases like ""lie, cheat, steal"" and ""wild, illicit sex"" contribute to a critical and disdainful tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""all of the ex-christians have it both ways"" and the ironic use of ""following the example of several christian preachers"" add to the mocking sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence employs sarcasm and irony, especially in the assumption that ex-christians are exploiting their 'saved' status for immoral behavior, supposedly following the example of christian preachers who have behaved badly.
- **language style**: the style is caustic and biting, intended to belittle or mock the hypocrisy perceived in both ex-christians and some preachers.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment is critical and mocking, and this aligns well with the underlying sarcasm. the assumption that ex-christians behave immorally because they believe they’re ‘saved’ and the sarcastic implication about christian preachers’ behavior reinforces the sarcasm.
- **inference**: the critical and scornful tone throughout the sentence, paired with the irony and mockery towards both ex-christians and preachers, underscores the sarcastic nature of the statement.

- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""what part of 12 trillion dollars (and growing) in debt is so hard to comprehend?"" indicates frustration or disbelief.
- **emphasis:** the capitalization of ""trillion"" and the inclusion of ""(and growing)"" indicate strong emphasis.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of a rhetorical question implies that the speaker believes the situation should be obvious. the capitalization and emphasis imply frustration with how obvious the situation is.
- **context analysis:** the speaker is highlighting a large, seemingly incomprehensible amount of debt and suggesting that it should be easy to understand, implicitly criticizing those who do not understand or acknowledge the severity of the debt.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** while the surface sentiment shows frustration, the rhetorical question and emphasis indicate that the speaker is criticizing others’ failure to comprehend the severity of the debt.
- **inference:** the rhetorical nature and the implicit criticism confirm the use of sarcasm. the discrepancy between the surface expression of frustration and the true intention of criticizing others’ understanding supports the label ""sarcastic.""

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""ralph,"" ""big white telephone.""
- the phrase ""go talk to ralph on the big white telephone"" doesn't directly convey obvious sentiment. however, ""talk to ralph"" and ""big white telephone"" might be idiomatic or euphemistic.
  
**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **euphemism**: the phrase ""talk to ralph on the big white telephone"" is a euphemism for vomiting (or being sick).
  - the language is somewhat humorous and indirect, which can sometimes suggest sarcasm.
- **deduction**: the sentence is likely stating that the person felt sick and had to vomit, using a humorous way to describe it.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment seems neutral or lightly humorous due to the indirect way of saying ""vomit.""
- the true intention is to express that someone was so sick that they had to vomit, but this is said in a way that adds humor rather than sarcasm.
- there is no mismatch between what is said and what is meant, so it doesn't appear to be sarcastic.

- **tone:** the tone appears to challenge and question the opposing viewpoint with phrases like ""why then, would you suggest something so absurd as to abortion hurts women"" and ""since when has antiabortionists cared about women?""

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of phrases like ""so absurd,"" and the rhetorical question at the end (""since when has antiabortionists cared about women?"") indicates irony or sarcasm. the speaker seems to be criticizing anti-abortionists by implying that their purported concern for women is insincere or hypocritical.
- **context analysis:** the speaker is questioning the motives of anti-abortionists in a way that suggests disbelief in their genuine concern for women. the rhetorical questions and tone indicate that they find the idea hypocritical.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** although the surface sentiment mentions positive aspects of abortion, the true intention reveals a critique of anti-abortionists and highlights an underlying belief that their concerns are not genuine.

""here we go again. emoticonxrolleyes another bible thumping straight individual with no formal training in the subject matter, professing to be an expert on how homosexuals feel. get a life.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- **keywords and phrases**: ""apparently you refuse to accept the fact"", ""duh!!"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: none were used, but ""duh!!"" serves a similar purpose to convey obviousness or exasperation.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement utilizes sarcasm, implied by the phrase ""apparently you refuse to accept the fact"" followed by ""duh!!"". this combination suggests that the speaker is frustrated by what they perceive as a basic misunderstanding or ignorance.
- **language style**: the word ""apparently"" used at the beginning indicates a condescending tone. the use of ""duh!!"" emphasizes the speaker's belief that the information should be obvious.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is implying that the difference between ""test"" and ""measure"" should be obvious, and is frustrated that the listener is not acknowledging this distinction.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the surface sentiment is dismissive and exasperated, as indicated by ""duh!!"". the true intention, derived from the rhetorical device of sarcasm, supports this as the speaker's way of belittling the other person's understanding.

"Yea, at least on earth you get some relief, you die eventually.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
and sotomayor argued that the american people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. what's your point?

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

yea, at least on earth you get some relief, you die eventually.

### step-by-step analysis:

step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of cynicism and dark humor. phrases like ""at least on earth you get some relief"" and ""you die eventually"" imply a negative but resigned tone.

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the phrase ""at least on earth"" introduces a comparison that is not entirely earnest. the statement ""you die eventually"" is used as a form of dark humor. the entire sentence seems to downplay the notion of relief by suggesting that death is the only form of it, which introduces an element of exaggeration and irony.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the comparison and the use of dark humor suggest an ironic undertone. the apparent contradiction (finding ""relief"" in death) pointed out through exaggeration further supports that the speaker is being sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""osama bin ladens,"" ""killed,"" ""????"" (indicates strong emotion), ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (indicates exasperation or disbelief).
- the sentence appears to express frustration or disbelief.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **hyperbole**: the phrase ""how many osama bin ladens"" suggests exaggeration since there is only one osama bin laden.
  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows strong emotion and exasperation.
- the true intention is to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation, indicating a mismatch between what is said and what is meant.
- this difference is a hallmark of sarcasm.

step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""no true scotsman,"" ""should i even bother""
- the phrase ""no true scotsman"" refers to a classic logical fallacy. the phrase ""should i even bother"" suggests that the speaker feels some level of frustration or resignation.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **no true scotsman**: this logical fallacy is often used humorously or sarcastically to point out flawed arguments.
  - **""should i even bother to mention hovind?""**: this implies that bringing up hovind (likely a known figure associated with controversial or flawed arguments) is so predictable or inevitable that it feels pointless.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely highlighting the futility in arguing against predictable and flawed reasoning. the usage of ""no true scotsman"" and reference to hovind suggest they are preemptively addressing an expected but irrational argument.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment indicates a tone of resignation or frustration, potentially with a hint of mockery.
- the true intention reveals that the speaker is anticipating a predictable and flawed argument, exemplifying it with the ""no true scotsman"" fallacy and reference to hovind.
- the mismatch between the literal meaning (questioning whether to mention hovind) and the true intention (highlighting how predictable and pointless the situation is) suggests a sarcastic undertone.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the over-the-top reference to ""joe the plumber"" and the dramatic exclamation, ""say it aint so!"" suggest an ironic tone. the speaker likely does not truly believe or is disappointed by the abandonment but is using hyperbole to mock the situation.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is likely ridiculing the event or the notion that even someone like ""joe the plumber"" would abandon the project, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation.

comparing the casual, exaggerated language with the intention, it is clear that the tone is mocking and ironic rather than genuinely upset or surprised.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement contains questions and a somewhat perplexed tone. there is an attempt at humor or confusion with references to turkeys and spelling. the use of ""even the yanks"" suggests a casual comparison, and the exclamation ""what has a turkey got to do with the french voting no!"" reveals a sense of bewilderment or disbelief.

### step 2: true intention
the questions and the apparent confusion indicate that the speaker is mocking the idea of turkeys having any relevance to the topic of the french voting no. the rhetorical question ""by the way, why do you spell turkey with a capital t?"" adds to the mockery, suggesting that the speaker finds the whole discussion absurd or irrelevant.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of confusion and bewilderment aligns with the true intention of mocking the irrelevance of turkeys in the context of the french vote. the exaggerated manner and tone suggest a sarcastic approach, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the connection between turkeys and the voting topic.

    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""it's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of"" suggests that the speaker accuses the other person of being deceitful or speaking out of both sides of their mouth, implying insincerity or hypocrisy. the use of ""the facts are the facts"" further suggests that the speaker believes the facts are already evident, and the other person's inconsistency is therefore even more hypocritical.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**:
  - ""that ain't the way it works slick, nice try anyway"": the use of ""slick"" and ""nice try anyway"" hints at a dismissive tone.
  - ""hello simone honey"": this phrase seems affectionate or friendly.
  - ""emoticonxlove"": this emoticon indicates love or affection.

- the sentence seems to have two distinct parts: an initial statement that feels dismissive or critical, followed by a friendly and affectionate closing.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - the phrase ""that ain't the way it works slick, nice try anyway"" suggests an attempt to correct or pointedly criticize someone in a somewhat condescending or sarcastic manner.
  - the affectionate close (""hello simone honey emoticonxlove"") contrasts sharply with the initial dismissive statement, potentially indicating a more sarcastic undercurrent in the first part.

- **deduction**: the initial statement seems to be sarcastically dismissive, implying the person being addressed is mistaken or has made a futile attempt. the affectionate follow-up could either be sincerely changing tone or further emphasizing the sarcasm by stark contrast.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows mixed emotions—dismissive criticism followed by affectionate terms.
- the true intention appears to be correction or criticism delivered in a sarcastic manner.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Response:

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement appears to be relatively neutral, discussing a past action (""it was a troll"") and then mentioning a potential process or future action related to email response and mail lists. there are no overtly emotional or extreme words used.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""it was a troll"" can suggest that the previous actions or statements were intended to provoke or deceive rather than being sincere. the subsequent part about ""activating email response"" and looking at mail lists seems to be straightforward and practical. there is no clear indication of sarcasm through the use of rhetorical devices or language style.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment and true intention appear to align. the statement is discussing technical actions taken regarding emails and responses, and while the initial phrase ""it was a troll"" might imply a recognition of a provoking action, it doesn’t convey sarcasm in the context given.

- the sentence appears to express a combination of disbelief, questioning, and possible sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:

  - **challenging question**: ""where did you get the idea that id theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?"" this question likely implies skepticism about the idea that id theory is unsupported.
  
- **deduction**: the speaker seems to be questioning or mocking the idea that id theory (presumably intelligent design theory) is not based on evidence or testing. the use of phrases that express disbelief and challenging the listener's sources of information points towards skepticism or sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

- **overall tone:** the tone appears to be neutral or positive on the surface.

#### step 2: true intention

- **context analysis:** analyzing the unusual context (feeding, following orders, and not being hit) strongly suggests that the intention is to criticize or mock an idea by presenting it in an exaggerated, absurd manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** while the surface sentiment appears positive or neutral, the rhetorical nature of the statement, with its exaggeration and inappropriate context, reveals underlying criticism or mockery.
- **inference:** the stark contrast between the surface reading and the true intention indicates sarcasm.

the surface sentiment contains a mix of condescension and fake encouragement. phrases like ""with your current attitude and those like you, you will lose again"" indicate criticism. ""hey i love it...keep up the good work"" sounds like fake praise, as it is unlikely the speaker genuinely loves what they criticize. the statement about moving to canada or cuba with ""the majority agree with my beliefs"" suggests pointed advice that is not meant to be taken seriously.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention appears to be ridiculing and dismissing the person's beliefs and behavior. the fake praise and suggestion to move to another country where people might agree with them is a sarcastic way to imply that their beliefs are unwelcome or out of place. the ellipses used after certain points add to the mocking tone, indicating the speaker is not sincere in their statements but is rather deriding the other person.

the language displays disbelief and exaggeration. phrases like ""murder sprees,"" ""waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire,"" and ""innocent bystanders"" are extreme and emotionally charged. this suggests a reaction of incredulity or exasperation.

the speaker seems to be mocking or exaggerating the perceived implications of another person's statements about the police and military. the extremity and hyperbolic nature of the statements imply that the speaker is not genuinely concerned about these events happening, but is ridiculing the notion that such drastic actions are likely or reasonable interpretations of the police and military's intentions.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (ostensible concern about the severe actions of the police and military) and the true intention (mocking or ridiculing of the idea that the police and military would act in such extreme ways). the exaggeration and incredulity suggest that the speaker's real intention is sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

    - the keywords indicate negativity and criticism.
    - the phrases are harsh and dismissive, showing a strong disapproval or disdain.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the statement heavily relies on sarcasm and rhetorical questions. phrases like ""you must have expected,"" ""made no worthy comments,"" and ""please let me know what comments michael moore made that you thought were worthy"" are delivered with implied derision.
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and sardonic tones to mock and criticize.
    - **context:** the intention seems to be ridiculing and dismissing michael moore's comments as worthless, suggesting that he failed to contribute anything valuable to the discussion.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is negative and critical, lined with sarcastic and dismissive comments. the true intention remains consistent with this, confirming the use of sarcasm to express disdain.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated, mocking tone and rhetorical questions indicate sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be negative and conveys frustration or anger. the keyword ""terminal disease"" indicates a severe and tragic situation. the use of ""yeah"" and the emoji "">_>"" add a tone of irony or disdain toward the phrase ""soul mate.""

### step 2: true intention
examining the sentence closely, it is clear that the speaker is criticizing the concept of a ""soul mate"" in a context where such a relationship would lead to immense suffering (watching a child die from a terminal disease). the phrase ""yeah. i'm thinking"" and the sarcastic emoji "">_>"" reveal that the speaker does not genuinely believe in the ""soul mate"" concept under these harsh circumstances and is instead using irony to make a point.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the mismatch between the tragic implication of a child suffering because of a ""soul mate"" and the dismissive, ironic commentary (e.g., ""yeah. i'm thinking... they’re not... at all"") strongly indicates sarcasm. the speaker is mocking the idea that a true ""soul mate"" would result in such dire consequences.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

  - the text features phrases like ""right off i don't know anyone who does believe it"" and ""its all nonsense right down to encoded ammo.""
  - emotional expressions through emojis: ""emoticonxbanghead"" and ""emoticonxkill.""
  - the discussion includes somewhat critical or skeptical remarks about a societal practice (mandatory arming).

- **sentiments:** 
  - the language appears dismissive and skeptical.
  - the mention of ""nonsense"" directly indicates a dismissive standpoint.
  - the use of emojis, especially ones that represent frustration or aggression, further supports a frustrated or ironic sentiment.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices and style:**
  - the passage uses dismissive and skeptical language to criticize the concept of mandatory arming and the idea of encoded ammo.
  - the rhetorical question and ironic tone suggest the speaker does not believe in the ideas being discussed.
  - phrases like ""good idea to"" wrapped in sarcasm imply that the speaker thinks it is actually a bad idea.

- **true meaning:** 
  - the speaker is likely skeptical about the idea of mandatory arming and encoded ammo, mocking these notions rather than supporting them.
  - there is an underlying tone of frustration and irony, as indicated by the chosen emojis and language style.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **comparison:**
  - the surface sentiment of dismissiveness and skepticism aligns with the true intention, which is to mock and criticize the ideas being discussed.
  - the consistent use of ironic and exasperated elements in both the surface sentiment and true intention indicates a sarcastic tone.

  - ""that's deep."" uses a phrase that sounds complimentary on the surface.
  - ""movement is not matter, i will use that the next time i decide to babble."" suggests a dismissive attitude toward the initial statement, implying it doesn't make practical sense and therefore is not of much use.
  - ""are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?"" is a rhetorical question indicating confusion or questioning the logic of the initial statement.
  - ""your funny."" is a misspelled version of ""you're funny,"" potentially showing a lack of seriousness.

- **sentiments:**
  - the first phrase seems positive.
  - the second phrase reads dismissive and sarcastic.
  - the third phrase demonstrates skepticism.
  - the final phrase appears to be a sarcastic compliment.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices and style:**
  - ""that's deep."" can be taken literally as complimentary or sarcastically to suggest the opposite.
  - ""i will use that the next time i decide to babble"" implies that the statement is not useful and is rather nonsense.
  - the rhetorical question ""are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?"" points to ridiculing the concept.
  - ""your funny"" despite the misspelling, is contextually likely intended to sarcastically highlight that the previous notions are laughable.

- **true meaning:**
  - the speaker is likely mocking the initial statement about movement and matter, suggesting it is nonsensical or over-complicated.
  - the tone indicates disbelief and an attempt to ridicule rather than provide genuine commentary or find humor.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:**
  - the initial surface sentiment appears mixed but leans towards dismissive and skeptical.
  - the true intention, uncovered via rhetorical devices, reveals sarcasm directed at the complexity and perceived absurdity of philosophical or scientific musings about movement and matter.

Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement contains strong and aggressive language, with phrases like ""heinrich himmler"" and ""holocaust and genocide"" evoking intense emotional responses due to their historical context. the phrase ""medal of holocaust and genocide"" is shockingly inappropriate and designed to elicit a reaction. the use of ""congratulations"" followed by ""you're now a supporter of hitler"" distorts what normally would be a positive statement into something deeply sinister and offensive. the phrase ""pink panties award"" adds a layer of ridicule and derision, making the entire statement hostile and mocking.

### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language and rhetorical devices, it is clear that the speaker is not genuinely awarding anyone a medal but is using heightened and offensive language to mock and ridicule. the mention of heinrich himmler and nazi ideals in a context that juxtaposes 'support' and 'awards' is used to massively trivialize and outrage. the extreme overstatement and contrast between the serious subject matter (nazis, holocaust) and absurd rewards (medal of holocaust and genocide, pink panties award) suggest deep sarcasm and ridicule.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the apparent surface sentiment, which includes congratulatory phrases and awards, is starkly contrasted by the actual intention, which is to mock and ridicule individuals in an offensive manner. the grotesque trivialization of serious historical atrocities serves to heighten the mockery. this significant mismatch between surface sentiment (positive/commendatory phrasing) and true intention (derisive, inflammatory sarcasm) confirms the sarcastic nature of the text.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""we all know"", ""your buddies the mormons"", ""it's just a matter of time"", ""they've been duped by an invisible man"", ""do the right thing"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: 
  - **hyperbole**: ""we all know when you say 'we' you mean your buddies the mormons and their money"", which exaggerates the influence of mormons and their financial power.
  - **sarcasm/mockery**: ""duped by an invisible man"" implies that believing in god (referred to here as an ""invisible man"") is foolish.
  - **foreboding**: ""it's just a matter of time before people start to wake up"", implying a sense of inevitability and change.

- **language style**: the language style is mocking and condescending, suggesting that the person who believes or votes against the bill has been fooled and is on the wrong side of history.

- **implied meaning**: the speaker implies that those opposing gay rights are misled by religious beliefs and will eventually realize their error. there is an underlying tone of ridicule about the influence of mormon money and religious belief.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment includes strong indications of mockery and sarcasm, as seen in phrases like ""your buddies the mormons"" and ""duped by an invisible man"". the true intention, uncovered through the rhetorical devices and style, is to ridicule and criticize the beliefs and actions of those opposing gay rights.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.

the surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and mocking. phrases like ""those kooks,"" ""obsessing over me,"" and the comparison to ""teeny boppers obsessing and salivating over a backstreet boy"" suggest a condescending tone.

### step 2: true intention
the use of the word ""kooks"" to describe people on iidb, combined with the statement about them ""obsessing"" and comparing them to fans of a boy band, is meant to belittle and ridicule them. the speaker does not seem to believe that these individuals are genuinely important or worth discussing seriously. instead, they're mocking the attention they're purportedly receiving.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

  - sentence 2: ""she's a conservative! i'll bet her upcoming debate with biden will get far more attention than mccain/obama did! i'll sure be watching!"" expresses exaggerated interest and certainty.
  - sentence 3: ""word has it that the moderator is an obama lover."" contains implied bias and potential skepticism about impartiality.
  - sentence 4: ""i'm just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted, personality contests."" downplays the significance of debate performance.
  - sentence 5: ""just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits doesn't mean he/she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions."" indirectly questions the value of debate skills in political leadership.

- **sentiments:**
  - the overall tone includes elements of exaggerated enthusiasm and skepticism, suggesting an underlying ironic sentiment.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices and style:**
  - the exaggerated confidence about the debate gaining more attention than the mccain/obama debate suggests irony, as it's an unlikely event.
  - the phrase ""word has it that the moderator is an obama lover"" implies bias, hinting at skepticism about the fairness of the debate.
  - the surprise expressed at the importance of debate performance suggests the author views the debates as superficial or overrated.
  - the statement that being ""slightly off the mark in wits"" does not preclude good leadership is likely ironic, implying criticism of the subject's intellectual capabilities.

- **true meaning:**
  - the speaker appears to be mocking the political process and the importance placed on debate skills, implying that these debates and the public's interest in them are overvalued and somewhat pointless.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- comparing the surface sentiment to the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the exaggerated expressions and skepticism about the importance of debates, coupled with the ironic undertones, strongly suggest sarcasm.

Steps:

- **keywords:** ""pulling our legs,"" ""simply not true,"" ""truer words were never spoken.""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""pulling our legs"" is a clear indicator of disbelief or jest. phrases like ""simply not true"" and ""truer words were never spoken"" are often used sarcastically to contradict the preceding statement.
- **language style:** the progression of statements leads to a critical deconstruction of the arguments, employing skepticism and irony to counter positions against evolution.

- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""good,"" ""personally club one baby seal,"" ""consume all socialists with fire from his eyes.""
- the sentence appears overly positive initially with repeated ""good"" but then shifts to violent and absurd imagery which is highly negative and extreme.

### step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **exaggeration/hyperbole**: the statement about ron paul clubbing baby seals and consuming socialists with fire from his eyes is clearly exaggerated and not meant to be taken literally.
  - **sarcasm**: the extreme and absurd nature of the statement suggests that the speaker does not actually believe these events will happen and is instead mocking or ridiculing.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely mocking the situation or people mentioned, possibly to highlight a perceived absurdity in political discourse or sensational statements.

### step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment initially appears positive but quickly becomes absurdly negative, indicating strong use of hyperbole.
- the true intention is to mock or ridicule, signifying a mismatch between the literal meaning and the intended meaning.
- this is a clear case of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input: do you know how many osama bin ladens we killed???? emoticonxrolleyes

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""osama bin ladens,"" ""killed,"" ""????"" (indicates strong emotion), ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (indicates exasperation or disbelief).
- the sentence appears to express frustration or disbelief.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **hyperbole**: the phrase ""how many osama bin ladens"" suggests exaggeration since there is only one osama bin laden.
  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows strong emotion and exasperation.
- the true intention is to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation, indicating a mismatch between what is said and what is meant.
- this difference is a hallmark of sarcasm.

no brother...complete control of everything you do by a power structure you'll be powerless to stop. enjoy!

### steps:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""complete control,"" ""power structure,"" ""powerless to stop,"" ""enjoy!""
- the sentiment appears to express a negative outlook on the control by a power structure.
- the word ""enjoy!"" at the end seems contradictory to the negative context, suggesting possible sarcasm.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **irony**: the phrase ""enjoy!"" at the end is ironical because it's unlikely someone would genuinely be happy about being powerless against a controlling power structure.
  - **sarcasm**: the use of ""no brother"" and ""enjoy!"" in this context implies that the speaker is making a sarcastic remark, not genuinely wishing enjoyment.
  
#### step 3: comparison & analysis
- the surface sentiment is negative, expressing concern or dismay about the situation.
- the true intention, however, is to sarcastically highlight the lack of control one would have and mock the idea of ""enjoying"" such a situation.
- this difference between what is said (""enjoy!"") and what is meant indicates sarcasm.

the surface sentiment is dismissive and confrontational, as indicated by phrases such as ""just like i predicted,"" ""you had already made up your mind,"" and ""nice try.""

## step 2: true intention
the speaker's intention is to mock and discredit the other person. the exaggerated certainty (""just like i predicted"" and ""i had you pegged from the get-go"") and the dismissive ""nice try"" indicate that the speaker doesn't believe the other person was sincerely engaging in a discussion but rather sees them as pretending or being deceptive.

## step 3: compare and analyze
the speaker uses dismissive and mocking language to convey that they do not take the other person seriously and see through their perceived deceit. this contradiction between the apparent engagement in dialogue and the outright dismissal and mockery indicates sarcasm.

Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases**: ""congratulations"" and ""you have just accepted"" contribute to an ostensibly positive tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses sarcasm and irony. the phrase ""you have just accepted the 5 primary tenets of fundamentalism"" implies that the acceptance might not be seen as a positive achievement from the speaker's perspective. ""so i guess that makes you a fundamentalist"" traps the subject in an undesirable identity.
- **language style**: the use of ""congratulations"" is sarcastic, implying that becoming a fundamentalist is not something to be proud of.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears positive, but the underlying intention is negative. the congratulation is ironic, and the statement about becoming a fundamentalist is meant to highlight the negative transformation.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

- **emojis/emoticons**: none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: 
  - **dismissal**: the phrase ""serve no purpose other than to detract"" points out that the original post is deemed unhelpful.
  - **criticism**: ""you've done absolutely nothing"" is a strong critique, indicating that the person has failed to achieve their aim.
- **language style**: 
  - **critical and accusatory tone**: the overall tone is critical. the use of phrases like ""serve no purpose"" and ""you've done absolutely nothing"" convey a strong negative judgment.
  - **direct and definitive language**: the statements are made in a definitive manner, which emphasizes the critical viewpoint.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is critical and dismissive, focused on negating the perceived value or effectiveness of the other person's post. the intention behind the statement appears to be to point out the uselessness and inefficacy of the other person's contributions to the discussion.

### label: not sarcastic
the sentiment is straightforwardly critical without employing the irony or mocking tone that typically characterizes sarcasm. the language is direct and accusatory rather than subtly mocking or ironic.

### Example:
Input: do you know how many osama bin ladens we killed???? emoticonxrolleyes

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""osama bin ladens,"" ""killed,"" ""????"" (indicates strong emotion), ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (indicates exasperation or disbelief).
- the sentence appears to express frustration or disbelief.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **hyperbole**: the phrase ""how many osama bin ladens"" suggests exaggeration since there is only one osama bin laden.
  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows strong emotion and exasperation.
- the true intention is to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation, indicating a mismatch between what is said and what is meant.
- this difference is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""definitely flaky,"" ""no evidence,"" ""absolute truth,"" ""delusional,"" ""like cadbury's fruit and nut (but with out the chocolate or raisins)""
- the sentences are laden with negative sentiments, suggesting criticism and disbelief.

### step 2: true intention

  - **simile and sarcasm**: the comparison to cadbury's fruit and nut without the chocolate or raisins implies that the person is lacking essential qualities, using an exaggerated and humorous analogy.
  - **word choice**: ""flaky,"" ""delusional,"" and ""no evidence"" all indicate strong disapproval and mockery.

### Example:
Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears to be critical and negative. phrases like ""god's a real xxx sometimes"" suggest frustration or disdain, while the mention of ""his uber-complex biochemical engineering skills to create the prions responsible for ffi"" points to a negative view of god's actions.
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of ""god's a real xxx sometimes"" and the pointed remark about prions and ffi (a fatal disease) contribute to a tone of cynicism and mockery.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs sarcasm and irony. the praise of ""uber-complex biochemical engineering skills"" is not genuine but rather a sarcastic remark on creating something harmful.
- **language style**: the style is mocking and tongue-in-cheek, hinting that the speaker is making a sarcastic comment about the perceived cruelty or capriciousness of god.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: while the surface sentiment seems to be a mix of criticism and disbelief, the underlying tone is clearly sarcastic. the exaggeration of god's ""skills"" in creating harmful prions points to this sarcasm.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the seemingly serious language and the disparaging content, along with the use of irony, indicates that the statement is sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

the surface sentiment appears to be highly critical and loaded with negative connotations. phrases like ""ripping unborn fetuses"" and ""how dare those kooks"" are emotionally charged and reveal strong disapproval.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence uses hyperbolic and extreme language to mock the idea that reasonable people would support late-term abortions. the follow-up phrase ""how dare those kooks try to defend the rights of the unborn fetus!"" is exaggerated and ironic, implying the speaker believes the notion is absurd.

### step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the combination of exaggerated language and ironic context strongly suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic by ridiculing the idea that anyone would support such an extreme position.

- **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses sarcasm directly by implying that the person cannot achieve prestigious degrees with their alternative explanations, mocking the credibility or validity of their statements.
- **language style**: the phrase ""the truth hurts"" suggests an attempt to counter the recipient's viewpoint with a reality check, followed by a dismissive remark about their qualifications.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""warm and fuzzy,"" ""again""
- **surface sentiment:** the phrase ""warm and fuzzy"" typically refers to feelings of comfort and happiness. ""again"" suggests this is something that was felt before.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the question form combined with potentially insincere positive emotions suggests rhetorical questioning. the tone may imply skepticism or doubt about the genuine felt emotion.
- **language style:** the use of a question and the phrase ""warm and fuzzy"" in a potentially contradictory context indicates possible sarcasm.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** surface sentiment appears to be seeking a positive emotional reaction (""warm and fuzzy""). however, the rhetorical style and questioning nature imply doubt, leading to the true intention likely being sarcastic.
- **inference:** given the context and phrasing, the sentence suggests sarcasm rather than a genuine inquiry about feeling positive emotions again.

        And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the ""TROOTH"" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""sea of montalban's assertions as science,"" ""out of context quotes,"" ""misrepresentations,"" ""won't be discouraged with facts,"" ""reality seems to be irrelevant.""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases indicate skepticism, criticism, and disparagement.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the repetition of ""sea of"" suggests overwhelming and tiresome repetition, indicating frustration. the use of quotation marks around ""trooth"" signals mockery of montalban's claimed understanding. the statement ""won't be discouraged with facts"" implies that montalban is ignoring reality, while ""reality seems to be irrelevant"" underscores the disbelief and disdain.
- **language style:** the tone is clearly satirical and critical, showing contempt and disapproval of montalban's methods and beliefs.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of skepticism and criticism aligns with the true intent of mocking and disparaging montalban.
- keywords and phrases suggest a clear sarcastic undertone through their critical and mocking nature.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""the exact same"", ""makes little sense"", ""completely nonsensical""
- **emphasis**: the capitalization of ""completely"" indicates strong emotion or emphasis.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses sarcasm to mock the notion that current species are identical to those from a period with different oxygen levels. it questions the logic behind this notion by presenting it as absurd.
- **language style**: the use of rhetorical questions (""that makes little sense"", ""where did all of the oxygen go?"") and strong language (""completely nonsensical"") indicates a mocking tone and disbelief in the statement being addressed.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker implies that it is irrational to believe species today are exactly the same as those during periods with high oxygen content and mocks the idea as nonsensical.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is one of disbelief and mockery, as indicated by the use of sarcastic questions and emphasized phrases. the true intention is to discredit and mock the argument that today's species existed unchanged in vastly different environmental conditions.

### Example:
Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention

- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.

- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""sole monopoly on crazy"" contributes to a critical and somewhat insulting tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses sarcasm. the phrase ""don't worry"" is intended to appear reassuring, but when followed by ""everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy,"" it becomes clear that the speaker is sarcastically addressing the issue of 'craziness' by implying both sides are equally crazy.
- **language style**: the style is sarcastic and dismissive, indicating a hidden criticism rather than genuine reassurance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment of a reassuring tone (""don't worry"") contrasts with the true sentiment, which is sarcastic and critical. the reassurance is fake, and the real intention is to mock or belittle.
- **inference**: the disparity between the apparent reassurance and the critical follow-up indicates sarcasm.

you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""deleted,"" ""what was not deleted,"" ""emotional and psychological development,"" ""maturity,"" ""morality,"" ""character,"" ""integrity,"" ""some republicans/conservatives,"" ""emoticonxrolleyes""
- **observations:** the mention of a message being deleted and the repeated emphasis sounds like frustration or criticism. the list of qualities such as ""maturity,"" ""morality,"" ""character,"" and ""integrity"" seems to be ironically aimed at republicans/conservatives, especially with the use of the ""rolleyes"" emoticon, which typically indicates sarcasm or disdain.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of a sarcastic tone is evident in the listing of positive attributes that the writer implies are lacking in the group being criticized. the ""rolleyes"" emoticon strongly suggests a sarcastic dismissal of the listed qualities.
- **language style:** the language and use of an emoticon denote a mocking or sarcastic approach, emphasizing the contrast between what is stated and what is meant.
- **context:** the speaker positions themselves against a group, criticizing them under the guise of listing qualities they believe the group lacks.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the sentiment seems like a critique framed in a list of positive attributes. the true intention, however, is to mock these supposed attributes, implying the opposite about the group in question.
- **inference:** given the use of the ""rolleyes"" emoticon and the sarcastic tone, it is clear that the statement is not genuinely praising the group but rather mocking them.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

   * **clues:** the phrases ""interesting...."", ""i think the 'taunts' are more directed at gays"", and ""boo hoo"" imply skepticism, confrontation, and mockery.
   * **sentiments:** the phrases exhibit dismissive and confrontational tones. the phrase ""boo hoo"" is a sarcastic way of trivializing the subject's feelings.

### step 2: true intention deduction
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of confrontation and mockery (e.g., quoting ""taunts"" and using terms like ""boo hoo"") suggests the speaker is not seriously discussing the issue but rather undermining and belittling the other party's complaints.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is mocking and dismissing the subject’s concerns about negativity towards the rights of a minority, indicating a strong sarcastic undertone.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
   by comparing the dismissive and confrontational language on the surface with the mocking true intention, it is evident the speaker's statements are intended to be ironic and sarcastic.

"I guess I am just ""psychologically conditioned"" to be blue eyed.?",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment of the statement appears skeptical and somewhat defensive. keywords like ""i guess"" and the quotation marks around ""psychologically conditioned"" suggest a mocking or questioning tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of quotation marks around ""psychologically conditioned"" indicates a sarcastic tone. it implies that the speaker does not genuinely believe in or is ridiculing the idea of being ""psychologically conditioned.""
- **language style**: the sentence employs a questioning style to imply disbelief or sarcasm regarding the idea that one could be ""psychologically conditioned"" to have blue eyes.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment of skepticism and the use of quotation marks to mock the concept indicate sarcasm. the speaker is likely ridiculing the idea with an ironic statement.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""oops, my bad"" initially appears apologetic but is quickly followed by ""you're right of course"", which is a setup for the sarcastic twist. the statement ""it's also a harbour, so you're wrong too!"" is a playful contradiction.
- **language style**: the phrases and the winking tongue-out emoji suggest a playful and teasing tone rather than a serious one.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""sounds like someone could be lying"" implies suspicion or doubt.
- **emoji:** emoticonxic is likely representing a face with a smirk or wittiness, reinforcing the playful or doubtful tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of ""hmmm who could it be?"" employs a rhetorical question indicating that the answer is obvious or the speaker is making fun of the situation.
- **context analysis:** the sentence seems to imply doubt about the honesty of a person in a playful or mocking way.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment suggests suspicion or doubt. however, the playful use of a rhetorical question and the smirking emoji (emoticonxic) indicates an underlying tone of irony or sarcasm.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment (doubt) and the true intention (irony or sarcasm) confirms that the sentence is meant to be sarcastic.

- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment might seem like a genuine inquiry, but the use of phrases combined with the rolleyes emoji strongly indicate mockery or sarcasm.
- **inference:** the surface clues and the rhetorical style used indicate that the statement is sarcastic.

### step 3:
the initial dismissive statement contrasted with the factual and neutral subsequent explanation suggests the speaker may be trying to correct the other person while simultaneously hinting that their initial understanding was incorrect or naive.

the surface sentiment appears to be incredulous and questioning. the use of questions like ""not a belief, not a faith at all?"" and the implied skepticism in ""it is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using god to fill gaps?"" indicates doubt.

### step 2:
the rhetorical device in play here seems to be sarcasm. the speaker's phrasing suggests they find the idea of theistic evolution being ""not a belief"" or ""not a faith at all"" to be absurd. the follow-up question implying it's ""just a humanistic idea"" seems to mock the premise by reducing it to a simplistic and dismissive explanation.

### step 3:
the apparent contradiction between the questioning tone (implying disbelief) and the reductionist explanation indicates that the speaker is being sarcastic. the use of rhetorical questions further supports this.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears to question the success of the eu and liberalism negatively. however, the rhetorical question and mocking tone reveal the true intention is to criticize the notion that the eu is a failure and that liberalism creates misery.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be confrontational, driven by phrases like ""is your thinking really this simplistic?"", ""is that all the complexity you can handle?"", ""what a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.""

### step 2: true intention
the rhetorical questions and exaggerated statements suggest the speaker is mocking or ridiculing the idea that complex issues can be viewed in a very black-and-white perspective. the speaker is clearly frustrated and is using sarcasm to emphasize the absurdity of the simplistic thinking they are arguing against.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the contradiction between the confrontational tone and the exaggerated sentiments indicates that the speaker is being sarcastic. the mocking tone and rhetorical questions are classic signs of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement employs a dismissive and judgmental tone. phrases like ""in denial about how he feels about gays"" and ""equating tolerance for gays with tolerance for murderers"" suggest an accusation of hypocrisy or misguided beliefs. the final phrase ""now i know how you think, thanks!"" has a tone of feigned gratitude or realization.

**step 2: true intention**
the language style is heavily ironic and accusatory. the speaker is not genuinely thankful or interested in understanding the other person's perspective. instead, they are using sarcasm to highlight what they perceive as the absurdity or offensiveness of the other's views. the intention is to mock or belittle the other person's stance on tolerance for lgbtq+ individuals by comparing it to an extreme scenario (murderers).

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
the surface sentiment is critical and accusatory, underlined with a tone that suggests frustration and irony. the true intention, as revealed by the rhetorical devices, shows the speaker is ridiculing the other person's position through exaggerated comparison. this mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention confirms the use of sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""pulling our legs"" is a clear indicator of disbelief or jest. phrases like ""simply not true"" and ""truer words were never spoken"" are often used sarcastically to contradict the preceding statement.
- **language style:** the progression of statements leads to a critical deconstruction of the arguments, employing skepticism and irony to counter positions against evolution.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""kudos on getting the quotes right"", ""much appreciated"", ""what's your actual assertion"", ""spell it out"", ""definition debate in context"", ""actually get somewhere"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: none.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""kudos on getting the quotes right! it's much appreciated"" could potentially be sincere, but within the context of requesting clarification, it could also imply a slight jab at the person’s previous statements, hinting they haven't been clear. the follow-up ""now, what's your actual assertion?"" and ""if you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context"" suggests the speaker is somewhat frustrated by the lack of clarity and wants to move the conversation forward.
- **language style**: there is a mix of formal and informal language with an initial compliment that turns into a request for clarity. the expression ""maybe actually get somewhere"" implies a degree of dissatisfaction or impatience with the current progress.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment begins with what appears to be a compliment, but shifts towards seeking clarity in the debate. the true intention seems to reflect an impatient or slightly frustrated attempt to have a more productive discussion. 

while the text could be interpreted as slightly sarcastic due to the juxtaposition of the compliment and subsequent request for clarity, it doesn’t overtly contain enough clear sarcasm markers (such as hyperbole, irony, or exaggerated insincerity) that are typical in strongly sarcastic comments.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""if you want the analogy, ya gotta live with where it bites ya"" implies a conditional acceptance of something along with its negative consequences. the use of ""bites ya"" can be seen as informal and possibly indicating irritation or a warning about negative outcomes. the positive emoticon at the end can be interpreted as adding a layer of irony or sarcasm.
- **language style:** informal, possibly attempting to use humor or irony by juxtaposing a negative consequence with a traditionally positive visual cue (like an emoticon).

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment has mixed signals where ""bites ya"" suggests negativity but the emoticon suggests positivity.
- the true intention seems to convey sarcasm, as the speaker acknowledges the downside of an analogy while ironically pairing it with a positive emoticon.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

- **clues:**
  - terms like ""neanderthals"" which is a derogatory term referring to primitive or uncultured people.
  - ""had the social graces"" implies a minimum level of politeness and manners.
  - ""know what to do with toilet paper"" refers to a basic social skill that should be universally known.

- **sentiments:** the language is clearly demeaning and derisive. the use of the terms ""neanderthals"" and ""social graces"" is sarcastic as it implies that the person being spoken about lacks basic social skills.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices and style:**
  - the statement contains irony and sarcasm. the speaker does not genuinely mean to compliment the social graces of the person they’re addressing; instead, they are implying the opposite.
  - the exaggerated insult ""neanderthals"" criticizes the addressee's sophistication and intelligence.

- **true meaning:** the speaker is mocking the person they address, implying that they are uncivilized and lack basic understanding of social norms and hygiene. the tone is scornful and ironical.

- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of words like ""truly is sad"" and contrasting an opponent being ""friendlier"" than an ally can signify a deeper frustration.
- **context analysis:** the comparison between an opponent and an ally typically implies irony because an ally is expected to be friendly and supportive. this indicates criticism towards the ally (mega).

### step 3: comparison and analysis

you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""terminate tissue he isn't carrying,"" ""opt out,"" ""responsible just like the mother.""
- the keywords suggest discussions around responsibilities, biological roles, and legal obligations.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrasing ""first of all"" sets a corrective and somewhat authoritative tone. the phrase ""terminate tissue he isn't carrying"" emphasizes the biological disadvantage of men in this situation.
- **language style:** the tone is direct and explanatory, aiming to clarify misconceptions.
- **context:** the statement is about clarifying the roles and responsibilities of a father versus a mother in the context of childbirth and parental responsibilities.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement is about biological realities and responsibilities. the true intention appears to be delivering a factual argument rather than employing humor, exaggeration, or mockery.
- **inference:** the tone is corrective and educational but not mocking or exaggerated, which are key indicators of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

**clues:**
- the phrase ""interestingly everyone but 'the left' can assimilate what is being said"" implies a contrast and criticism towards 'the left'.
- the term ""notorious"" used to describe 'the left' carries a negative connotation, indicating a bias.
- the statement ""the left is notorious for their ever-present attitude that everyone else is mindless"" employs hyperbole, suggesting an exaggerated view.
- the phrase ""you don't got no brownie points"" adds to the critical tone, possibly hinting at frustration or sarcasm.

**sentiments:**
the overall sentiment appears critical and dismissive towards 'the left'. there's a tone of frustration and condescension throughout the statement.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices and style:** 
  - the use of ""interestingly"" sets a sarcastic tone right from the start.
  - the hyperbolic ""notorious"" and ""ever-present attitude"" amplify the critical stance against 'the left'.
  - the colloquial ""you don't got no brownie points"" is a dismissive remark, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

- **true meaning:** the speaker is likely using sarcasm to criticize 'the left', implying they are unable to understand common knowledge or logic and are unjustly condescending toward others. the use of ""brownie points"" in a dismissive manner indicates sarcasm rather than genuine critique.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment analysis reveals a critical and dismissive tone.
- the true intention deduction affirms that the speaker’s use of exaggerated language and dismissiveness points towards sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""mindless robot"" is used metaphorically to imply a lack of personal agency and autonomy, suggesting that heaven, as described, is undesirable.

        ","### step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""over generalization,"" ""unjust stereotyping,"" ""lies,"" ""misinformation,"" ""muddying the waters,"" ""jaaaman""
- the repetition of ""can you say"" followed by strong phrases suggests criticism or protest.

### step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **repetition**: the repetitive question ""can you say"" emphasizes criticism.
  - **capitalization**: use of uppercase letters for keywords emphasizes the strong disapproval and frustration of the speaker towards these concepts.
  - **irony**: the speaker asks rhetorically if you can say these negative phrases, which suggests that these are not just words but reflect real concerns or issues they believe are present.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely criticizing the prevalence of over-generalization, stereotyping, lying, misinformation, and muddying the truth. the sarcastic tone implies that the speaker finds these actions obvious and common.

### step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment reveals strong emotions and a critical stance.
- the true intention behind the message is to criticize and condemn specific behaviors in a sarcastic manner.
- the disjunction between the literal repetition and the underlying criticism illustrates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

step-by-step explanation:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""anything to get around doing things the normative way"" suggests a deviation from the standard or expected method.
- **emoji:** emoticonxdonno conveys ambivalence or indifference, potentially highlighting a dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""anything to get around"" implies a criticism or disapproval of avoiding conventional methods. the use of ""the normative way"" enhances the perception of deviation being frowned upon.
- **context analysis:** the sentence implies that there is a preference for not following the normative way, hinting at a sarcastic critique of non-conformity or laziness.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears to discuss an alternative to the normative method without positive or negative connotations directly. however, the rhetorical style (implying avoiding the normative way is undesirable) and the emoji suggest a critique.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""",1

### step 3: compare and analyze

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

comparing the surface sentiment and true intention confirms that the speaker’s remarks and use of the rolleyes emoticon carry a mocking and derisive tone. the rhetorical devices and language style strongly indicate that the speaker is not genuinely engaging with the argument but is instead mocking it.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

- **context analysis:** taken together, the phrases indicate a strong disapproval and mockery of the person's knowledge or competence in the subject mentioned.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears to be harsh criticism. however, the use of ""einstein"" in a sarcastic manner makes the true intention derisive and mocking.

""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.

    - the smiley emoji "":)"" often adds a contrasting tone, potentially lightening the statement on the surface but can also indicate sarcasm.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the language is apparently dismissive or belittling, suggesting the speaker thinks lowly of the addressee's abilities.
    - **language style:** the statement uses a mocking tone, masked by the emoji which may make it seem superficially light-hearted but actually reinforces the dismissiveness.
    - **context:** the intention appears to imply that the speaker actually believes the addressee lacks the intellectual and logical ability to respond effectively, despite their attempt.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the sentiment is negative and dismissive, compounded by a smiley emoji which, rather than lightening the statement, underscores a mocking tone.
    - **inference:** the contrasting combination of a derogatory statement with a smiley emoji strongly suggests sarcasm.

- **emojis/emoticons**: none.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement appears to use hyperbole and absurdity, suggesting that changing the numbering system for grasshoppers having 4 legs is an exaggerated and nonsensical requirement. this hyperbole indicates that the speaker does not seriously believe such a change is necessary.
- **language style**: the phrase ""you forgot to mention"" positions the statement as an overlooked point, but the absurdity of the ensuing claim implies a mocking tone.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is mocking the idea being discussed, implying that it is as ridiculous as suggesting a change to the numbering system based on grasshoppers' legs. this exaggeration serves to ridicule the original suggestion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment suggests an overlooked point, while the true intention reveals hyperbolic ridicule meant to mock the suggestion. the use of absurdity and exaggeration implies a sarcastic tone.

Input:

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

   * **sentiments:** the statement appears to mix strong disapproval with a dismissive or mocking tone towards the idea that someone might feel ""not accommodated.""

### step 2: true intention deduction
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the exaggerated claim equating polygamy and marriages with minors and livestock is likely an attempt to mock or criticize the idea that certain groups feel marginalized or ""not accommodated."" the use of scare quotes around ""accommodated"" further implies a lack of genuine concern for those who feel this way.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is being sarcastic about the concept of feeling ""not accommodated."" they are expressing disapproval of polygamy, underage marriages, and marriages to livestock, while also mocking the idea that some people feel left out or unacknowledged.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
   comparing the apparent surface sentiment (disapproving and dismissive) with the true intention (mocking and sarcastic), it is clear that the speaker is not genuinely concerned about the issue of accommodation. instead, the statement is intended to be ironically dismissive.

#### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
**clues:**
- phrases like ""if you aren't smart enough"" and ""you're hopeless"" are directly critical and insulting.
- the rhetorical questions ""do you not understand the meaning of your?"" and ""do you not understand the meaning of the word top?"" convey frustration and are belittling.

**sentiments:**
- the language is harsh, critical, and condescending. there is a clear negative tone, suggesting the speaker is frustrated or mocking the listener's understanding.

#### step 2: true intention deduction
**rhetorical devices and style:**
- the use of conditional ""if you aren't smart enough"" implies that the speaker does not actually believe the listener lacks intelligence, but is instead expressing frustration.
- the rhetorical questions further imply that the speaker is annoyed and finds it obvious what they meant, suggesting an intent to mock the listener.
- the exaggerated negativity (""you're hopeless"") and the repeated questioning of basic terms the speaker assumes should be understood indicate a sarcastic tone.

**true meaning:**
- the speaker's true intention is likely to mock and belittle the listener, insinuating that the questions being asked are so basic that failure to understand them is a sign of incompetence.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is negative and critical.
- the true intention reveals a mocking and sarcastic attitude due to the rhetorical and exaggerated language.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the statement contains a hint of frustration and condescension. the phrase ""exactly, because it's not just an issue of 'her body'"" implies a counter-argument, while ""thanks for missing the point."" is a sarcastic remark indicating annoyance or disappointment.

### step 2: true intention
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's evident that the speaker is not genuinely thanking the other person. the phrase ""thanks for missing the point"" is sarcastic, suggesting that the other person has indeed missed the point of the argument about smokers affecting other people. the exaggerated nature of the ""thanks"" indicates the speaker feels the other person is oblivious or not understanding.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment of 'thanking' and the actual intention of expressing frustration or annoyance. the use of ""thanks"" in a context where the speaker is actually criticizing the other person for not understanding the argument signifies sarcasm.

- **emojis/emoticons**: none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the final question ""will we never think above a 1st grade level?"" implies a criticism of the thought process being discussed.
- **language style**: the statement contrasts two sides of a thought process—one patriotic, the other disdainful of fundamental values. the final rhetorical question implies a criticism of the perceived simplicity or naivete of the thought process.
- **implied meaning**: there appears to be an implied criticism of how the subject is being approached, suggesting that the conversation or argument is overly simplistic or naive. 

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment involves a comparison of thought processes regarding wars and patriotism. the true intention, however, appears in the rhetorical question which implies that the situation or argument is being viewed in a simplistic manner, akin to the understanding of a 1st grader. this introduces a layer of mockery or criticism.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

- the phrase ""didn't jesus say to turn the other cheek?"" invokes religious teaching and suggests that people should show patience or tolerance.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""ah yes, the ever popular"" introduces sarcasm, and the labeling of the response as ""3rd grade"" indicates derision. the rhetorical question about jesus turning the other cheek highlights the contrast between childish behavior and religious moral guidance.

    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""multiply your experience,"" ""50 million non-paying,"" ""12 million illegal people,"" ""tell me how happy they'd be to serve you.""
- **sentimental phrases:** ""how happy they'd be to serve you.""
- the keywords and phrases suggest a focus on large numbers of non-paying and illegal people. the phrase ""tell me how happy they'd be to serve you"" implies dissatisfaction or unlikelihood.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""multiply your experience"" is rhetorical, suggesting a hypothetical situation. the use of large numbers (""50 million,"" ""12 million"") serves to exaggerate the situation.
- **language style:** the tone is critical and hyperbolic. the sentiment is one of disbelief or sarcasm, especially the phrase ""how happy they'd be to serve you,"" which implies the opposite.
- **context:** the intention appears to criticize or mock the idea that such a large number of non-paying and illegal people would be happy to serve anyone.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement seems to discuss a situation involving large numbers of non-paying and illegal people. the true intention, however, is to criticize or mock their willingness to serve, implying it's unrealistic and thus sarcastic.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""but?"" ""if?"" ""isn't?"" ""but that's?"" ""must be a progressive prison or something.""
- **sentimental phrases:** questions raised with fragmented sentences suggest a level of skepticism or mock wonderment. the phrase ""must be a progressive prison or something"" suggests a critical viewpoint.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of fragmented questions ""but?"" ""if?"" ""isn't?"" typically hints at rhetorical questioning, often used in sarcasm to dismiss or undermine a preceding statement or idea. 
- **language style:** the fragmented nature of the sentences and the final exclamation ""must be a progressive prison or something"" imply a sarcastic tone, likely mocking the idea being referenced.

- **keywords:** ""oh, i see,"" ""anything for my old pal ez!""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases generally convey a sense of willingness and friendliness.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""oh, i see"" can indicate a hint of realization, possibly feigned. ""anything for my old pal ez!"" could be an exaggerated expression of camaraderie, suggesting it might not be genuine.
- **language style:** the language suggests an over-the-top friendliness that might not be sincere, indicating possible sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears friendly and willing, but the exaggerated nature of the statement and the context (potentially feeling compelled to post more) hint at a sarcastic undertone.
- the keywords and phrases display typical sarcastic language when seen in a context of someone feeling obliged, rather than genuinely enthusiastic.

"Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the statement includes phrases like ""plain with the benefit of hindsight,"" ""i love how you're able to determine,"" and ""if it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, i'm sure."" these phrases suggest skepticism, disbelief, and a dismissive tone.

### step 2: true intention
the use of phrases like ""i love how you're able to determine"" and ""if it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, i'm sure"" indicates sarcasm. the speaker is obviously doubting the other person's ability to correctly understand the situation and is mocking their certainty.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment appears to be one of skepticism and dismissal, which lines up with the true intention of mocking the other person's confidence. the speaker's use of sarcasm is evident through their exaggerated praise and ironic statements.

""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

- clues: the phrase ""i'll let you know if or when i'm ignoring you"" signals a dismissive or aloof response.
- sentimental phrases: ""o hell-bound spawn of satan"" is hyperbolic and heavily charged, indicating disdain.
- overall sentiment: the statement is laced with contempt and antagonism, initially coming across as confrontational.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole (""o hell-bound spawn of satan"") and the conditional (""if or when"") are key rhetorical devices.
- language style: the combination of grandiose insults and conditional timing reflects irony and sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not literally intend to notify the person about ignoring them, nor mean the exaggerated insult in a literal sense; it serves instead to mock and belittle the individual.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: while the surface sentiment is deeply antagonistic, the exaggerated language and conditional statement hint at underlying sarcasm.

Steps:

- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""mr. unrepentant homosexual"" appears confrontational and may carry a sarcastic tone. ""never said i had it mastered"" conveys a defensive tone, suggesting the speaker is responding to criticism.
- **language style**: there appears to be a contrast between the defensive ""never said i had it mastered"" and the somewhat didactic ""love does speak the truth.""
- **implied meaning**: the speaker seems to be addressing someone with a tone that's possibly sarcastic, particularly by using ""mr. unrepentant homosexual,"" which might be used sarcastically to belittle or mock the addressed person.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is somewhat ambiguous, with a mix of defensive and possibly confrontational tones. the true intention, indicated by the rhetoric and language style, leans more towards sarcasm due to the phrasing and confrontational undertone in replying to the person in question.

- the keywords and phrases indicate a rather crude, blunt, and somewhat biological discussion of human conception and life's varied potential.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of crude imagery (maxi pad, box of kleenex, rudely flushed out) juxtaposed with serious philosophical questions about the value of life suggests a deliberate contrast. 
- **language style:** the language style is provocative and somewhat mocking of deeply philosophical or sentimental discussions about when life should be valued.
- **context:** the intention appears to challenge or criticize the idea that all potential human life should be equally valued, using exaggerated and crude examples to spotlight perceived inconsistencies in this belief.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement seems to evaluate the concept of 'life' and 'value' in a straightforward, albeit crude, manner. the true intention, however, appears critical and dismissive of the consistent valuation of all life forms.
- **inference:** the use of crude language mixed with serious philosophical questioning, and the exaggerated nature of the examples, suggest a strong element of sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""how mature,"" ""all caps screaming,"" ""namecalling,"" ""it's no surprise,"" ""you don't,"" ""emoticonxrolleyes""
- **sentimental clues:** the use of phrases like ""how mature"" and ""all caps screaming and namecalling"" is critical and dismissive. the ""emoticonxrolleyes"" suggests frustration or disdain.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** sarcasm is evident in phrases like ""how mature"" and mentions of ""all caps screaming and namecalling,"" which are used to mock the immaturity of the behavior described.
- **language style:** the language is condescending and belittling, indicating a lack of genuine respect for the person being addressed.
- **context:** the statement criticizes someone for immature behavior (screaming, namecalling) and lack of substantiation (not defending their view), mocking their approach to argumentation.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement appears critical and dismissive. the true intention reinforces this sentiment through mockery and sarcasm.
- **inference:** the critical and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical devices used, strongly suggests that the statement is sarcastic.

Input:
and sotomayor argued that the american people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. what's your point?

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

### reasoning:

step 1: the surface sentiment seems somewhat positive due to the phrase ""on the bright side,"" but contains a contradictory element as it is discussing a catastrophic event (the rapture) solving a financial issue.

step 2: the true intention is to highlight the absurdity of considering the rapture, an apocalyptic event, as a ""solution"" to any problem, which is inherently illogical and highlights the speaker’s ironic tone.

step 3: the contrast between a catastrophic event and solving a mundane financial issue, alongside the use of ""on the bright side,"" indicates a sarcastic remark aimed at mocking the idea that such a serious event could be seen as beneficial in any context.",1

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

  - ""how about not clicking the 'reply' button twice (heh,heh,)"": the use of ""heh,heh"" suggests a mocking tone.
  - ""no, we didn't (thank goodness)"": indicates relief and possibly sarcasm.
  - ""pm blair is recanting from the kyoto protocol. bully for him!"": ""bully for him"" is an expression that can be sarcastic, meaning ""good for him"" in an insincere way.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: 
  - the phrase “how about not clicking the 'reply' button twice (heh,heh,)” uses mockery.
  - the use of ""thank goodness"" implies relief but could also be sarcastic.
  - ""bully for him!"" is likely used sarcastically since it is known as an idiomatic expression often used to mock or show insincere approval.

- **language style**:
  - informal and mocking, indicating sarcasm and disdain.
  - the statement is structured to mock actions and decisions in a dismissive manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: 
  - the surface sentiment includes keywords and phrases that indicate a mocking and sarcastic tone.

""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""a real simple yes. do i win something?"" could be taken at face value as a direct question, but it also has a tone of incredulity or rhetorical questioning.
- sentimental phrases: the addition of ""do i win something?"" suggests a sense of incredulity or disbelief.
- emojis: the use of ""emoticonxsmilie"" may suggest a playful or mocking tone set by emojis.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the question ""do i win something?"" is a rhetorical question often used to indicate that the action (in this case, agreeing with ""yes."") was very simple and required no special effort. 
- language style: the use of the phrase ""a real simple yes"" indicates that the speaker finds the question to be trivial or the answer to be obvious.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not expect to win anything and is instead pointing out the simplicity of the question or the obviousness of the answer.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment seems to be playful or incredulous, which leads to the true intention of subtly mocking the simplicity or obviousness of the question.
- inference: the true intention suggests sarcasm as the speaker is likely mocking the nature of the question or the expected answer.

- **emojis/emoticons**: none present.
- **sentiment**: there's an initial factual statement and a contrast between self and other: ""i provided evidence"" versus implying the other did not offer substantial counterargument. the phrase ""oh no it isn't!"" introduces a contrast and could imply disagreement or dismissal.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: 
  - **proverb**: ""you can take a horse to water"" is often used to imply that you cannot force someone to accept or understand something if they are not willing.
  - **contrast**: the speaker sets up a comparison between their own rational behavior (""i provided evidence"") and the perceived irrational response of the other (""you provided ............"").
  - **exclamation**: ""oh no it isn't!"" suggests a dramatic rebuttal likely intended sarcastically, indicating disbelief or mockery.
- **language style**: the sequence of the statements coupled with an abrupt exclamation at the end indicates the speaker's sarcasm and dismissal of the other person's stance.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker believes they have presented a rational argument, whereas the other party has offered an inadequate rebuttal, which is mockingly dismissed.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment carries a tone of reasonable assertion (""i provided evidence""), while the true intention, revealed by rhetorical contrast and the dismissive phrase ""oh no it isn't!"", exposes underlying sarcasm directed towards the other person's lack of substantial argument.

Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement contains a mix of informative and pointed critique tones. it begins with discussion about scientific theories such as gravity, heliocentric theory, atomic theory, and the germ theory of disease, presenting a factual standpoint. however, it shifts to a dismissive and confrontational tone with phrases like ""mangling of the 'out of africa' theory"" and ""babble such nonsense,"" which indicate frustration and dissatisfaction with the other person's understanding.

### step 2: true intention
the true intention becomes evident through the use of dismissive language and the stark contrast between the informative tone and the aggressive conclusion. the statement's latter part implicitly criticizes the listener for lacking knowledge and trivializes their arguments by calling them ""nonsense."" the initial seemingly calm and informative discourse builds up to a ridiculing dismissal, suggesting the speaker is belittling the opposing viewpoint.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment shows a mix of factual (non-sarcastic) presentation of scientific theories and a shift to aggressive criticism (potentially sarcastic). the true intention includes the use of rhetorical devices like sarcasm to undermine the opponent's credibility. the transition from educational to accusatory language indicates sarcastic undertones meant to mock or belittle the listener’s knowledge.

- **context analysis:** the speaker is criticizing the person's behavior in various threads and implying that their bad mood is unjustified and affecting their interactions with others negatively. the addition of ""lol"" further indicates a sarcastic tone, trying to belittle the person's seriousness.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** while the surface sentiment is aggressive and confrontational, the true intention behind the exaggerated and mocking language confirms the use of sarcasm.
- **inference:** the consistent use of mocking and belittling language, alongside the presence of rhetorical sarcasm, confirms that the overall passage is sarcastic.

the surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and mocking. this is indicated by the use of ""yeah, because"" and the exclamation mark at the end, which commonly denote a sarcastic tone.

### step 2:
the true intention becomes clearer with further analysis. the phrase ""has no bearing on reality as far as crime and safety goes!"" is sarcastic. it implies that the speaker actually believes the brady ratings and approval of gun laws do have significance regarding crime and safety. the following phrase ""which is nato's real point!"" reinforces the sarcastic nature by emphasizing an obvious point that is being ridiculed.

### step 3:
there is a stark contrast between the surface sentiment and the underlying meaning. the dismissive and mocking tone contrasts with the literal statement, indicating sarcasm. the speaker is mocking the notion that brady ratings are meaningless by overstating this idea in a sarcastic way.

### Example:
Input: do you know how many osama bin ladens we killed???? emoticonxrolleyes

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""osama bin ladens,"" ""killed,"" ""????"" (indicates strong emotion), ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (indicates exasperation or disbelief).
- the sentence appears to express frustration or disbelief.

step 2: **true intention**
- **rhetorical devices & language style**:
  - **hyperbole**: the phrase ""how many osama bin ladens"" suggests exaggeration since there is only one osama bin laden.
  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows strong emotion and exasperation.
- the true intention is to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation, indicating a mismatch between what is said and what is meant.
- this difference is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* the use of ""generic"" and ""reading the bible thing"" indicates a somewhat dismissive or belittling tone towards standard religious responses.
* **sentiments:** the second sentence, ""does he literally talk to you?"" reinforces the skeptical tone. the choice of the word ""literally"" suggests a challenge to the listener to provide an answer that is more concrete or extraordinary.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the question is framed in a way that casts doubt on the conventional answers, implying they are insufficient or unsatisfactory. it uses a rhetorical question with a slightly mocking undertone.

- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment is critical and belittling. phrases like ""just a dupe,"" ""information comes from a moonie,"" and ""made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook"" suggest a condescending tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""just a dupe,"" ""your information comes from a moonie,"" and ""made up his mind that it was wrong"" contribute to a mocking and dismissive tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: 
  - **sarcasm**: phrases like ""just a dupe rather than being dishonest"" and ""funny that the discovery institute doesn't mention that"" employ sarcastic language to mock the person and highlight their perceived ignorance.
  - **irony**: the statement about studying biology to disprove evolution before understanding it is presented ironically to underline the supposed foolishness.
- **language style**: the language is sarcastic, sharp, and aims to ridicule the subject's knowledge and motivations.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment is disparaging and the true intention is equally sarcastic, designed to ridicule the reliability and credibility of the person’s sources and motivations.
- **inference**: the consistent mocking and sarcastic tone across the phrases and rhetorical devices indicate a strong element of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""

- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i was under the impression"" indicates prior belief or knowledge.
- **neutral keywords:** ""referencing the video"", ""embryo"", ""fetus"". the phrases ""has instructions for a brain"" and ""depends on the ever-evolving definition of 'mental existence'"" seem factual or explanatory in nature.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i was under the impression"" might have a hint of skepticism, but it mainly serves to introduce a factual correction or clarification.
- **context analysis:** the speaker is discussing specific terms and their meanings in the context of a debate. the second part of the input aims to differentiate between an embryo and a plant based on mental existence.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment appears neutral to corrective. there isn't a marked discrepancy.
- **inference:** there are no clear markers of sarcasm like irony, exaggerated sentiment, or context that implies anything other than what is directly stated.

3101 posts! what a waste of cyber real estate! at least you are brief.,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

3101 posts! what a waste of cyber real estate! at least you are brief.

### response:

### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
* **clues:**
  * exclamation marks indicate strong emotions or emphasis.
  * the phrase ""what a waste of cyber real estate!"" conveys a negative sentiment about the value of the 3101 posts.
  * ""at least you are brief"" appears to be a compliment but stands in stark contrast to the previous statement, suggesting irony.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:**
  * the statement is rife with irony. ""3101 posts"" and ""what a waste"" suggest that the speaker views the content as excessive or not valuable.
  * pairing this with ""at least you are brief"" is contradictory, as 3101 posts are not brief, indicating sarcasm.
* **true meaning:**
  * the speaker does not genuinely mean that 3101 posts are a waste of cyber real estate. it's an exaggerated way to mock the quantity and perceived quality of the posts.
  * ""at least you are brief"" is intended ironically since the sheer number of posts implies the opposite.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
* **surface sentiment:** negative and critical.
* **true intention:** mocking the excessive number of posts and the idea of brevity in an ironic way.

How is one supposed to be smugly self-righteous if this is the case? No fair.,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

- clues: phrases like ""smugly self-righteous"" and ""no fair.""
- sentimental phrases: ""smugly self-righteous"" is a loaded phrase often used critically; ""no fair"" sounds childishly indignant.
- overall sentiment: the statement seems critical of self-righteousness, but the use of ""no fair"" lessens the seriousness, suggesting a playful or mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the question ""how is one supposed to be smugly self-righteous if this is the case?"" employs irony, implying the opposite of the literal meaning—that it is undesirable to be self-righteous.
- language style: the informal and somewhat childish phrase ""no fair"" suggests mockery rather than genuine complaint.
- underlying message: the speaker doesn't genuinely believe it's unfair to be prevented from being smugly self-righteous; rather, they are mocking the idea itself.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: while the surface sentiment hints at criticism and indignation, the choice of words and overall tone signal irony and mockery.
- inference: the statement is intended to mock the concept of being self-righteous, not to argue seriously against fairness.

surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the expression ""sez-you..."" is dismissive, suggesting the speaker does not take the previous statement seriously. the phrase ""and i thought you didn't know what you were talking about"" uses irony to imply the opposite of what is stated, indicating that the speaker actually believes the listener does not know what they are talking about, reinforcing the mocking nature.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.

- **keywords:** ""i guess,"" ""a readers digest,"" ""sure,"" ""zombie ant making mold""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases suggest a playful, mocking tone, often used synonymously with sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of exaggerated hypotheticals (""take 'in god we trust' off our money,"" ""swear on a readers digest,"" ""time for converting to another religion"") implies ridicule rather than genuine questions. the progression leads to increasingly absurd scenarios suggesting disbelief in the necessity or seriousness of these changes.
- **language style:** the statements employ hyperbole and rhetorical questions to mock potential changes driven by the separation of church and state or adopting unconventional worldviews.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment:** slightly dramatic and contains ridicule.
- **true intention:** the use of hyperbolic scenarios and rhetorical questions creates a mocking tone, reflecting sarcasm.

- **context analysis:** the context involves a controversial subject (creationism) that is commonly debated. such absolute language might imply exaggeration or mockery of the process of thoroughly investigating and debunking creationism.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment is a straightforward factual statement. however, the absolute and hyperbolic nature of the phrasing can imply sarcasm, especially considering the ongoing debate around creationism.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: the word ""absurd"" suggests a strong negative sentiment towards galileo's action or statement.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the use of the word ""absurd"" in conjunction with galileo, who is historically recognized as a figure of significant scientific contribution, suggests an ironic tone.
- language style: the statement uses understatement, as referring to an action by galileo as ""absurd"" is contrary to the general acclaim and respect he receives. this implies the speaker does not intend to genuinely label galileo's logic as absurd.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment appears to be critical of galileo, but the exaggerated nature of calling one of his logical leaps ""absurd"" suggests that the speaker is using irony.

""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

No, people arn't looking for healthy, white infants, they are looking for infants. This automatically reduces 90% of adoption cases. The so called ""Healthy white infants"" make up 70% of all adoption cases, seeing that 30% of abortion are done by blacks, and latinos and most minorities don't have abortions, but instead keep their children.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
* **clues:** phrases like “so we kill the baby instead?” and “interesting idea.” indicate skepticism and passive criticism. use of the word “interesting” can be ironic here. detailed breakdown of foster and adoption care statistics suggests a well-informed perspective, but the tone remains confrontational.
* **sentiments:** the overall sentiment is critical and confrontational, with the potential for irony or sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the opening question “so we kill the baby instead?” already sets up a dramatic irony, implying the speaker finds the alternative concept morally unacceptable. the phrase “interesting idea.” further suggests disapproval rather than genuine interest. detailed statistics are used to support the argument about the adoption system rather than to engage in a factual discussion.
* **true meaning:** the speaker is arguing against the idea of aborting babies by highlighting the potential for reforming the foster and adoption care system instead. the rhetorical questions and the tone imply a sarcastic disbelief in the original suggestion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of skepticism and irony matches the true intention of criticizing and dismissing the concept of aborting babies. the phraseology and rhetoric confirm an underlying sarcasm.

Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

### Example:
Input:

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention

- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

   * **sentiments:** the language used here seems to imply a concern for safety and security, highlighting an unpleasant and alarming situation.

### step 2: true intention deduction
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the phrase ""frequently broken into, in the broad daylight"" is an exaggeration, suggesting that such break-ins happen often and without any fear from criminals. this heavy irony and extremity indicate a skeptical and critical stance, probably pointing out the ineffectiveness of security measures.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely criticizing the lack of security in the apartments, and the ""frequently broken into"" further amplifies the mockery. the exaggeration about criminals not being harmed signals the underlying criticism of weak security systems or law enforcement.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

well, merkel is a way better looking guy than schroeder , thats for sure !
but schroeder is the king of hair dyes....i will get my advise from the best.

### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears positive albeit with a slightly humorous undertone. compliments such as ""better looking"" and ""king of hair dyes"" seem positive on the surface.
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""way better looking"" and ""king of hair dyes"" aim to set a complimentary tone at first glance.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statements employ irony and hyperbole. by calling merkel a ""better looking guy"" and schroeder the ""king of hair dyes,"" the language suggests an exaggeration that undercuts the apparent praise.
- **language style**: the humorous exaggeration and contrast suggest that the speaker does not genuinely believe merkel is ""a way better looking guy"" than schroeder. similarly, ""king of hair dyes"" seems sarcastic given the context.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: although the surface sentiments appear positive, the true intention reveals exaggeration and a mocking tone, making the overall sentiment sarcastic.
- **inference**: the mismatch between apparent compliments and the exaggerated language establishes the sarcastic nature of the statement.

### Example:
Input:
""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**

Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

### step 2: true intention
the phrase ""if truth makes you uncomfortable, feel free not to respond to me"" suggests the speaker is challenging the listener's discomfort with honest discourse. the speaker also states an intention to highlight and ridicule hypocrisy and bigotry, emphasizing that they will mock anyone who downplays the severity of slavery. this shows a genuine commitment to addressing these issues.

Because he thinks we think like him, where if the Creation myth in Genesis falls, then all of religion and morality fall with it. Or in our case, all of secularism and immorality fall with the CD of MB. Because thinking the way scientists or non-Creationists Christians do is incomprehensible and evil, and what else is there?

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
the surface sentiment here appears to be dismissive and mocking. there are phrases like ""declare victory,"" ""evo dogma dethroned!!!,"" ""that's the end of it,"" and ""thinking the way scientists or non-creationists christians do is incomprehensible and evil,"" which carry a sarcastic and dismissive tone.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the writer uses exaggerated language and mocking phrases to ridicule the idea that a single sentence out of a publication can completely discredit a scientific theory. as shown in ""declare victory,"" and ""evo dogma dethroned!!!,"" the writer is mocking the simplistic and exaggerated way of arguing against evolution.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
both the surface sentiment and true meaning reveal a strong use of sarcasm. the writer is not seriously considering the claim that the central dogma of molecular biology is outdated or that this single point somehow invalidates all of evolutionary theory.

### Example:
Input:
""i wasn't aware that the candidates were the ones allowed to ask the debate questions. emoticonxconfused""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

by investigating the language style and rhetorical devices, it becomes evident that the speaker is not sincerely acknowledging the other person's point. instead, the phrase ""one is bad advice; the other is one of your posts."" implies a negative judgment beneath the surface. the wink emoji ""😉"" typically denotes sarcasm or a joke, further underscoring this.

the message seems to argue against someone's stance by highlighting perceived hypocrisy (""you become what you hate""). the use of sarcasm is evidenced by the choice of words and the mocking of someone's alleged avoidance and inconsistent behavior. the rhetorical device of pointing out a contradiction in the subject's actions further supports this.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

the statement begins with an emphatic ""wow!"" followed by a dramatic ellipsis indicating possible surprise or disbelief. the phrase ""if your interpretation were correct"" introduces a hypothetical scenario, which is quickly dismissed by the follow-up ""but it's not, and there isn't.""

### step 2: true intention
the speaker's true intention is to refute the idea presented. the emphatic ""wow!"" and the hypothetical scenario that is immediately negated imply a sense of mockery or disbelief towards the initial statement. the use of a dramatic ellipsis and the strong dismissal suggest that the speaker does not take the initial interpretation seriously and is mocking its validity.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment suggests surprise or disbelief, while the true intention reveals mockery and dismissal of the initial statement. the exaggerated manner and tone, especially with the use of ""wow!"" and the hypothetical scenario, indicate sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **emojis/emoticons**: none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the term ""safety nazis"" is a hyperbolic and derogatory term used to express disdain for overly strict or controlling safety regulations. the comparison of gun-free zones to prisons is a metaphor meant to criticize the concept.
- **language style**: the language is heavily sarcastic and critical. the use of rhetorical questions (""how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?"") suggests disbelief and derision regarding the effectiveness of gun-free zones.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment seems negative and critical, particularly towards over-regulation and the effectiveness of gun-free zones. the true intention, revealed through hyperbolic terms (""safety nazis""), metaphors, and rhetorical questions, is to sarcastically mock and criticize the concept of gun-free zones.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the statement contains an accusatory tone and a critical sentiment. phrases like ""all christians have some sort of brain damage"" suggest a generalization and an offensive claim. additionally, the question ""you're not getting any better at this, are you?"" indicates sarcasm or a lack of respect.

### step 2: true intention
the exaggerated generalization and the rhetorical question suggest that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe that all christians have brain damage but is instead using hyperbole to criticize or mock the person being addressed, trebor. the phrase ""you're not getting any better at this, are you?"" further emphasizes a dismissive or belittling attitude.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.

the sentiment appears highly critical and frustrated. the phrases ""irrelevant to the point"", ""are the gun grabbers really dense"", and ""does this maniac think to himself"" convey a strong sense of disdain, irritation, and mockery towards those who support restrictive gun laws.

### step 2: true intention
analyzing the rhetoric, it's clear that the author is not making a genuine inquiry but rather using sarcasm to ridicule the idea that obtaining a concealed handgun license would prevent a maniac from going on a killing spree. the exaggerated scenario and rhetorical questions serve to ridicule the notion of a license being a meaningful obstacle.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a stark difference between the surface sentiment (irritation) and the true intention (mockery and ridicule). the exaggerated and rhetorical questions indicate that the author is being sarcastic about the effectiveness of gun control measures in preventing violent individuals from acting on their impulses.

- **keywords:** ""spread god's love ...right?""
- **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""spread god's love"" in the context of questioning, and the phrase ""debate like an adult"" suggests a critical sentiment toward the person being described.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ellipses and ""right?"" indicates skepticism and likely sarcasm. the question implies disbelief that the person is spreading love, as the earlier part of the sentence suggests they are not behaving like an adult.
- **language style:** the questioning tone combined with criticism points towards an intention of mocking or criticizing the person’s behavior.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows a critical tone.
- the true intention, revealed through the skeptical questioning and rhetorical devices, aligns with sarcastic language meant to criticize or mock the subject's behavior.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.

- the phrase ""mountains to other gay rights supporters"" implies significant challenges.
- the phrase ""just mole hills to you"" implies these challenges are perceived as minor by the addressed person.
- the use of ""mole hills"" compared to ""mountains"" suggests a downplaying or minimization of the issues.
- the emoji ""emoticonxhoho"" adds a mocking or dismissive tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of the contrast between ""mountains"" and ""mole hills"" is metaphorical, indicating a major difference in perception of the issues between the two groups.
- **language style:** there is a minimizing and possibly mocking tone toward the addressed individual’s perception of the challenges faced by gay rights supporters.
- **context:** the intention seems to be to criticize or mock the addressed person's downplaying or trivialization of challenges significant to others.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment implies a trivialization of issues perceived as major by others. the true intention, through the use of metaphors and a dismissive tone, suggests a sarcastic attitude.

### Example:
Input:
""i wasn't aware that the candidates were the ones allowed to ask the debate questions. emoticonxconfused""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

- **emojis:** the smiley face at the end suggests a light, possibly teasing tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrases ""won the 'most posts per day' award"" and ""can you say 'obsessed'? i knew that you could :)"" suggest irony. the use of quotation marks around ""most posts per day"" award and ""obsessed"" hints at sarcasm. the final sentence ""i knew that you could :)"" has a patronizing tone, further solidifying the sarcastic intent.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment might appear to be simply stating a fact about the poster's activity. however, the use of specific phrasing and punctuation (e.g., quotation marks) and the smiley suggest a mocking, sarcastic tone.

And I made your ignore list?
Finally! I am getting somewhere!",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **clues:** 
  * the phrase ""as far as insults go, this one makes no sense"" suggests frustration or dismissal of the insult.
  * the phrase ""except in your little mind"" is derogatory and dismissive.
  * the sentence ""and i made your ignore list?"" indicates some level of mock surprise or fake concern.
  * the sentence ""finally! i am getting somewhere!"" is celebratory but could be easily interpreted as ironic given the previous context.

* **sentiments:** the language is dismissive, derogatory, and the concluding exclamation ""finally! i am getting somewhere!"" suggests irony given the negative context.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** 
  * the use of dismissive and derogatory language (""little mind"") indicates the speaker is not genuinely praising or seeking approval.
  * the phrase ""finally! i am getting somewhere!"" is likely used ironically, contrasting the negative sentiment expressed earlier.
  * the rhetorical question ""and i made your ignore list?"" adds to the mocking tone.

* **true meaning:** the speaker is using irony and disdain to mock the person who insulted them. they are not genuinely happy about being on an ignore list nor are they genuinely concerned or offended.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment (mock frustration and dismissal) and the true intention (irony and mockery), it is evident that the speaker is using sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the initial phrase ""how gracious of you"" can have a dual meaning, with context determining its sentiment. it can be genuine gratitude or sarcasm. the follow-up sentences introduce a tense debate-like tone, emphasizing ""i have not asked you,"" ""assume any morality,"" and ""implying circularity is merely the excuse you've chosen,"" which suggest defense and accusation.

### step 2: true intention
the overall structure and phrasing suggest that the speaker's intention is to mock the recipient. ""how gracious of you"" is used sarcastically here, as it precedes a critique and accusation. the speaker implies that the recipient is using weak or circular arguments, which doesn't align with genuine graciousness.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment has hints of sarcasm (""how gracious of you"") combined with defensive and critical undertones in the subsequent sentences. comparing this to the true intention, where the speaker is clearly ridiculing the recipient's arguments, reinforces the presence of sarcasm.

- **emojis:** the winking emoji "";)"" suggests a playful or not entirely serious tone.
- the choice of the word ""terrorist"" in the context of god indicates a potentially provocative or contentious statement.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""he must be a terrorist"" followed by a winking emoji suggests this is not a literal statement but rather an attempt at humor or sarcasm.
- **language style:** the language shifts from a potentially provocative statement about god and terrorism to a more serious and straightforward admission of lack of knowledge about terrorists (""seriously i really don't know much about terrorists"").
- **context:** the segue from a controversial statement to a serious one indicates the initial statement was likely a setup for a sarcastic or humorous effect.

#### step 3: compare and analyze

  - surface sentiment: the initial statement appears provocative and contentious but the emoji indicates it should not be taken entirely seriously.
  - true intention: the true intention is humorous or sarcastic, especially given the abrupt shift to serious language.

  - **emoji**: emoticonxsmilie, which suggests an attempt to be light-hearted or to skirt a heavy topic with humor.

- **true intention**:
  - **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses sarcasm to mock the effectiveness of gun control. phrases like “maybe the american criminals will just import guns” and “net results, zilch, nada, zero” convey skepticism in a roundabout way, suggesting a lack of belief in the proposed measures.
  - **language style**: the sarcastic tone is evident in the hyperbole and the exaggeration of outcomes, making it clear that the speaker questions the efficacy of gun control seriously but expresses it mockingly.
  - **implied meaning**: the speaker is sarcastically suggesting that gun control won't work because criminals will always find ways around it and that those promoting it are either naive or misleading.

**comparison and analysis**:
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention**: while the surface sentiment includes phrases that could be taken literally, the over-the-top and hyperbolic nature reveals a sarcastic tone. the true intention underneath is to deride the idea of gun control, consistent with a sarcastic delivery.",1

- **context:** the intention appears to be pointing out someone's inability to understand a point, despite the speaker's efforts.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment could be seen as neutral or slightly exasperated, but the true intention reveals a mocking and skeptical tone.
- **inference:** the combination of rhetorical devices and the mocking undertone strongly indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **sentiments:** the overall statements appear dismissive and mocking, giving a serious issue a sarcastically absurd solution.

- **clues:** 
  - the mention of ""stalin"" and ""the ussr"" typically introduces a historical and political context.
  - comparing ""god"" to ""dictators"" and labeling dictators' ""apologists"" implies a critical stance.
  - describing apologists with the phrase ""apologists such as yourself"" suggests a personal and accusatory tone.

### step 2: true intention deduction
- **rhetorical devices and style:**
  - the use of historical figures and concepts like stalin and the ussr to make broader philosophical comparisons is a strong rhetorical device.
  - the comparison of god to dictators uses hyperbole to emphasize the restrictive nature attributed to both.
  - the personal accusation ""apologists such as yourself"" strongly suggests a negative judgment towards the person being addressed, indicating a mocking or critical tone.
  
### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment involves a mixture of historical criticism and personal accusation.
- the true intention reveals the statement is not literal but rather using exaggerated comparison to criticize the addressed person by equating religious belief with totalitarianism.
- the exaggerated comparisons and accusatory tone suggest the speaker is not being literal but rather sarcastic.

- **sentimental phrases**: the use of ""sheesh!"" and the quotation marks around ""yearning"" for democracy suggest disbelief or mockery. additionally, the statement about saddam being a ""toady"" and the use of ""hmmmmmm"" also add to the skeptical and dismissive tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the passage employs irony and sarcasm, especially through the exaggerated expression of ""goodwill"" and ""yearning"" for democracy, which implies the opposite. the historical reference to saddam and the bush administration's past actions serves to highlight a perceived hypocrisy or contradiction.
- **language style**: the style is sarcastic and critical, signaling disbelief and disdain for the notion being discussed.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

  - ""what an arsehole lol"" clearly indicates a derogatory sentiment, softened somewhat by ""lol"" to imply jest.
  
### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:**
  - the question ""i was right wasnt i?"" is rhetorical and implies that the speaker believes they were correct, likely about an insult or negative trait.
  - mentioning ""sesame street"" in relation to looking up ""zombie"" is infantilizing and meant to mock or insult.
  - the use of ""arsehole"" reinforces a strong negative sentiment.
  - including ""lol"" usually indicates the speaker is trying to be humorous or sarcastic.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:**
  - the surface sentiment is negative, with mockery and insult present.
  - the true intention behind using rhetorical questions and references to children’s media complicates the analysis. it is meant to mock and belittle the subject in a manner that a reader can infer as not being straightforwardly derogatory but sarcastically so.

Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement uses a mix of sarcastic and serious tones. phrases like ""yeah, those teabaggers are sooo racist. :)"" and ""you're just as bad as marieantoinette"" suggest sarcasm through exaggeration and mockery. the emoji "":)"" reinforces this sentiment. the later part, ""i, for one, am happy to see that there are plenty of people who aren't too mesmerized by the nation's first black president to think for themselves. you are not one of them,"" uses a serious tone and expresses personal opinions about political views.

### step 2: true intention
examining the language style and rhetorical devices, the initial segment appears to mock the notion that tea party members are racist by exaggerating the claim (""sooo racist"") and using a sarcastic smiley face. this sentiment continues with the marie antoinette comparison, implying that those who label tea party activists as racist or traitors are making extreme and unfounded accusations. the later part clarifies that the speaker believes not everyone blindly follows obama and accuses the addressed person of being one of the blind followers.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the initial mockery and exaggerated statements indicate sarcasm, as the speaker ridicules the idea that all critics of obama are racist and equates them to a historical figure famous for ignorance and insensitivity. the latter part of the text transitions to a more earnest expression of political views.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""religion is not a topic for science classes"", ""teach the science"", ""if that presents a problem for your religion"", ""think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically"", ""cast doubt on well established scientific theory"", ""pretend that magic is a viable alternative"".

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: 
  - imperative (""teach the science in class""): directs an action.
  - suggestion (""perhaps you should think""): advises reconsideration of beliefs.
  - contrast (""pretend that magic is a viable alternative""): differentiates scientific theory from religious belief by implying the latter is not credible.
- **language style**: 
  - the statement adopts a rational and explanatory tone until the phrase ""pretend that magic"", which conveys a dismissive and sarcastic view of presenting religious beliefs as equivalent to scientific theories.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: 
  - the surface sentiment seems to be instructive and critical towards mixing religion with science.
  - the true intention includes a mocking tone towards the idea of presenting religious beliefs as comparable to established science, especially highlighted by the term ""pretend that magic"".

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement ""gooey cute as this reads"" appears to have a light-hearted, somewhat dismissive tone with the use of ""gooey cute"". the following question, ""how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" shifts to a more serious, questioning tone about relevance.

### step 2: true intention
the juxtaposition of the phrase ""gooey cute"" with a serious question about relevance suggests a contrast meant to highlight the perceived triviality or inappropriateness of the previous statement in a philosophical context. this indicates a rhetorical device typically used in sarcasm, suggesting the speaker is mocking or criticizing the previous statement for being too frivolous for the discussion.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment combines a dismissive and questioning tone, while the true intention appears to mock the trivial nature of the prior statement in a serious discussion. the exaggerated contrast between ""gooey cute"" and ""relevant to the philosophy discourse"" suggests clear sarcasm.

"Oh my goodness, yes. I had forgotten that scenario. How silly of me.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the phrase ""oh my goodness, yes. i had forgotten that scenario. how silly of me."" contains expressions that appear to be polite and self-reflective. the use of ""oh my goodness"" and ""yes"" imply acknowledgment. the phrase ""how silly of me"" appears to suggest self-deprecation.

### step 2: true intention
the exaggerated acknowledgment (""oh my goodness, yes."") combined with the self-deprecation (""how silly of me"") suggests that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe what they are saying. the rhetorical device used here is likely sarcasm, where the speaker pretends to accept fault or express forgetfulness but actually means the opposite.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there's a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (polite acknowledgment and self-deprecation) and the true intention (sarcasm). the exaggerated politeness and self-critique suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic, likely making fun of the idea of having forgotten the scenario.

### Example:
Input:
""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears to be a mix of mock praise and skepticism. phrases like ""bravo...well done"" combined with ""excuse me"" and emojis like ""emoticonxgood"" and ""emoticonxembarrassed"" suggest a sarcastic undertone rather than genuine admiration or concern.
- **sentimental phrases**: ""is this satire? if so...bravo...well done"" and ""if you are really serious...ummmm...excuse me"" convey disbelief and mock approval. the use of ""emoticonxgood"" and ""emoticonxembarrassed"" further enforces this mixture of mock praise and slight embarrassment.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of questioning (""is this satire?"") implies that the speaker finds the statement or idea being referenced hard to believe. the phrases ""bravo...well done"" paired with the skepticism reinforces the irony. the transition from possible satire to ""if you are really serious"" suggests that if the subject is indeed serious, the sentiment changes to embarrassment or disbelief.
- **language style**: the style is playful and mockingly polite, implying that the speaker does not actually believe the subject's statement is worthy of genuine praise, and is instead ridiculing it.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: both the surface and true sentiment suggest a mix of mock praise and skepticism. the positive words and emojis are contradicted by the skeptical questioning and phrases that imply disbelief or derision.
- **inference**: the message appears to juxtapose praise with skepticism, highlighting an underlying irony and sarcasm.

"Yet, you want interference by forcing the schools to teach religion in science class.
How ironic.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:** ""forcing the schools,"" ""teach religion in science class,"" ""how ironic.""
- the keywords imply coercion (""forcing"") and an unusual juxtaposition of subjects (religion in science class).
- the phrase ""how ironic"" suggests a sense of contradiction or unexpected outcome.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""how ironic"" serves as a signal of sarcasm; it indicates the speaker finds the situation incongruous.
- **language style:** the statement uses a critical tone, likely intending to mock or question the logic behind the idea.
- **context:** the intention appears to highlight the perceived absurdity or hypocrisy of advocating for religious teachings in a scientific educational context.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, the statement simply describes a scenario and labels it ""ironic."" the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, employing irony to underscore a perceived contradiction in the proposition.
- **inference:** the sarcastic tone, particularly the explicit use of ""how ironic,"" strongly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **emojis/emoticons**: :p (indicates playfulness or mockery).

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of quotation marks around ""learnt"" suggests a degree of mockery or disbelief. starting with ""alrighty then..."" indicates an exaggerated acceptance or agreement, which is commonly used in a sarcastic context.
- **language style**: the use of informal language and a playful emoticon, combined with the exaggerated phrasing and mockery of ""learnt"", suggests the speaker is not sincere.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't genuinely believe they need to learn how to spell and is likely responding to a criticism or correction in a mocking manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment of the statement appears provocative and critical. phrases like ""wait till the blastocyst is definitely a tumour"" and ""in case it turns into a fetus"" suggest a somewhat confrontational tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: the terms ""blastocyst,"" ""tumour,"" and ""fetus"" are used in a provocative manner to scrutinize the logic or stance on a controversial topic regarding developmental biology and potential ethical implications.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence employs sarcasm and rhetorical questioning. the comparison between a ""blastocyst"" and a ""tumour"" versus a ""fetus"" creates an exaggerated scenario that likely aims to criticize or question an opposing viewpoint.
- **language style**: the language is sharply critical and implies disbelief or disapproval of the idea being addressed. the use of a rhetorical question underscores the attempt to mock or refute a particular stance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears critical and confrontational, while the true intention, revealed through sarcasm and rhetorical questioning, is to mock an opposing viewpoint on a sensitive issue.

the surface sentiment appears to be cynical and mocking. phrases like ""please be sure to give that message to all the criminals out there"" and the rhetorical question ""we wouldn't like to have the situation where all the law abiding citizens got rid of their guns and the criminals kept them, would we?"" suggest pessimism and skepticism.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the true intention seems to be criticizing the idea of disarming law-abiding citizens. the rhetorical structure and the sarcastic tone of ""we wouldn't like to have..."" indicate that the speaker is not genuinely concerned about communicating with criminals but is instead highlighting what they perceive as the flaws in the argument for stronger gun control.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the usage of rhetorical questions and the mocking tone align both the surface sentiment and the true intention, suggesting the speaker is being sarcastic about the notion of disarming law-abiding citizens while implying criminals would remain armed.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears neutral and factual. the phrase ""i must admit"" tends to convey honesty or concession, while ""never tried to gain access to swords"" seems straightforward and unemotional. 

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of the word ""possibly"" at the beginning introduces some ambiguity or irony. the phrase ""i never tried to gain access to swords whilst over there"" is unusual and could be seen as overly specific, indicating some level of irony or sarcasm.
- **language style**: the language seems formal and the specificity of ""swords"" in the context might hint at an unexpected or humorous contrast.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: on the surface, the statement is neutral, but the specific and unusual mention of ""gaining access to swords"" injects a level of absurdity or irony.
- **inference**: the juxtaposition of formality with an unexpected subject suggests that the speaker might be making a humorous or sarcastic comment rather than a sincere one.

Steps:
step 1: **surface sentiment**
- **keywords & sentimental phrases**: ""osama bin ladens,"" ""killed,"" ""????"" (indicates strong emotion), ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (indicates exasperation or disbelief).
- the sentence appears to express frustration or disbelief.

  - **emoticonxrolleyes**: this emoticon typically signals sarcasm, skepticism, or irritation.
- **deduction**: the speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of repeatedly claiming to have killed the same individual.

step 3: **comparison & analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows strong emotion and exasperation.
- the true intention is to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation, indicating a mismatch between what is said and what is meant.

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**

- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

You have a lot of screwball theories that you will be taking to Hell with you when you die.,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
* **keywords and phrases:** ""screwball theories,"" ""hell,"" ""when you die""
* **sentiments:** the phraseology suggests strong negative sentiment. ""screwball theories"" implies that the theories are ludicrous or nonsensical. the reference to ""hell"" and ""when you die"" is harsh and carries a menacing tone.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** the message uses hyperbolic language (""screwball theories"") and extreme imagery (""hell,"" ""when you die""). the combination of these elements generally implies disbelief mixed with insult rather than a literal description.
* **true meaning:** the speaker likely does not believe the theories have any merit and is expressing contempt through an exaggerated and dramatic statement.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment is harshly negative, and the true intention is to mock and insult the theories and the person who believes them. the exaggerated and dramatic language suggests that the speaker does not seriously think the person will literally take their theories to hell, but instead, they are using hyperbole to ridicule.

the surface sentiment appears to be heavily sarcastic and disdainful. clues indicating this sentiment include the use of ""roflmao!"" (a term often used in an exaggerated manner to show ridicule), multiple ""emoticonxrolleyes"" (rolling eyes emoticon, suggesting dismissiveness or disbelief), and phrases that mock the subject such as ""i know it must be incredibly tough to read anything when you have a job"" and the capitalization of phrases to emphasize frustration and ridicule.

### step 2: true intention
the structure and language indicate the speaker is mocking the lack of understanding and effort by those who oppose a legislation without having read it. the repeated ""emoticonxrolleyes"" suggests the speaker finds the situation absurd. the capitalization of ""to know exactly"" and ""to have any knowledge"" emphasizes the speaker’s frustration and disbelief that someone would praise a politician for calling another a liar without knowing the facts. the term ""roflmao"" further reinforces this sarcastic tone.

Steps:

- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

### step 2: true intention
by examining the language style and rhetorical devices, it becomes evident that the speaker is not genuinely inquiring about giving up consumer goods or reducing the population for unemployment reasons. instead, sarcastic questions like ""so...are you offering to give up your computer and the electricity that runs it?"" ridicule the feasibility and logic behind the initial gripe. the extreme suggestions (""ban from civilization,"" ""cull the population"") underscore this mocking intention.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxbye (typically implies dismissal or finality with a touch of sarcasm).

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: there is condescension (""don't be more stupid than you need to""), combined with a defense framing (""i did not misquote the author""), criticism (""his point was not only incorrect but patronising too""), and sarcasm related to book selling and understanding (""not a good thing if you want to sell a book"", ""not that you would understand"").
- **language style**: the language style is critical, condescending, and dismissive, with a clear aim to belittle.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker is emphasizing that the other person is both unintelligent and lacks the capacity to understand or appreciate the nuances of the author's work. the emoticon suggests a dismissive tone, reinforcing the sarcastic intent.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: both the surface sentiment and the true intention reveal a strong undercurrent of sarcasm. the phrase ""don't be more stupid than you need to"" is inherently sarcastic, as it downplays the other’s intelligence while pretending to offer advice. the closing remark ""not that you would understand"" reinforces this tone.

### Example:
Input:
""i wasn't aware that the candidates were the ones allowed to ask the debate questions. emoticonxconfused""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""

- **emoji:** none present.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the use of ""o.k. lets' play your game"" followed by a challenging question is an example of a rhetorical device. the sentence is structured to question the effectiveness of gun control in a confrontational manner. the capitalization of ""where"" emphasizes doubt or disbelief, suggesting that it's a rhetorical question to which the speaker believes the answer is 'nowhere'.
- **context analysis:** the tone and structure imply sarcasm, as the speaker is likely pointing out that gun control (according to them) has not worked effectively anywhere.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**

- **keywords:** ""far worse,"" ""humbug!,"" ""believe you are in a majority""
- **sentimental phrases:** ""far worse"" indicates strong negative sentiment toward the notion presented in the first sentence. ""humbug!"" is an exclamation of disbelief or dismissal, and ""you only say that because"" suggests an accusatory tone or intent to refute.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""far worse"" is hyperbolic, contrasting two scenarios. ""humbug!"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm or disbelief. the phrase ""you only say that because you believe you are in a majority"" implies skepticism about the sincerity of the argument for equal rights, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.
- **language style:** the statement uses exaggerated comparisons and dismissive expressions, which are common in sarcastic rhetoric.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows strong negative and dismissive tones with keywords and phrases that signal disbelief and contradiction.
- the true intention employs rhetorical devices consistent with sarcasm to criticize or mock the original statement about government and liberties.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

* **clues:** uses phrases such as ""you are ok with"" and an argumentative stance about sensitive topics like abortion, involving ""a woman deciding what is right for someone else's own body"" contrasts with ""the babies"". the structure involves questioning the qualifications and perspectives of women vs. men on the issue.
* **sentiments:** the language appears emotionally charged and filled with rhetorical questions aimed at challenging common societal views, implying a confrontational tone.

### step 2: true intention deduction
* **rhetorical devices and style:** utilizing phrases like ""seems to me"" and ""in fact, it could be said"" follows a pattern often used in arguments to present a controversial opinion. the argument that the man has ""the only independent perspective"" is particularly inflammatory and seems designed to provoke.
* **true meaning:** the speaker appears to be questioning the validity of a woman's perspective on abortion in a manner that implies disbelief or skepticism towards commonly held views supporting women's bodily autonomy. the manner of argument seems to mock the quality or importance of these perspectives sarcastically.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
* comparing the surface sentiment (emotionally charged, confrontational tone) with the true intention (skeptical, mocking the perspective that supports women's autonomy in abortion issues), it is clear that the speaker is using sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

the statement presents strong evidence against a particular claim, mentioning ""evidence is totally against that,"" ""infant mortality,"" and ""lack of resources."" the final clause, ""but hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you,"" introduces a contradictory sentiment with an informal and dismissive tone.

### step 2: true intention
by including rhetorical devices such as sarcasm with phrases like ""but hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you,"" the intention is to mock or belittle the stance opposing the evidence provided. the use of ""but hey"" signals an ironic shift, highlighting the absurdity of ignoring clear evidence and common sense.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
there is a clear mismatch between the surface sentiment (highlighting crucial issues like evidence and infant mortality) and the true intention (mocking the disregard for such significant issues). the sarcastic remark at the end is designed to ridicule the opposing viewpoint drastically.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**

- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- clues: the phrase ""i guess you never thought"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""should they ask them to take their lives?"" is an extreme and emotionally charged statement.
- overall sentiment: the statement seems to criticize the audience for their perceived lack of understanding or empathy, using exaggerated and emotionally charged language.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses sarcasm (""i guess you never thought"") and hyperbole (""ask them to take their lives?"").
- language style: the phrasing is pointed and accusatory, hinting at irony and sarcasm, especially with the use of the extreme scenario.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not believe that the audience genuinely thinks about the implications of their beliefs regarding catholics and gay family members; instead, they are drawing attention to what they see as an inconsiderate or hypocritical stance.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the surface sentiment appears to scold or challenge the audience's viewpoint, but the exaggerated and emotionally charged language suggests that the statement is not entirely serious.
- inference: the true intention is likely to mock or criticize the audience's perceived attitudes towards gays in catholic families.

### Example:
Input:
and sotomayor argued that the american people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. what's your point?

Steps:
step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and confrontational due to the phrase ""what's your point?""

step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
the apparent contradiction between the exaggerated claim and the dismissive follow-up suggests the speaker is being sarcastic by mocking the idea that sotomayor's argument is so extreme.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
the sentence discusses the acceptance of equal rights for gay citizens under the constitution and the implication for bans on gay marriage. the language used is formal and reasoned, talking about constitutional rights and implications without any obvious sentimental phrases or keywords suggestive of sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
the sentence appears to present a logical argument. it states that if one accepts a principle (equal rights for gay citizens), then one must logically accept its consequence (bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional). there are no rhetorical devices, exaggerations, or language styles that would indicate the speaker is not serious about this argument.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
the surface sentiment is formal and reasoned, which matches the serious and logical argument presented in the true intention. there is no indication of sarcasm in the sentence.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement contains multiple elements that suggest frustration and disdain. phrases like ""there ya go again"" and ""you can't refute my argument so you resort to insulting me"" imply criticism and contempt. the use of ""emoticonxfrazzled"" and ""emoticonxgood"" further adds an element of affected indignation and sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the speaker appears to be mocking the other person's inability to engage in a civil debate and their consistent behavior of resorting to insults. the supposedly polite acknowledgment (""thanks for being so consistent"") is delivered in a context that implies frustration and contempt rather than genuine appreciation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
evaluating both the surface sentiment and the true intention, there is a clear mismatch between the seemingly polite phrases and the underlying frustration and mockery. the use of rhetorical devices like sarcasm (""thanks for being so consistent"") and the context provided by the emojis suggest a sarcastic tone intended to ridicule the other person's behavior.

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the sentence uses a condescending and sarcastic tone. the suggestion to improve skills to a ""grade 6 level"" blatantly implies that the person is perceived as lacking even basic competence, which is a form of mockery. 
- **context analysis:** the speaker is not genuinely offering advice but is instead mocking the other person's abilities in a patronizing manner.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
   * **clues:** 
     * the statement ""that's a good point"" is typically used to agree with someone's point.
     * the phrase ""we need to outlaw miscarriage"" is an exaggerated assertion considering miscarriages are natural and often unavoidable.
     * the statement ""women knew the risk of miscarriage when they had sex"" is a hyperbolic and unreasonable claim given that miscarriage risk is mostly uncontrollable and unpredictable.
   * **sentiments:** the overall phrasing is highly charged and seems to carry an underlying irony. the use of extreme measures like ""outlaw miscarriage"" and blaming women for natural occurrences suggests a mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention deduction
   * **rhetorical devices and style:**
     * exaggeration: the idea of outlawing miscarriage is exaggerated and impractical.
     * irony: the statements seem to mock the impracticality and unreasonable expectations of the consistent pro-life stance.
     * sarcasm: the tone appears to undermine the logic behind criminalizing natural processes.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is not seriously advocating for the outlawing of miscarriage. instead, they are pointing out the absurdity and extremities of the argument posed by consistent pro-life advocates. by taking the pro-life argument to its illogical extreme, they are sarcastically criticizing it.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
   comparing the surface sentiment (mocking, exaggerated statements) with the true intention (undermine and criticize extreme pro-life arguments), there's a clear indication that the text is sarcastic. the exaggerated and unrealistic demands serve to highlight the absurdity of the argument being mocked.

"So god rested on the seventh day, but it could've been a millions years?",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the sentence ""so god rested on the seventh day, but it could've been a millions years?"" contains a questioning tone with a hint of incredulity. the phrase ""it could've been a millions years"" introduces an element of exaggeration, which can be a clue for sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
the use of ""a millions years"" exaggerates the biblical account of god resting on the seventh day, implying disbelief or mocking the literal interpretation of the creation story. this hyperbole suggests the speaker is not seriously pondering the timeline but rather using it to question or undermine the traditional narrative.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (questioning and incredulous) matches with the true intention (mocking or undermining the timeline of the biblical creation story). the exaggeration indicates the use of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""i wasn't aware that the candidates were the ones allowed to ask the debate questions. emoticonxconfused""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/sentimental phrases:** ""i wasn't aware"" suggests a potential lack of knowledge.
- **emoji:** emoticonxconfused conveys confusion or surprise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i wasn't aware"" often implies irony, suggesting that it is obvious or expected that candidates should not ask questions.
- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment and the true intention confirms the label ""sarcastic.""

- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the text uses a rhetorical question (""confused?"") and repetition of contradictory statements (""don't believe in killing children unless it's 'absolutely necessary'"", ""can't imagine a time that it would be absolutely necessary""). the clash between these statements highlights the contradiction.
- **context analysis:** the contradiction in the statements suggests that the writer is pointing out an inconsistency in someone else's argument, using a sarcastic tone to emphasize the absurdity of holding two conflicting views.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment indicates confusion and frustration. the true intention, through rhetorical devices and tone, reveals sarcasm aimed at mocking the inconsistency of the statements being critiqued.
- **inference:** the discrepancy between the surface sentiment (apparent confusion) and the true intention (mocking inconsistency) supports the label ""sarcastic.""

- **surface sentiment**: the sentiment appears critical and questioning. the mention of ""lawless cardinal law"" and the reference to ""pomp and circumstance"" suggests a negative tone towards the subject of the sentence.
- **sentimental phrases**: ""lawless cardinal law,"" ""officiating,"" ""funerary masses,"" ""pomp and circumstance"" contribute to a tone of skepticism and disapproval.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence makes use of irony by juxtaposing ""lawless cardinal law"" with ""officiating"" and participating in the ceremonies for the pope's death, which inherently carry a sense of respect and solemnity. this contrast suggests that the speaker finds it inappropriate or hypocritical.
- **language style**: the style is sharply critical, bordering on mocking. by questioning whether someone described as ""lawless"" could be involved in such dignified events, the speaker is indirectly ridiculing the situation.

""that's not evolution, that's abiogenesis. human memory? how long do you suppose that is? decide? now you're pulling our legs. the rest of the ape family will never evolve into humans. btw we are apes. simply not true. your sources are lying to you. truer words were never spoken. except most people with a scientific background reject the supposed evidence against evolution and for good reason, it doesn't exist.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""pulling our legs,"" ""simply not true,"" ""truer words were never spoken.""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases typically would indicate disbelief, strong negation, or mock praise.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""pulling our legs"" is a clear indicator of disbelief or jest. phrases like ""simply not true"" and ""truer words were never spoken"" are often used sarcastically to contradict the preceding statement.
- **language style:** the progression of statements leads to a critical deconstruction of the arguments, employing skepticism and irony to counter positions against evolution.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment and true intention both display significant elements of disbelief and irony.
- the keywords and phrases exhibit typical sarcastic language.

- **sentimental phrases:** the phrases like ""mangling of jesus's teachings,"" ""lying about what i've said,"" and ""par for the course"" typically convey indignation or frustration.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""mangling of jesus's teachings"" implies a deliberate distortion, which can indicate the speaker finds the actions or interpretations misguided or wrong. ""lying about what i've said is just par for the course"" uses a metaphor to suggest habitual actions, underscoring a negative and dismissive sentiment. the mention of entertainment and the general tone suggest a layer of mockery or sarcasm.
- **language style:** the combination of indignation with expressions of predictability and dismissal (e.g. ""standard stuff"") suggests a sarcastic undertone, where the speaker mocks the actions described.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.

step 1: the surface sentiment appears dismissive and incredulous. the phrase ""that's like"" suggests an analogy, often used to draw a comparison that highlights the absurdity of the initial point.

step 2: the sentence uses a metaphor comparing a complex situation (a rainbow with multiple colors) to an overly simplistic and inaccurate perspective (insisting it only has the color red). the true intention is to mock or criticize someone for having an overly simplistic or naive view.

step 3: the analogy is exaggerated to highlight the absurdity of the viewpoint being criticized, which is indicative of sarcasm.

""oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- clues: the phrase ""oh, it's obvious"" hints at a dismissive or condescending tone.
- sentimental phrases: ""nothing will ever change your mind"" is exaggerated, suggesting an immovable stance.
- overall sentiment: although the statement might initially seem factual, the choice of words implies a critical and possibly mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbole (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and generalization (""your mind is not made up on the evidence"").
- language style: the directness and assertiveness hint at irony, especially when paired with phrases like ""obvious,"" which often signal sarcasm.
- underlying message: the speaker likely does not actually believe that the audience's minds are closed solely due to materialism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment vs. true intention: the apparent surface sentiment might come off as a harsh critique, but the tone and exaggeration signal a deeper sarcasm.
- inference: the true intention is not to present a genuine argument but to mock the closed-mindedness attributed to the audience.

- **context analysis:** analyzes the implication that it is unusual or inappropriate for candidates to ask debate questions, hinting at critique or disapproval.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true intention:** the surface sentiment gives an impression of genuine surprise or confusion. however, the rhetorical device (irony) used indicates the sentence is meant to criticize or mock the idea that candidates are asking the questions.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices/language style:** the phrase ""i can't believe"" is often used to express amazement or disbelief but can also be used sarcastically. the word ""insane"" is used to intensify the criticism. the use of ""clearly"" followed by a counter-argument suggests that the speaker thinks their perspective is obvious, implying that the opposing view is ridiculous. the continuation with ""but i'm not surprised"" enhances the sarcastic tone by suggesting predictability in the other person's argument.
- **context analysis:** the sentence is structured to present an argument against the opposing view, utilizing sarcasm to mock the idea that the opposing argument intentionally omits key scriptural references.

- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **rhetorical devices**: the question employs rhetorical devices like exaggeration and potentially sarcasm. asking if someone was on ""speed? lsd? crack?"" is highly exaggerated and likely not a genuine inquiry, suggesting the use of sarcasm.
- **language style**: the repetitive questioning and the listing of extreme substances point towards disbelief and mockery, likely aimed at someone's actions or statements perceived as irrational or misguided.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker implies that the person's behavior or statements were so irrational that they must have been under the influence of extreme substances.

- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""i really don't need your permission or encouragement"" and the double ""thanks"" in different contexts contribute to an underlying sense of dismissiveness or irritation.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses sarcasm and possibly passive-aggressive language. the phrase ""thanks,... but i really don't need your permission or encouragement"" suggests the speaker is not genuinely thankful but rather dismissive of the other person's input.
- **language style**: the style includes polite words (""thanks"") paired with dismissive or corrective follow-ups, suggesting the speaker is downplaying the other person's concern or input dismissively.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

step 1: **surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** the question ""would that be ok just because the majority supports it?"" suggests skepticism or criticism towards majority rule in matters of civil rights. the statement ""civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what"" indicates a strong belief in the inviolability of civil rights.

step 2: **true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the rhetorical question is used to challenge the idea of majority rule being appropriate for decisions about civil rights. it implies that just because a majority supports something does not make it right if it infringes on civil rights. the use of ""ever no matter what"" emphasizes the speaker's firm stance against putting civil rights to a vote.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
   * comparing the surface sentiment and true intention, both align to show a strong, serious stance against the idea of civil rights being subject to majority rule. there is no indication of mockery or irony.

### Example:
Input:
""here we go again. emoticonxrolleyes another bible thumping straight individual with no formal training in the subject matter, professing to be an expert on how homosexuals feel. get a life.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""here we go again"", ""another bible thumping straight individual"", ""no formal training"", ""professing to be an expert"", ""get a life"".
- **emojis/emoticons**: emoticonxrolleyes (indicates eye-rolling, a common sign of exasperation or sarcasm).

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs dismissal and exasperation, indicating dissatisfaction or disbelief. 
- **language style**: the use of phrases such as ""here we go again"" and ""another bible thumping straight individual"" indicates a repetitive and negative tone. the closing remark ""get a life"" functions as a dismissive insult.
- **implied meaning**: the speaker doesn't believe the individual has any true expertise or value to offer on the subject of how homosexuals feel and is expressing contempt toward them.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs true intention**: the surface sentiment is dismissive and negative, as indicated by the eye-rolling emoticon and phrases like ""here we go again"". the true intention, exposed by the use of rhetorical devices and language style, is to mock and discredit the individual’s claim or authority on the matter.

the term ""absolutely no right"" is exaggerated, hinting that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe sotomayor made such an argument. the follow-up ""what's your point?"" implies that the preceding statement is intentionally overstated and not taken seriously.

step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

### Example:
Input:
""well some people say i have split personalities and hacking a forum's software isn't hard to get two users.... so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not. emoticonxcensored""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
   * **clues:** phrases like ""some people say"" often introduce opinions or assumptions about oneself. the statement ""hacking a forum's software isn't hard"" suggests it's an easy task, and this assertion is likely exaggerated. also, the phrase “so maybe i am, or maybe i’m not” is ambivalent and noncommittal.
   * **sentiments:** despite being mixed, the statements use casual, dismissive, and somewhat deflective language. the emoticon ""emoticonxcensored"" implies a non-serious or ironic context.

2. **step 2: true intention deduction**
   * **rhetorical devices and style:** the use of casual language combined with the exaggerated statement about hacking suggests the speaker is not seriously admitting to or denying having split personalities. the phrase ""so maybe i am, or maybe i'm not"" coupled with the knowing nonchalance generally hints at denying the claim but in an ironic fashion.
   * **true meaning:** the speaker is likely not serious about having split personalities or about the supposed ease of hacking software. the overall tone is mocking the idea rather than affirming or denying it genuinely.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals a clear mismatch. the speaker's casual dismissal of what is generally a serious accusation (split personalities) and the exaggerated claim about hacking forums reflect an ironic and mocking stance.

**clues:** 
- the phrases ""wow"", ""actually admits"", ""that makes a change"", and ""silly me"" are notable.
- ""but then he goes and spoils it again"" indicates disappointment or frustration.
- ""he has a habit of redefining stuff"" suggests a criticism of a recurring behavior.

**sentiments:** 
- the statement begins with surprise or mild mockery (""wow, archie actually admits..."").
- it expresses disappointment and frustration with archie's perceived inconsistency.
- the concluding ""silly me"" reflects self-directed mockery for expecting a different outcome.

### step 2: true intention deduction
**rhetorical devices and style:**
- the use of ""actually admits"" and ""that makes a change"" implies a rarity and skepticism about the admission.
- following this with ""but then he goes and spoils it again"" shifts to a critical tone, indicating the initial admission is undermined.
- ""silly me"" being used sarcastically suggests the speaker feels foolish for expecting honesty or consistency.

**true meaning:**
- the speaker is mocking archie for not truly admitting a mistake and for redefining terms to avoid admitting a lack of free will.
- the overall tone combines disappointment, criticism, and self-mockery, indicating sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
comparing the surface sentiment and true intention reveals that the speaker is not genuinely surprised or disappointed but rather mocking archie's behavior. the consistent use of sardonic language and self-mockery clearly indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis

- **sentimental phrases**: however, the use of ""my god,"" ""what was i thinking,"" and the emoticon ""emoticonxrolleyes"" suggest frustration or dissatisfaction.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony. the phrasing ""what was i thinking"" combined with the positive outcomes listed (getting a degree, getting a job) contrasted with an exasperated tone implies that the speaker feels the effort was not worth it or regrets the actions despite their apparent success.
- **language style**: the style appears exaggerated and hyperbolic, particularly with the sarcastic undertone introduced by the rhetorical question and the eye-rolling emoticon.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: while on the surface the actions described are positive, the true intention is revealed to be negative and regretful due to the sarcastic rhetorical question and dismissive emoticon.

""i do recognise the truth, but you know nothing of it. when i hit the other side i'll be in the ground, rotting just like you will be, though i suspect the earth round you will be somewhat more bitter.""

Steps:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment appears condemning and slightly bitter. keywords and phrases like “you know nothing of it,"" ""rotting,"" and ""bitter"" suggest a negative tone.
- **sentimental phrases**: statements such as ""you know nothing"" and ""earth round you will be somewhat more bitter"" contribute to a disparaging tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence uses irony and mocking language, particularly in contrasting the recognition of ""truth"" with the assertion that the listener knows nothing of it.
- **language style**: the style is sharp and biting, suggesting that the speaker is sarcastically diminishing the other person’s understanding or experience.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **compare surface and true sentiment**: the surface sentiment seems disparaging, but there’s an underlying irony. the speaker's claim about recognizing the truth while saying the other knows nothing of it juxtaposes self-praise with scorn towards the other person.
- **inference**: the mismatch between the apparent acknowledgement ""i do recognise the truth"" and the denigrating follow-up establishes the sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
you can't create an artificial minority, wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status. that not how it should works.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - **keywords and phrases:** ""artificial minority,"" ""wave a magic wand,"" ""special status,"" ""that not how it should works.""
    - the keywords imply artificiality and whimsicality in decision-making.
    - the phrase ""wave a magic wand"" suggests an unrealistic or fanciful approach.
    
2. **step 2: true intention**
    - **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""wave a magic wand"" is metaphorical, indicating that the situation described is far-fetched or impractical. 
    - **language style:** the statement uses exaggeration and an almost mocking tone to dismiss the possibility described.
    - **context:** the intention appears to criticize the notion that simply declaring a group ""special"" is enough without considering other practical implications.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
    - **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** on the surface, it seems to reject the possibility of easily granting special status to an artificial minority. the true intention, however, is critical and dismissive, implying the absurdity of the idea.
    - **inference:** the exaggerated and mocking tone, along with the rhetorical flourish, strongly suggests sarcasm.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
the sentence utilizes rhetorical questions and hypotheticals to criticize the opposing viewpoint. the use of ""i suppose"" and repeating ""or i suppose you think"" suggests that the speaker is not genuinely asking for clarification but is instead mocking or belittling the other person's stance. the phrases are exaggerated to make a point.

- **sentimental phrases**: statements like ""you use derogatory rhetoric against god's people"" and ""you're clueless"" contribute to a judgmental and mocking tone.

- **language style**: the style is highly confrontational and sarcastic. the sarcastic remark about barney frank and the mocking tone throughout suggest that the speaker is belittling and ridiculing the other person.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement begins with a seemingly innocent and positive sentiment: ""i love to go to the playground and watch the children jumping up and down."" however, it takes a disturbing turn with the phrase ""they don't know i'm firing blanks.""

### step 2: true intention
the positive and innocent tone in the first part of the sentence (""i love to go to the playground and watch the children jumping up and down"") is contrasted sharply by the disturbing implication in the second part (""they don't know i'm firing blanks.""). the phrase ""firing blanks"" is often used metaphorically to imply a lack of real threat or action, but in this context, it carries a dark, possibly disturbing connotation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment of enjoyment and innocence is mismatched with the dark and unsettling implication of ""firing blanks"" in the presence of children. the shocking nature of the statement strongly suggests a dramatic or sarcastic twist intended to provoke a reaction.

### Example:
Input:
""genocide, are you on drugs? what the hell are you talking about? just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it...........""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
the statement contains strong language and aggressive tones. phrases like ""are you on drugs?"" and ""what the hell are you talking about?"" indicate frustration or incredulity. the phrase ""just don't burn an american flag in front of me and you won't have to worry about it..........."" appears as a disdainful resolution to mitigate a potential issue. 

**step 2: true intention**
by analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's clear that the speaker isn't genuinely concerned about the specific act of burning an american flag but is using it to ridicule or dismiss the previous statement about genocide. the extreme overreaction implies mocking the seriousness or likelihood of flag burning in this context, particularly given the ellipsis which adds a dramatic pause for effect.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
these steps reveal a significant mismatch between the surface sentiment (supposed 'concern' about flag burning) and true intention (ridicule or trivialization of the initial statement about genocide). the exaggerated manner and tone suggest sarcasm, as the speaker's real intention is to ridicule the idea presented as inconsequential.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the statement uses expressions such as ""yeah, yeah, yeah..."" and ""i don't think that i could ever be drunk enough to think waxy was a 'chick'."" the inclusion of ""yeah, yeah, yeah..."" suggests impatience or dismissal. the phrase ""i don't think that i could ever be drunk enough"" indicates an extreme level of disbelief or unlikelihood. the use of quotation marks around ""chick"" and the smiley face emoji "":)"" at the end suggest a lighthearted yet mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
the sentence employs hyperbole (""i don't think that i could ever be drunk enough"") and juxtaposition (""waxy"" and ""chick"") to convey incredulity. the use of quotation marks around ""chick"" implies that the speaker finds it absurd to even consider waxy as a ""chick"". the smiley face emoji reinforces that the statement is made in a mocking or playful manner meant to ridicule the very idea being mentioned.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
the surface sentiment (disbelief expressed in a dismissive and mocking tone) matches the true intention (ridicule or disbelief regarding the idea of waxy being perceived as a ""chick""). the exaggerated expression and the usage of the smiley face underscore that the speaker is not making a serious statement but is instead being sarcastic.
