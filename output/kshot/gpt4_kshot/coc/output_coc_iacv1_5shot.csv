        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords**: ""maybe it came from nowhere,"" ""maybe it was created,"" ""we don't know.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrases expressed suggest uncertainty and ambiguity without strong emotional language.
- **emojis**: none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the repetition of ""we don't know"" and ""maybe"" indicates ambiguity and lack of certainty. this could potentially signal sarcasm if the intention is to mock the lack of a clear answer by highlighting the vagueness.
- **language style**: the language is conversational and repetitive, which can be a hint toward a sarcastic tone, especially when addressing a topic that usually expects a more definitive stance.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment displays a significant level of uncertainty and ambiguity.
- the true intention can be inferred as potentially sarcastic because the repetition of ""we don't know"" and the use of ""maybe"" can suggest mockery about the inability to provide a solid answer.

""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
everything basically. you're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. they decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. and canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or outright illegal depending on just where you live.

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

- the immediate surface sentiment appears to be that of empathy and sympathy for the individual who has to live with a disability.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the phrase ""wow. a very unusual and distressing story,"" may appear to express genuine surprise and distress, but it could also be a set-up for a sarcastic comment.
- following it, the mention of ""probably why saline abortions are no longer used"" introduces a controversial topic in a seemingly factual manner.
- the final part, ""it is very unfortunate for her to have to live with that disability,"" appears sympathetic but could be interpreted as a sarcastic remark about an expected consequence.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- on the surface, the sentiment seems empathetic, but the context and phrasing could be implying sarcasm about the situation surrounding saline abortions.
- the structure resembles a facade of sympathy that might be belied by an underlying critical stance on the use of saline abortions.

everything basically. you're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. they decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. and canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or outright illegal depending on just where you live.

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.

        ### Label: 

        ","**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""stand up for women"", ""stand up for the child"", ""no choice"", ""discriminatory""
- sentimental phrases: the phrases ""stand up for"" suggest advocacy or support. the question ""who's being discriminatory here?"" introduces an accusatory tone.
- no emojis are present.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses comparison and a rhetorical question to imply a hypocritical stance. saying ""you stand up for women.. i stand up for the child"" juxtaposes two different advocacy points, suggesting that one is superior to the other. the rhetorical question ""who's being discriminatory here?"" implies that the original stance is hypocritical or biased.
- language style: the language is confrontational and designed to provoke thought, suggesting that the speaker believes the original stance (supporting women) is flawed or incomplete compared to their own stance (supporting the child).

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment initially appears to be contrasting two stances, but the confrontational language and rhetorical question indicate a critical undertone.
- the true intention reveals the use of sarcasm to point out perceived hypocrisy or bias, suggesting the speaker does not genuinely see the two stances as equally valid.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""

 Example:
Input:
everything basically. you're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. they decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. and canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or outright illegal depending on just where you live.

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label:
sarcastic

### analysis:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""but only if they're willing to receive one. most aren't.""
- sentimental tone: the phrase ""most aren't"" following the condition of willingness implies a sense of resignation or disappointment.
- there are no explicit sentimental phrases or emojis indicative of sarcasm, but the construct raises a flag for potential sarcastic tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- the sentence implies that although something is being offered (perhaps help or advice), the likelihood of it being accepted is very low.
- the tone suggests a criticism or a jab at the unwillingness of the people being referred to.
- the choice of wording hints at frustration or mockery towards those who are not willing.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment indicates resignation and suggests criticism.
- the true intention, upon analyzing the language, reveals that the statement likely mocks the subject's unwillingness in a subtle, sarcastic manner.
- the alignment of passive-aggressive tone and disappointment hints that the statement is sarcastic.

### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""well try,"" ""margins,"" ""votes cast,"" ""margin of victory,"" ""extra votes.""
- sentiment indicators: the text appears to present a factual comparison of voting margins in different states. the phrase ""well try"" could signal skepticism or doubt, but there are no clear sentimental phrases or emojis indicative of sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices/language style: the statement uses factual data and comparisons to make a point about voter behavior and margins of victory for bans compared to presidential election results. the closing sentence, ""it seems like many people other than the 'religious right' feel the same way,"" suggests an argument against a common belief but does not employ obvious hyperbole or irony.
- intention: the speaker possibly aims to correct a misconception or provide evidence against a common narrative about the religious right.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of disbelief or skepticism introduced by ""well try"" aligns with providing factual data to support an argument.
- the intention here does not seem to employ sarcasm. instead, it provides data-driven points to refute or challenge a specific viewpoint.
- there is no clear irony, exaggeration, or mockery present.

Input:
""not entirely true. while we can't disprove that god created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. for example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""not entirely true,"" ""we can disprove,"" ""for example""
- sentimental tone: informative and corrective
- there are no sentimental phrases or emojis indicative of sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

Input:
""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

"""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro.

        ### Input:
        ""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or

- keywords and phrases indicative of contempt and criticism: ""refuted?"", ""o'rly?"", ""strawman,"" ""insane,"" ""retarded,"" ""invalid argument,"" ""idiotic article,"" ""absolutely no evidence.""
- the use of deliberate misspelling ""o'rly?"" is a common textual marker for sarcasm.
- negative adjectives and dismissive rhetoric signal a strong critical and mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- the text deploys rhetorical devices such as sarcasm (""o'rly?""), hyperbolic language (""insane,"" ""retarded,"" ""idiotic"") to emphasize the speaker's disdain and incredulity towards the opposing argument.
- the author's intention is to belittle and ridicule the opposing view on evolution.
- the challenging tone, combined with dismissive language, suggests a desire to mock rather than to provide a purely factual rebuttal.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of scorn and ridicule aligns with the true intention of mocking and discrediting the opposition.
- the use of phrases like ""o'rly?"" and strong negative language confirms the sarcastic nature of the comment.
- the exaggerated critique and dismissive terms underpin the sarcastic tone, as the author intends to scornfully dismiss the counterarguments.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        BWAHAHAHAHHAAH!   Innocent citizens are FIVE TIMES more likely to be mistakenly shot by a cop, than a cop even DELIBERATELY by a civilian!   Likewise, if my life is in danger, then I'm not really too worried about my lack of accountability to the person choosing to ENDANGER it; and I'm really sure if he's willling to commit armed murder then he's not too worried about misdemeanor gun-laws.   Psht, it's amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant these anti-gun XXXXXX are.   It's easy to get cute when someone ELSE'S life is on the line, but it's just plain evil to use the guns of the state, to take away someone ELSE'S guns and expose them to danger-- and particularly cowardly and hyopcrticial while cringing behind a safe neighborhood and lifestyle, while hiding from potential danger-- than shamelessly attacking those who simply fight BACK.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or

Label:
not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""actually, i don't have any respect for creationism in most of its varied forms. i have had great respect for several individual creationists that i have met. but they earned that respect.""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""respect,"" ""don't have any respect,"" ""great respect,"" ""earned that respect.""
   - sentimental phrases: the phrases used are direct and convey respect and lack of respect with clarity, without emotional exaggeration or negativity.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the sentence utilizes contrast but does not employ hyperbole, irony, or other rhetorical figures commonly associated with sarcasm.
   - language style: the language is straightforward and factual, pointing out a distinction between creationist beliefs and individual creationists based on personal experiences.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment is one of clear distinction and conditional respect, which correlates directly with the true intention of the speaker.
   - there is no discrepancy or contrasting meaning that would indicate sarcasm; the message is honest and direct.

""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""well, ya know,"" ""if you actually, oh i don't know,"" ""visited the site,"" ""maybe we're expecting a little too much""
   - sentimental phrases: the use of ""ya know,"" ""oh i don't know,"" and sarcastic emphasis with capitalization ""visited the site"" suggest a mocking or condescending tone.
   - the phrase ""maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist"" is particularly dismissive and suggests scorn or derision.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the intention is clearly mocking; the rhetorical devices used include sarcasm (""oh i don't know, visited the site"") and condescension (""maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist"").
   - the language is confrontational and aims to belittle the person's intelligence or effort in understanding the topic properly.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
   - the surface sentiment displays clear signs of sarcasm through mocking language and emphasis.
   - the true intention matches this sentiment; the author is not genuinely providing information in a neutral or corrective manner but is instead mocking the recipient's understanding and effort.
   
overall, both the surface sentiment and the true intention reinforce that the passage is sarcastic.",1

i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: the phrases indicate a critical sentiment with a tone of frustration and disbelief.
- there are no emojis, but the language used is confrontational and belittling.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses sarcasm to mock the other person’s argument, such as ""my common sense is appalled by yours"" and references to bill maher's satirical statement.
- language style: the language is highly critical and uses irony, especially in the comparison to intelligent design and the use of the word ""retarded"" to ridicule the opponent's argument.
- the mention of ""common sense"" being appalled is ironic, as it flips the opposing argument's sentiment back at them.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment indicates a harsh critique with elements of mockery, particularly in the closing remark that references bill maher’s quote.
- the true intention is to disparage the opponent’s understanding and arguments on biology, using sarcasm to emphasize their perceived ignorance.
- the overall tone and rhetorical style align more with sarcastic intent due to the contrast between the literal criticism and the exaggerated ridicule.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        So I have the choice between staying safe and then claiming insurance damages, or risking my life to kill a burglar and (likely) cause damage to my own property in the process?   Somehow, I'd rather stay safe. Better to lose my laptop than my life.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- keywords and sentimental phrases: ""choice,"" ""staying safe,"" ""claiming insurance damages,"" ""risking my life,"" ""kill a burglar,"" ""i'd rather stay safe,"" ""better to lose my laptop than my life.""
- the overall tone appears to be matter-of-fact but with an undertone of incredulity regarding the choices.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker is highlighting the absurdity of having to choose between personal safety and risking one's life over property. 
- the rhetorical question, combined with the statement ""somehow, i'd rather stay safe,"" suggests that the speaker finds it unreasonable to even consider risking their life for material possessions.
- the phrase ""better to lose my laptop than my life"" reinforces this stance and implies a critique of the notion of facing a burglar with potential lethal force.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment includes a misunderstood practicality of choices but with a note of incredulity.
- the true intention suggests a clear critique of an unreasonable expectation to risk one's life for property.
- the tone and style of the message do carry sarcasm; the speaker is using irony to mock the perceived expectation that one might choose life-threatening action over the safe option of claiming insurance.

### Example:
Input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""yes. (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""yes.""

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

Label:
not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""actually, i don't have any respect for creationism in most of its varied forms. i have had great respect for several individual creationists that i have met. but they earned that respect.""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""respect,"" ""don't have any respect,"" ""great respect,"" ""earned that respect.""
   - sentimental phrases: the phrases used are direct and convey respect and lack of respect with clarity, without emotional exaggeration or negativity.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the sentence utilizes contrast but does not employ hyperbole, irony, or other rhetorical figures commonly associated with sarcasm.
   - language style: the language is straightforward and factual, pointing out a distinction between creationist beliefs and individual creationists based on personal experiences.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment is one of clear distinction and conditional respect, which correlates directly with the true intention of the speaker.
   - there is no discrepancy or contrasting meaning that would indicate sarcasm; the message is honest and direct.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""oh, now we're getting somewhere,"" ""explain more, please,"" ""oh, and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too.""
- sentiment indicators: the use of ""oh"" twice, paired with ""now we're getting somewhere"" and ""please,"" conveys a tone that seems overly polite and encouraging.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices/language style: the repetition of ""oh"" and the phrasing ""explain more, please"" suggests a potentially mocking or disdainful tone, especially in the context of needing ""evidence of incremental modifications.""
- the polite language can be seen as exaggerated, indicating that the speaker might not genuinely be requesting further explanations or evidence, but rather questioning the validity of previous statements.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears polite and encouraging, but the true intention seems to be mocking or questioning someone's statements or evidence.
- this discrepancy, along with the exaggerated politeness, fits the profile of sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

Label:
not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
everything basically. you're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. they decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. and canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or outright illegal depending on just where you live.

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

        ","### step-by-step analysis

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""yet you don't consider quoting the bible,"" ""the single most important original proponent,"" ""doesn't qualify as a source,"" ""expect to be taken seriously?""
- sentimental clues: the phrases ""the single most important original proponent"" and ""expect to be taken seriously?"" seem to carry a tone of disbelief and challenge.

**step 2: true intention**
- the rhetorical question ""you say this and expect to be taken seriously?"" implies skepticism and mocking of the other person's stance.
- the phrasing ""doesn't qualify as a source"" in conjunction with the argument indicates the speaker finds the other person's position to be illogical or laughable.
- the use of ""the single most important"" seems to emphasize the absurdity of not considering the bible a source in the context of creation, adding a layer of irony.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment displays disbelief and incredulity, which matches the true intention of mocking the other person's viewpoint.
- the rhetorical devices of sarcasm are evident in the ending question, which is not genuine but rather meant to disparage the opposing view.

let's break down the process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""for all his dishonesty,"" ""you have to admit,"" ""more honest and forthcoming.""
- sentiment indicators: the use of ""dishonesty"" and the sarcastic statement ""you have to admit he's more honest"" suggest a critical and mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement employs irony, praising someone’s honesty after acknowledging their dishonesty. the author is likely being sarcastic about the honesty of the mentioned person compared to others, implying that none are genuinely honest.
- the phrase ""more honest and forthcoming"" is used in a mocking manner to contrast against the initial claim of ""dishonesty,"" pointing out the perceived hypocrisy.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment’s critical and mocking tone matches with the true intention of pointing out hypocrisy and dishonesty sarcastically.
- the contradiction between being dishonest yet more honest than others, as noted sarcastically, confirms the sarcasm.

- keywords/phrases: ""as is obvious,"" ""not all would.""
- sentimental tone: the phrase ""as is obvious"" could suggest a statement of something that is supposed to be self-evident, potentially leading to implied frustration or dismissal.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the use of ""as is obvious"" can be interpreted as indicating that the matter should be clear to everyone, but the follow-up, ""not all would,"" suggests a contradiction or disagreement with an existing opinion or assumption. this contrast could hint at sarcasm, where the speaker implies the opposite of what they are explicitly stating.
- language style: the dismissive tone ""as is obvious"" followed by the counter statement ""not all would"" uses a hint of irony, where the expectation set by the first part is negated by the second part.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment hints at a potentially frustrated or dismissive attitude using ""as is obvious.""
- the true intention reveals potential sarcasm where the speaker implies that what should be clear to all (""obvious"") is actually not agreed upon by everyone (""not all would""). this contrast creates a classic sarcastic undertone.

- **clues:** the phrase ""your wrong"" instead of ""you're wrong"" is repeated, indicating possible flippancy or a mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention appears to be to criticize and undermine the other person's arguments in a debate about the bible, questioning their reliability and reasoning.
- the language style is confrontational and somewhat dismissive, it suggests disbelief at the opponent's argument, hinting at sarcasm when linking their arguments to a personal, non-factual interpretation.
- phrases like ""fill in the blanks with your own interpretation,"" ""cover this flaw with a story,"" and ""i guess in your mind this makes sense"" are sarcastic jabs at the other person's standpoint, implying that the critic finds the other's argument baseless and flawed.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (critical and disparaging language) aligns with the true intention (to criticize and invalidate the argument in a sarcastic and dismissive manner).
- the use of mocking tone, rhetorical questioning, and dismissive language all indicate sarcasm.

given the analysis, the label is:

### label: sarcastic",1

i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**

- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""generally true,"" ""uses energy,"" ""wasted.""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""that's generally true"" often sets up a statement that seems to acknowledge a fact but can also hint at a dismissive or skeptical tone. the phrase ""some is wasted"" might carry a slightly indifferent or resigned tone.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the sentence employs a generalization (""that's generally true of any process that uses energy"") which could be interpreted as stating the obvious. the added comment ""some is wasted"" seems somewhat dismissive as it points out an inherent flaw or inefficiency in a perfunctory manner.
- language style: the language is straightforward but has a potential underlying tone of trivializing the issue. this can be seen as a subtle form of sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: neutral to slightly dismissive.
- true intention: the phrase could be emphasizing the obviousness of energy waste, which might trivialize the statement it follows.
- sarcasm detection: the dismissive tone and the generalization suggest less of a factual declaration and more of a sarcastic undercurrent, implying the issue being discussed is too obvious or not worthy of debate.

- **sentimental tone:** the use of repeated quotation marks suggest a skeptical or dismissive tone.
- **emojis:** none.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of quotation marks around words like ""where,"" ""sit,"" ""always,"" ""eternity,"" and ""time"" emphasizes these concepts in a way that hints at mocking or disbelief. the term ""maybe"" at the end adds more to the sarcastic tone, as if leaving room for doubt with an air of skepticism.
- **language style:** the overall tone is skeptical and dismissive, which is characteristic of sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment includes skeptical and dismissive quotes along with the word ""actually,"" which is often used in sarcastic commentary.
- the true intention demonstrates an attempt to deconstruct or question the concept being discussed, in a way that implies disbelief or mockery.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

- **keywords/phrases**: ""great"" and ""evangelist"" (contradictory pairing implying irony or mockery), ""military intelligence"" (often used in a sarcastic context as an oxymoron), ""unanswered questions"" (indicating skepticism or criticism). 
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of ""great"" and ""evangelist"" together and comparing it to ""military intelligence"" (a common example of an oxymoron) clearly indicates a mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices / language style**: the use of oxymorons (""great evangelist"" and ""military intelligence"") is a clear indication of sarcasm, implying that the speaker does not believe a great evangelist exists, similar to how people often perceive ""military intelligence"" as contradictory. the tone is critical and mocking, questioning and undermining the credibility of the ""preacher.""

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: sarcastic and mocking.
- **true intention**: the speaker clearly uses sarcasm to mock the idea of a ""great evangelist"" and to express doubt about the validity of the ""preacher."" there is a discrepancy between the literal meaning (which would be neutral or positive) and the actual implied meaning (which is negative and mocking).

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

Input:
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

2. **true intention:**
   - rhetorical devices: heavy use of irony, mockery, and sarcasm indicated by the parenthesis and the deliberate cough spelling indicate a non-literal and critical tone.
   - language style: the language style is combative and mocking, designed to challenge and belittle the viewpoint of the person being addressed (grizzly6626), thus showing disagreement and contempt.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment of mockery and derision aligns with the true intention of criticizing and belittling the other person's argument.
   - the use of sarcasm is prevalent throughout, employing rhetorical devices and a scornful tone to highlight the disbelief and mock the opposing viewpoint.

        Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords/phrases**: ""do you mean someone who was wrong?"" ""i asked you before,"" ""give an example,"" ""you failed to do so,"" ""i suspect that you can't.""
- **sentimental indicators**: the use of past tense like ""i asked you before"" and ""you failed to do so"" suggests a sense of frustration or impatience. ""i suspect that you can't"" implicitly questions the other person's ability.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the sequence of statements seems to employ a challenging tone, possibly intending to point out a perceived inconsistency or inability in the other person's argument.
- **language style**: the language is direct and seems to provoke a reaction. the use of ""i suspect that you can't"" may suggest rhetorical doubt, leaning towards a mocking or challenging undertone.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment, which appears impatient and challenging, aligns with the true intention of questioning the other person’s capability, thus employing a mocking undertone.
- **inference**: the combination of challenging questions and rhetorical doubt indicates a possible sarcastic remark, aiming to highlight the other person’s failure to provide an example.

i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

        ### Input:
        Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: not sarcastic

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""modified,"" ""refined,"" ""produced,” “allowed,” “pleased.""
- sentimental phrases: the passage explains an evolutionary process in a detailed and technical manner.
- emojis: none present.

**step 2: true intention**
- the passage intends to provide a factual explanation of how evolution and natural selection operate.
- the final sentences (""and do show us your numbers... if you don't know how, i'd be pleased to show you..."") suggest an openness to engage in further discussion, with a willingness to educate.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the surface sentiment of being informative and educational matches the true intention.
- there are no signs of mockery, irony, or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm. the speaker is earnest in their explanation and offer to provide further information.

therefore, the passage is labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0
"(Note the key word ""also,"" which admits that it's human).

### Example:
Input:
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

Label:
not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.

- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        This claim might be true, but do you have any citations about Carl Burgh's fraudulent claims? (ps I note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book! It's nice to feel special)   I know of this site   http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/carl_baugh_page.htm   which makes the claim, but I'd be interested to learn more about this alleged fraud

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""this claim might be true,"" ""do you have any citations,"" ""nice to feel special,"" ""interested to learn more""
- sentimental phrases: the initial part of the sentence shows a willingness to consider the claim (""this might be true""), while the latter part shows an interest in learning more. however, ""nice to feel special"" stands out as a potential indicator of sarcasm, given its context.
- clues: the phrasing and inclusion of ""nice to feel special"" in parentheses suggest a potential mocking tone.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""ps i note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book! it's nice to feel special"" employs sarcasm by pretending to feel honored or special. this actually mocks the original claim that a citation was needed, possibly emphasizing that such a demand is unnecessary or trivial.
- language style: the language style combines a polite inquiry with a mocking parenthesis, likely suggesting disbelief or disdain towards the person making the initial claim.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment initially appears neutral or inquisitive but shifts with the parenthetical note. the true intention, when considering rhetorical devices, reveals sarcasm designed to mock the demand for citations.
- the noticeable discrepancy between the polite inquiry and the mocking parenthesis indicates a sarcastic undercurrent.

i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

- sentimental tone: the use of ""obviously"" can imply a condescending or dismissive tone. the repetition of ""obvious"" suggests a potentially mocking stance.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the repeated use of ""obvious"" may indicate an intent to criticize or question the assumption that the red cross is inherently christian just because many of its contributors are christians. the rhetorical question ""but is the red cross christian?"" sets up a premise that the following assertion questions.
- language style: the phrasing can imply that the statement is pointing out the flaw in a common assumption, possibly to highlight that the affiliation of contributors doesn't necessarily define the organization itself.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment, indicated by the repetition of ""obvious,"" leans towards a tone of mockery or sarcasm.
- the true intention appears to challenge the assumption that the red cross is christian by highlighting the oversimplified logic behind the claim.
- both the surface sentiment and true intention point to an underlying irony or mockery, suggesting a sarcastic tone.

""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**:
   - keywords/phrases: ""we agree! excellent!""
   - sentiment indicators: these phrases appear positive and enthusiastic on the surface.

2. **step 2: true intention**:
   - rhetorical devices: the overemphasis with ""excellent!"" suggests possible insincerity. the context of the agreement being too enthusiastic or exaggerated often implies sarcasm.
   - language style: the brevity and overenthusiastic tone hint that the speaker may not genuinely believe what they are agreeing to, or they are mocking the agreement.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**:
   - the surface sentiment of positivity and enthusiasm contrasts with the underlying insincerity or mock agreement. this discrepancy is a hallmark of sarcasm.

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing. There was nobody there at all, no human anyway.",0,"

        ### Input:
        So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing. There was nobody there at all, no human anyway.

- the exaggerated criticism and the use of ""even most christians would disagree with you"" presents a form of irony, suggesting that the point being argued is not as complex or obscure as the person makes it out to be.

### Example:
Input:
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

Label:
not sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""yes. (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""yes.""
- clues: the phrase ""yes"" indicates a straightforward affirmation. 

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

Label:
not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""

When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- keywords/phrases: ""really,"" ""c being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year,"" ""hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year,"" ""b becomes pretty insignificant.""
- sentimental indicators: the use of ""really"" at the beginning of the statement can imply skepticism or disbelief, which often aligns with a sarcastic tone. however, the remainder of the text appears to present factual information about gun use statistics.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices/language style: the initial ""really"" combined with statistically heavy information suggests an intention to highlight the perceived insignificance of ""b"" in the debate. this fits a style where factual information is used to underline the point that the issue being discussed (b) is minor compared to the larger context provided by the stats.
- the tone of using ""really"" at the start can imply that the speaker finds the opposing argument or concern to be overblown or misguided, potentially indicating sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment implies skepticism and potentially sarcasm, particularly with the opening ""really"" casting doubt on the opposing viewpoint's significance.
- the true intention appears to be to undermine the perceived importance of point b by comparing it against much larger statistics, a common technique in sarcastic rebuttals by trivializing the opposition's concern.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords/phrases:
  - ""i'm not surprised""
  - ""that's a typical response""
  - ""calls your bluff""
  - ""waxy""
- sentimental tone:
  - the text shows a dismissive and potentially condescending tone.
  - the phrase ""calls your bluff"" may imply that the speaker does not believe the other person was being truthful or serious in the first place.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices / language style:
  - the text employs subtle sarcasm, as the speaker pretends to be unsurprised by an action they clearly criticize (calling someone's bluff).
  - the use of ""typical response"" indicates the speaker's disapproval or disdain, suggesting it is a predictable reaction that lacks originality or honesty.
  - ""waxy"" as an exclamation appears dismissive, possibly conveying the speaker's frustration or disdain.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment shows a clear dismissive and potentially mocking tone.
- the true intention further adds a layer of sarcasm by downplaying and ridiculing the other person's alleged predictable behavior.
- the alignment between the surface sentiment (dismissive, critical) and the true intention (sarcastic ridicule) strongly supports the classification of sarcasm.

### steps:
**step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?**
- keywords/phrases: ""no, that's just the pork tacked onto the original bill.""
- surface sentiment: the use of ""no"" followed by ""just the pork tacked onto"" suggests a dismissive or minimizing tone. ""pork"" in legislative terms refers to unnecessary or unrelated additions to a bill, often seen as wasteful or deceptive.

**step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.**
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""just the pork tacked onto the original bill"" uses irony to imply that the additional provisions (the ""pork"") are more significant than just incidental.
- language style: the language underplays the significance sarcastically, suggesting the additional provisions are substantial and problematic, contrary to the casual dismissal.

**step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.**
- comparison: the surface sentiment appears to downplay the additions to the bill, but the irony indicates that the speaker actually considers the ""pork"" a serious issue.
- the minimizing language juxtaposed with the implication that the additions are significant and deceptive indicates sarcasm.",1

 Example:
Input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""

- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

Label: 
not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

Label: not sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""actually, i don't have any respect for creationism in most of its varied forms. i have had great respect for several individual creationists that i have met. but they earned that respect.""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""respect,"" ""don't have any respect,"" ""great respect,"" ""earned that respect.""
   - sentimental phrases: the phrases used are direct and convey respect and lack of respect with clarity, without emotional exaggeration or negativity.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the sentence utilizes contrast but does not employ hyperbole, irony, or other rhetorical figures commonly associated with sarcasm.
   - language style: the language is straightforward and factual, pointing out a distinction between creationist beliefs and individual creationists based on personal experiences.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment is one of clear distinction and conditional respect, which correlates directly with the true intention of the speaker.
   - there is no discrepancy or contrasting meaning that would indicate sarcasm; the message is honest and direct.

- sentimental tone: the language is somewhat dismissive and condescending, particularly in the suggestion to do research and the statement about seeking an easy debate victory. the use of quotation marks around ""know"" hints at sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- the speaker is critiquing the other person's view of evolution, suggesting they have an overly simplistic or naive understanding.
- the recommendation to do research is sarcastically implying that the other person lacks knowledge.
- the statement about seeking an ""easy debate victory"" is clearly sarcastic, implying the other person’s arguments are weak.
- the concluding remarks seem to mock the idea of flaws as evidence against a deity, implying that any argument could be countered by invoking god's will.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- surface sentiment is both corrective and condescending, with clear instances of sarcasm in phrases like ""magical and mystical way"" and ""easy debate victory.""
- true intention combines critique and mockery, with a sarcastic tone underpinning the argument.

"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.",0,"

i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.

        ### Input:
        You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.

i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:**

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

This is utter BS, if you can find ANY proof of the Canadian gov't stifling free speech on this issue, religious freedom, or any other issue for that matter, please post it.

I come across a very broad spectrum of people in my line of work, from one end of the scale to the other.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""i hope,"" ""i have already begun to change your mind.""
- sentimental tone: the phrase ""i hope"" typically connotes a positive sentiment or optimism.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the context and phrasing suggest that the speaker is doubtful or skeptical about having changed the other person's mind. this could imply that they don't actually believe they have succeeded in changing the person's opinion.
- the tone could be read as somewhat mocking or resigned, indicating sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the optimistic surface sentiment of ""i hope"" contrasts with the true intention, which seems skeptical or doubtful. the use of ""already begun"" in a context where the speaker likely knows their influence has been minimal further supports the sarcastic inference.
- given the mismatch between the surface optimism and the underlying doubt, the statement is likely sarcastic.",1

Steps:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Actually, Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong. The fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""proven you and cash to be utterly wrong,"" ""fact you don't recognize this""
- sentimental tone: the phrase ""utterly wrong"" suggests a strong negative sentiment directed at the recipient. the phrase ""fact you don't recognize this"" implies some frustration or dismissal of the recipient's perspective.
- emotional cues: no emojis, but the tone is confrontational and dismissive.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the use of ""actually"" at the beginning could imply a correction or rebuttal. the overall language suggests the speaker is trying to assert a point rather than genuinely informing or correcting.
- language style: the sentence is constructed to emphasize the recipient's perceived mistake and their lack of recognition of it. the emphasis on being ""utterly wrong"" and the dismissive tone hints at a mocking or sarcastic undertone.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment is strongly negative and dismissive, confronting the recipient with their supposed errors.
- the true intention appears to assert dominance in the argument and mock the recipient's understanding or recognition of the facts.
- the tone and choice of language (e.g., ""utterly wrong,"" ""irrelevant"") align more with sarcastic mockery than with a straightforward confrontation or correction.

- keywords/phrases: ""and here our government says""
- sentiment indicators: the phrase seems neutral, simply stating what the government is saying.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the phrase ""and here our government says"" could be interpreted in different ways depending on context and tone, implying skepticism or a contrast between actual practices and stated principles. the lack of further context to provide concrete examples leaves space for interpreting potential sarcasm, especially if this is in a context critical of the government.
  
**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears neutral.
- however, the phrase's structure can imply that the speaker is skeptical or derisive about the government's statement, suggesting sarcasm by contrasting the ideal (‘rights and responsibilities’) with an implied real-world failure to uphold it.

- language style: the language used indicates a questioning and potentially mocking tone towards the literal belief in these signs.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment cites a religious text that promises miraculous signs for believers.
- the true intention, especially with the concluding question, seems to imply that the speaker finds these promises dubious or absurd.
- the presence of irony and skepticism aligns more with sarcastic sentiment.

- **keywords/phrases:** ""fascinating one,"" ""self-organising systems,"" ""self-regulating system,"" ""interesting to read,"" ""feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along',"" ""real, hard-core theory.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""fascinating one"" and ""interesting to read"" convey a somewhat positive tone initially.
- **clues:** ""feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory"" introduces skepticism or critique, likely suggesting sarcasm.
- **emojis:** none present.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory"" indicates a mockery of the gaia theory and daisyworld model, suggesting it is not taken seriously.
- **language style:** the language shifts from interest to skepticism with a sarcastic jab at the theory's perceived lack of rigor: ""a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along'"".
- **contrast/irony:** there is a clear contrast between the initial description of the theory as ""fascinating"" and the criticism that follows.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the initial positive tone of fascination and interest is sharply contrasted with the skepticism expressed in the phrase ""a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory.""
- this contrast aligns with the characteristics of sarcasm, where the actual intent is to mock or criticize despite surface-level positive language.

        Well, Google is your friend here - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.   It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as ""one big preservation event"" and lots of ""little preservations"". If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation.   I've been a bit vague here as it is a) such a broad subject to describe succinctly b) I'm tired and c) I'm full of cold   No doubt someone who isn't under the influence of b) and/or c) will chime in as well with more details while I pull round.   Now, where was my hankerchief......

### step 2: deduce the true intention
- rhetorical devices: the analogies seem to simplify the scenarios to highlight a perceived fault in logical consistency. comparisons made between pregnancy and inviting a stranger into one’s home might be construed as an argument against abortion.
- language style: the text is formal and structured, trying to logically dismantle an opposing argument. there is no apparent irony, exaggeration, or hidden contempt.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the sentiment in step 1 (serious and logical) aligns with the intention in step 2 (arguing against abortion using analogies).
- there is no evidence of sarcasm since the argument is presented earnestly without any indicators of irony, satire, or mockery.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
the surface sentiment appears to be positive. the phrase ""excellent point doc"" suggests that the speaker is acknowledging a good point made by someone else, presumably a doctor or someone with a doctorate.

### step 2: true intention
however, the phrase could also be read with a sarcastic tone, especially considering that such phrases often carry an implied contradiction in informal or contentious exchanges. the usage of ""doc"" can sometimes be dismissive or ironic, implying that the speaker doesn’t actually regard the point as excellent.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- surface sentiment: positive acknowledgment (keywords: ""excellent point"").
- true intention: possible sarcasm indicated by the casual and potentially dismissive use of ""doc.""

given these considerations, the phrase ""excellent point doc"" is likely sarcastic, as it might imply the opposite of the literal meaning.

""you're working at the wrong end of the problem. we need young to survive. it's the old that are expendable.""

### steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""wrong end of the problem,"" ""young to survive,"" ""old are expendable.""
- sentiment indicators: the text portrays a harsh and provocative sentiment. the phrase ""the old that are expendable"" is particularly strong and suggests a very controversial or cold viewpoint.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement employs a shock tactic by presenting a controversial idea—that the old are expendable—in a blunt manner. this can be interpreted as satire or sarcasm, as it challenges a commonly held value (that all lives are important) in an exaggerated way.
- the use of ""you're working at the wrong end of the problem"" suggests that the speaker is criticizing a misplaced focus or effort, possibly mockingly.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment suggests a provocative or shocking stance, likely to evoke a reaction.
- the true intention appears to be to criticize or mock the absurdity of prioritizing one age group over another in a harsh manner.
- combining both analyses, the tone and content indicate a high likelihood of sarcasm, given the exaggerated coldness and controversial nature of the statement.

""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

        Damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge. Do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?   While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang', he was mocking it. Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe, which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence.   FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or

        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords / sentimental phrases:** ""damn,"" ""lack of knowledge,"" ""ignorant as all heck,"" ""ffs,"" ""do try to use a source.""
- **emotional clues:** the use of ""damn"" and ""ffs"" (for f***'s sake) suggests frustration. phrases like ""lack of knowledge"" and ""ignorant as all heck"" are clearly derogatory.
- **sentiment indicators:** there are strong negative sentiments, often contemptuous and condescending.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** 
  - there is clear use of mocking and derision in the language.
  - the phrase ""ffs, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?"" is sarcastic, implying that the person's sources are fundamentally flawed.
  - the use of ""damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge"" is sarcastic as it is saying the opposite of what is intended – implying the links are extremely poor.
- **language style:** 
  - the language is highly critical and intended to demean the credibility of the sources cited by the other person.
- **irony:** \
  - there is considerable irony in expecting the sources to be knowledgeable while simultaneously calling them ignorant.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **surface sentiment:** shows high frustration and contempt.
- **true intention:** uses sarcasm to criticize and ridicule the other person's sources.
- **match:** both surface sentiment and true intention show strong negative criticism with a clear sarcastic tone.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""guns laws,"" ""affect criminals,"" ""explain,"" ""low rates,"" ""uk.""
- sentimental phrases: the phrasing appears to be questioning with a potential undertone of skepticism towards the effectiveness of gun laws in deterring criminal activity.
- emojis: none present.

### step 2: true intention
- the sentence seems to be engaging in a rhetorical question, typically used to challenge or refute an opposing argument indirectly.
- the use of the specific example of the uk, known for its strict gun laws and low rates of gun crime, implies a comparison with other nations, possibly suggesting that gun laws can affect criminal behavior.
- there is a hint of irony because the question implies that the supposed ineffectiveness of gun laws is refuted by real-world evidence.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains a questioning tone that aligns with skepticism.
- the true intention is to challenge the view that gun laws don't affect criminals, using the uk as an example.
- the rhetorical question and implied irony both point towards a sarcastic tone, as the stated idea (that gun laws don't affect criminals) is contrasted with evidence suggesting the opposite.

"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws.

""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

        Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see.

- language style: the style is informal and direct, with a mix of personal opinions and mocking sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment indicates an aggressive and dismissive tone.
- the true intention reveals that the speaker is using hyperbole and mockery, indicating a sarcastic tone.

- keywords and phrases: ""let's not confuse our readers,"" ""supersport is not saying,"" ""should be clear now,"" ""scientists recognized perfectly well.""
- sentimental phrases: the statement suggests some condescension or irritation. phrases like ""should be clear now"" and ""recognize perfectly well"" seem to imply that the issue being discussed should be obvious to the reader.

### step 2: true intention

- language style: there is a sense of condescension which can be indicative of sarcasm. the use of quotation marks around ""evolutionists"" further suggests that the writer is mocking the term or the people being referenced.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows irritation or condescension with an implication that the writer finds the situation obvious and possibly ridiculous.
- the true intention seems to be pointing out an obvious error or misunderstanding, which aligns with sarcastic undertones by emphasizing how clear and evident the correct understanding should be.
- the contrast between the literal statement (which appears to clarify) and the tone (which suggests that the readers should obviously already understand this) indicates sarcasm.

upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

        Oh sorry, I didn't understand what you were asking.   Ok, what I think happened {Like Tasyfish hinted at} was that Moses recorded what god told him or Genesis 1 because it is in more detail, and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah, in Oral history, so it would differ slightly, but that's becaue of man's error, not God's.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:

- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

Steps:
**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

Steps:
**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:**

Steps:

- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""fire extinguisher,"" ""self-defense,"" ""seat belt,"" ""god bless.""
- **sentimental phrases**: ""i have never had a fire in my kitchen,"" ""pray i'll never need it,"" ""i'll be damn glad i'm wearing it.""
- the overall tone appears sincere and serious, emphasizing safety and preparedness.

**step 2: true intention:**

- **rhetorical devices**: the use of real-life comparisons (fire extinguisher, seat belt) to communicate the necessity of carrying firearms for self-defense.
- the intention seems to be earnest rather than ironic or mocking.

**step 3: compare and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (sincere concern and seriousness) aligns with the true intention (emphasizing preparedness without any underlying mockery or irony).
- there is no significant contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention.

**conclusion:**
- the message is consistent in advocating the importance of being prepared for emergencies, using straightforward analogies without any signs of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** ""actually he is,"" ""it is a pity,"" ""unwilling to debate,"" ""smear campaign,"" ""i would advise.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""it is a pity"" suggests a tone of condescension or disappointment, while ""unwilling to debate"" and ""smear campaign"" paint a negative picture of the person being addressed.
- **overall surface tone:** negative and critical.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""it is a pity"" is likely intended to be sarcastic because it is used in a context where the author is expressing disapproval or disdain.
- **language style:** the use of ""endeavour a smear campaign"" and advising the person to read before talking again suggests a tone of reprimand and contempt rather than genuine pity.
- **intended meaning:** the author is mocking or criticizing the person they are addressing, implying they are not worth debating and instead engage in unproductive or dishonest behavior.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment appears to be negative, but when analyzing the language style and rhetorical devices, it's evident the author is using sarcasm to criticize rather than simply expressing disapproval.
- **inference:** the disparity between the superficial negative sentiment and the deeper, mocking intention indicates sarcasm.",1
"Repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological than the first, second and third time you were shown it to be so. Skeletons, even from the BRONZE age, let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age, are not fossils.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
Label:

 Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""superstitious nonsense,"" ""no less mythological,"" ""incorrect reference.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of ""superstitious nonsense,"" and ""incorrect reference"" suggests a negative and dismissive tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological"" employs ridicule towards another person's beliefs or statements, implying they are baseless regardless of repetition.
- **language style**: the specific and emphatic correction regarding ""skeletons"" and ""bronze age"" vs. ""stone age"" suggests a tone of superiority or correcting misinformation.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment already indicates ridicule and skepticism. the true intention confirms this as the author seeks to correct what they see as laughable or ignorant claims.
- **inference**: the corrective and mocking nature of the statements reveals sarcasm.

"Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors.

well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","based on the presented text, let's analyze it step-by-step.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** ""color is a function of the wavelength of light,"" ""humans can only see a subset of those colors,"" ""cells tuned to three ranges of wavelengths,"" ""edit: and just to address one other point.""
- the tone throughout most of the text is factual and educational, providing information about how humans perceive color and the limitations of the human eye.

**step 2: true intention**
- the text aims to deliver information objectively. however, the phrase ""does this dispell your confusion?"" can be scrutinized for potential sarcasm, as it could imply that the reader should already understand this information.
- additionally, the ""edit: and just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye."" line reinforces the factual nature of the content but could also imply a slightly condescending tone towards someone who might have previously questioned this information.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the majority of the text is purely educational and factual, with only slight undertones in the ""does this dispell your confusion?"" and ""edit"" sections that may hint at sarcasm.
- the overall intent of the passage is to inform, and any sarcastic undertone, if present, is minimal. 

so, on balance, given the overwhelmingly factual tone of the passage and the slight possibility of sarcasm which does not overshadow the primary intent, the most appropriate label is:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""irrational,"" ""i could not possibly comment,"" ""grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the atlantic,"" ""flatter yourself,"" ""a pun.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the expressions of ""grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side,"" and ""you flatter yourself"" clearly indicate negativity or contempt.

**step 2: true intention**

- **rhetorical devices:** 
  - the phrase ""i could not possibly comment"" is a british understatement often used sarcastically.
  - ""grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the atlantic"" exaggerates geographical bias for rhetorical effect.
  - ""you flatter yourself"" directly dismisses the other person's relevance or importance.
- **language style:** the language is formal yet cutting, employing irony and condescension to convey disdain.

**step 3: compare and analysis**

- **surface sentiment vs. true intention:** while the surface sentiment might pass for a serious commentary upon initial inspection, the underlying use of irony, condescension, and dismissal reveals a deeper sarcasm.

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
Label:

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases:** ""please do not exaggerate,"" ""mis-quoting,"" ""care to produce some figures,"" ""habit of making over-inflated statements.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be critical and condescending, indicating frustration with the other person’s behavior.

### step 2: true intention

- **rhetorical devices:** sarcasm is present in phrases like ""care to produce some figures"" and ""its just you have a habit,"" where the author implies disbelief in the other person’s statements and exaggeration.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the critical and condescending surface sentiment aligns with the true intention of mocking and criticizing the other person for exaggeration. the use of polite language is a thin veneer covering the underlying disdain, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Steps:

- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

- the phrase ""shh shhh it's ok mellow mellow mellow. relax"" suggests an attempt to calm someone, indicating a surface level of reassurance.
- phrases like ""you have managed to go from legalizing gay marriage to a collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man's ability to reason and govern himself"" mock the idea that these events are connected.
- the sentiment appears to be sarcastic in nature, as indicated by the exaggerated shift from gay marriage to the downfall of civilization.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention reveals itself through the hyperbolic connection made between legalizing gay marriage and the collapse of the legal system. this is clearly an exaggerated and sarcastic commentary.
- the second part of the statement, ""maybe gay people would like to enjoy some of the happiness you get from your marriage..."" uses a seemingly sincere tone to highlight the absurdity of the supposed threat posed by gay marriage.
- the final line, ""you may have more in common with gay people than you think,"" further underlines the mockery by suggesting that the speaker finds the original argument both overblown and unfounded.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment seems to calm and reassure initially but quickly shifts to exaggerated and hyperbolic criticism.
- the true intention is to mock the extreme reaction against the legalization of gay marriage, using irony and hyperbole for effect.
- the contrast between the calming introduction and the mocking, exaggerated argument amplifies the sarcastic tone.

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

the statement ""so i pray to chance every night before i go to bed?"" has a sentence structure and language style that suggest sarcasm. 

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** ""pray to chance.""
- **surface emotion:** uncertainty or incredulity.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the concept of ""praying to chance"" is inherently contradictory, as prayer is usually directed towards a deity or higher power, not random chance. this contradiction implies a critical or mocking tone.
- **language style:** the question form implies disbelief or mockery, suggesting the speaker finds the notion of ""praying to chance"" absurd or ridiculous.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment indicates incredulity or confusion.
- the true intention, revealed through the contradictory nature of ""praying to chance,"" is to mock the idea by highlighting its absurdity.
- the contrast between the incredulous tone and the absurdity of the statement indicates sarcasm.

therefore, the label is:

### label: sarcastic",1

### Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

### label: sarcastic

#### explanation:

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""sin tax,"" ""lying propaganda damage,"" ""fair,"" ""responsibilities,"" ""next!""
- the surface sentiment appears critical and somewhat cynical, particularly regarding the concept of imposing a sin tax on speaking or logging onto the internet.

**step 2: true intention:**
- the term ""sin tax of $100 dollars each time you log on and $10 dollars a word for each time you speak one"" is clearly hyperbolic and not a serious proposal.
- phrases like ""lying propaganda damage"" and ""it's fair"" seem to mock the idea being criticized.
- ""next!"" indicates dismissal and impatience, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (cynical/critical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between the exaggerated proposal and the underlying criticism suggests sarcasm.",1

oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: ""age of law,"" ""age of grace,"" ""god of swift and harsh justice,"" ""god is all-forgiving.""
- **sentimental phrases**: ""hang on a minute.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a discussion about theological or philosophical periods with a somewhat thoughtful tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of juxtaposition between the ""age of law"" and the ""age of grace"" suggests a comparison meant to highlight a perceived inconsistency or change in divine behavior.
- **language style**: the phrase ""god of swift and harsh justice"" juxtaposed with ""god is all-forgiving"" implies skepticism towards these concepts. the final phrase ""hang on a minute"" indicates a moment of realization or doubt.
- **intended meaning**: the intention behind the text seems to criticize or mock the simplistic division between two theological periods, suggesting the speaker finds the explanation unsatisfactory or overly simplistic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **surface vs. true meaning**: the surface sentiment appears serious and analytical, but the true intention reveals skepticism and mockery. the satirical tone is evident in the casual dismissal with ""hang on a minute.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**

- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**

Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords**: ""rather unsurprisingly,"" ""u.s. constitution,"" ""australian law.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""rather unsurprisingly"" hints at a lack of surprise, implying that the information is expected or logical. 

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the choice of ""rather unsurprisingly"" shows that the statement aligns with common sense or general knowledge.
- **language style**: the expression is straightforward and factual, indicating that the u.s. constitution logically does not impact australian law.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment suggests an obvious or expected assertion.
- the true intention supports this view with a direct and logical assertion about the lack of influence of the u.s. constitution on australian law.
- there is no contrast between surface sentiment and true intention; both point towards a straightforward declaration without mockery or sarcasm.

therefore, the label is **not sarcastic**.",0

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

        ### Input:
        So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: expressions such as ""so you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an uzi and carry it into a federal courthouse or school"" and ""as long as he does not commit a crime?"" indicate extreme, hyperbolic scenarios.
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of exaggerated scenarios (""10 y/o to buy an uzi"", ""new murderers and thieves...are born every day"") suggests heightened emotional expression.
- **surface sentiment**: the tone appears to criticize through extreme examples, bordering on outrage or disdain.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the extreme hypothetical situations used (""10 y/o to buy an uzi"", ""new murderers and thieves...are born every day"") highlight an absurdity. this suggests an ironic stance meant to criticize or mock the notion being questioned (lack of gun control).
- **language style**: the exaggerated 'what-if' scenarios and the conclusion about a limitless supply of criminals signal a critical, satirical approach.
- **true intention**: the speaker is using hyperbole and irony to ridicule the idea that gun control concerns would vanish if criminals were removed from the streets, thereby emphasizing the perceived flaws in that logic.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention**: the surface sentiment of extreme, exaggerated scenarios aimed at ridicule matches the true intention of criticizing the logic behind the argument.
- **inference**: the evident disparity between the surface sentiment (appearing logical at first glance) and the hyperbolic, ironic criticism confirms the sarcastic nature.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

        Wow, you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud? I didn't see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals. I must have overlooked it. Can you give the reference to your article?

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
- keywords and phrases: ""wow,"" ""proved,"" ""big bang,"" ""clear refutation,"" ""overlooked,"" ""peer reviewed scientific journals.""
- the surface sentiment seems to show surprise, admiration, and a genuine request for a reference to an article disproving the big bang theory.

### step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
- the use of ""wow"" and caps lock on ""proved"" suggests exaggeration, indicating possible sarcasm.
- the statement, ""i didn't see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals,"" is highly unlikely to be sincere, especially since such ground-breaking refutations would indeed be covered widely.
- the phrase, ""i must have overlooked it,"" along with the polite ask for a reference adds to the irony, implying disbelief that such a refutation exists.

### step 3: compare and analysis step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.
- the surface sentiment implies admiration and a genuine inquiry.
- the true intention reveals disbelief and mockery aimed at the claim of disproving the big bang theory.
- the contrast between the surface level of respectful inquiry and the underlying mockery of the claim indicates a sarcastic tone.

So are you saying that the people of India aren't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered?

### Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

- **surface emotion**: confrontational, possibly accusatory.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions like ""are you saying that...?"" suggests disbelief or critique of the presumed opposing viewpoint.
- **language style**: the repeated questioning and framing of the situation imply that the speaker is incredulous or mocking the idea that people wouldn't be upset or seeking changes.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface vs. true meaning**: the surface sentiment appears to question and critique the perceived inaction or apathy, while the true intention, revealed through the rhetorical questions and tone, strongly suggests mockery or disbelief at the idea that the people of india wouldn't care or want to take action.
- this mismatch between surface sentiment (questioning, accusatory) and true intention (mockery, disbelief) is indicative of sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the detailed listing of various weapons and combat gear creates a tone of excessive preparedness.
- phrases like ""preparedness my friends..."" and ""dear mr. criminal"" indicate a boastful attitude.
- the comparison to ""vor probably keeps his rechargeable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wife's neck and a fancy pug roaming the house"" contrasts heavily with the extensive weapon list, suggesting a mocking sentiment towards those who are not as heavily armed.

**step 2: true intention**
- the exaggerated description of the arsenal and combat-ready gear suggests an over-the-top display, likely intended to mock those who do not take extreme measures for home defense.
- the rhetorical question, ""which house would you like to break into?"" adds to the intended sarcasm, as it implies that a criminal would be deterred by the poster’s extreme preparedness.
- the disparaging tone towards ""vor"" for having simpler protections (a phone, a whistle, a pug) implies the true intention is to mock both the criminal and those with less militant approaches to home defense.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of extreme preparedness and boastfulness contrasts with the underlying mockery and sarcasm towards simpler protective measures.
- the clear discrepancy between the excessive detail of weaponry and the casual dismissal of simpler protections highlights the sarcastic nature of the text.

### conclusion:
the input text uses exaggerated and detailed descriptions of weaponry to mock those who rely on less extreme measures for home defense. the sarcastic tone is evident through rhetorical comparisons and the mocking question directed at potential criminals.",1

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.

""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- **surface emotion**: the phrase ""bull."" and ""sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt."" indicate frustration and dismissal of the counter-argument.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions such as ""what? you don't do that?"" implies the speaker doesn't expect a genuine answer but is highlighting a contradiction.
- **language style**: the strong dismissive language (""bull."", ""that dog just doesn't hunt"") shows a sarcastic and confrontational tone.
- **intended meaning**: the speaker is criticizing the inconsistency in the other person's argument regarding moral standards and participation in social change.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: the initial questions suggest a debate or challenge and later statements show contempt and dismissal.
- **true intention**: the rhetorical questions and dismissive statements reveal sarcasm, aiming to ridicule the other person's stance.
- **inference**: the disparity between the seemingly inquisitive start and the aggressive, dismissive conclusion supports the label of sarcasm.

You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish.

You ""interpret"" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

### explanation:
based on an analysis of the given text:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases:** ""sperm,"" ""funding your social security,"" ""stains.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the term ""walking sperm,"" and the dismissive tone suggest a mocking sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of a rhetorical question, ""what will your sperm be doing besides causing stains?"" suggests that this is not a genuine question but one meant to ridicule.
- **language style:** the use of terms like ""walking sperm"" and the implication that someone's future value is limited to ""causing stains"" leverages an exaggerated and condescending tone to mock the addressed person, matt.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface sentiment vs true intention:** the surface sentiment appears dismissive and condescending, while the true intention through rhetorical devices and language style clearly indicates ridicule aimed at the person's future utility.

Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:

   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- **rhetorical devices**: the statement employs a rhetorical comparison between an embryo and a rock to illustrate the absurdity of the initial statement. this exaggeration indicates a mocking tone.
- **language style**: the phrase ""an embryo doesn't even have a point of view"" and the comparison to a rock suggests disdain or criticism towards the idea of attributing a 'point of view' to an embryo. the exaggeration serves to emphasize the perceived absurdity in a sarcastic manner.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""you jsut don't get it,"" ""two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch,"" ""hetero get to go and get married,"" ""man i love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law,"" ""how cruel can you be.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the text conveys frustration, unfairness, and emotional hurt.
- **surface sentiment**: the surface sentiment is one of frustration, grievance, and emotional pain about the unequal treatment.

### step 2: true intention

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### label: sarcastic

the given text exhibits sarcasm for several reasons:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords and phrases: ""scientific rigor,"" ""understand the god of the gaps,"" ""worshipping,"" ""microscopic.""
   - sentimental phrases: the tone superficially appears to be inquiring but carries an underlying critical edge.
   - the use of phrases like ""scientific rigor"" and ""god of the gaps"" implies that the organizations are not truly scientific but rather are worshipping a diminishing deity, bespeaking skepticism and criticism.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the phrase ""scientific rigor"" is used ironically, as it implies doubt about such organizations' scientific credibility. the mention of ""god of the gaps"" becoming ""microscopic"" suggests that the justifications or explanations these organizations provide are increasingly negligible or insignificant.
   - language style: the overall tone is mocking and dismissive, implying these organizations lack true scientific foundation and are clinging to ever-smaller gaps to justify their beliefs.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - comparison: the surface sentiment (inquiring about scientific rigor) contrasts sharply with the true intention (mocking the lack of it and the shrinking significance of their beliefs).
   - analysis: the discrepancy between the surface level (seemingly serious inquiry) and the underlying mockery (implying lack of credibility) clearly indicates sarcasm.

given these elements, the text effectively conveys a sarcastic tone.",1

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""it makes sense only to you"" is likely a rhetorical device indicating that the speaker does not actually believe the addressed person's logic is sound. 
- **language style**: the rest of the passage provides a seemingly factual account, but the context implies that this is meant to undermine the other person's perspective rather than agree with it.

""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

### Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""

Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

### step-by-step reasoning:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: the phrase ""and the moon could fall from the sky"" is a hypothetical, extreme, and highly unlikely event.
- **sentimental phrases**: the sentence adopts a dismissive tone towards the likelihood of another event happening, using a hyperbolic and implausible scenario.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement ""and the moon could fall from the sky, too"" employs hyperbole to emphasize the improbability of another event. this speaks to the use of sarcasm to underline the dismissive and incredulous attitude of the speaker.
- **language style**: by choosing such an exaggerated scenario, the author plays down the actual possibility of the event they are indirectly referring to, indicating dismissiveness and sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the **surface sentiment** initially appears neutral, presenting a hypothetical scenario.
- the **true intention** reveals disbelief and dismissal of another event by employing hyperbolic and sarcastic language. 
- the disparity between the everyday scenario implied and the extremely improbable event (the moon falling from the sky) underlines the sarcastic tone.

given the exaggerated and improbable nature of the statement used to dismiss another situation, this input is clearly **sarcastic**.",1

well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:

   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.

- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""

- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.

- **intended meaning**: the author mocks the idea of absolute inalienable rights by giving an extreme example that leads to a ridiculous scenario. the comments about ""bootlicking"" and ""dropping the rethorics"" further suggest the author's disdain for the preceding argument.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment of incredulity and mockery aligns with the true intention of criticizing or ridiculing the concept being discussed. the use of rhetorical questions and exaggerated examples supports a sarcastic tone.
- **inference**: the overall tone, rhetorical questions, and exaggerations clearly support the label of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.

   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases:**
  - ""yes they sure will"" - can suggest an agreement but the ellipsis (...) indicates a trailing off or an unstated continuation.
  - ""776 accidental deaths last year due to guns"" vs. ""3,402 accidental drownings"" - provides comparative statistics.
  - ""seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns"" - a logical statement based on the above comparisons.
  - ""if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole"" - an insult directed at the reader’s intelligence.
  - ""i will try in the future to keep it down to your level"" - another condescending remark.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:**
  - comparison of accidental deaths due to guns vs. drownings is an appeal to statistics to make a point.
  - describing drowning prevention as more worthy of focus uses logical reasoning but in a snarky context.
  - the phrase ""if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole"" is sarcastic, indicating the speaker thinks the reader lacks intelligence.
  - ""i will try in the future to keep it down to your level"" - direct insult showing sarcasm.

#### step 3: compare and analysis
- surface sentiment: the overall tone suggests an initial agreement or logical assessment, but the latter part makes it clear the speaker is being sarcastic.
- true intention: the use of insults and condescension indicates the primary intention is to mock and belittle the other person's understanding.

- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords and sentimental phrases:** ""troll,"" ""aren't any experts here,"" ""knowledge seems to me to be,"" ""educated and widely read,"" ""ability to reason and an open mind.""
   - although the text starts with a negative term ""troll,"" the following sentences appear complimentary and seem to praise the community for their knowledge, education, and open-mindedness.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** starting with ""and that's why i think you are a troll"" and transitioning into what seems to be a praise for the members' knowledge and reasoning skills indicates a sarcastic tone. if the person truly thought the community possesses such admirable qualities, calling someone a troll in the same breath introduces a disparity suggesting sarcasm.
   - **language style:** the formal and seemingly respectful language used to describe the community's qualities contrasts sharply with the dismissive term ""troll,"" revealing an underlying mocking tone.

3. **compare and analyze:**
   - **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment seems to praise the community for their qualities (knowledge, education, and open-mindedness), the true intention revealed by the juxtaposition with ""troll"" implies that these praises are not genuine. instead, the praise is used sarcastically to mock the person labeled as a ""troll.""

therefore, the label is **sarcastic**.",1

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Label:

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:

   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**

        ","### label: sarcastic

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""i've been redeemed,"" ""by the blood of the lamb,"" ""barbequed lamb,"" ""rare,"" ""yumm,"" ""holy pink bunny,"" ""shroud of turin.""
- sentimental phrases: the tone suggested by ""i've been redeemed, by the blood of the lamb"" could imply a serious or religious experience, but quickly shifts to a humorous “barbequed lamb... rare... yumm...” 
- overall, the tone is playful and humorous.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: use of religious terminology in a flippant manner (""holy pink bunny"" and ""shroud of turin"") suggests a mocking attitude towards the seriousness of the religious tone at the beginning.
- language style: the juxtaposition of singing about redemption and then joking about food and trading holy artifacts indicates that the initial serious tone is not genuine and intended to be humorous or mocking.
- intended meaning: the speaker is making a sarcastic remark about religious salvation, trivializing it by shifting to talking about barbeque and fabled religious artifacts in a comedic way.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment: initially seems to reference religious salvation earnestly but quickly devolves into humor and absurdity.
- true intention: the speaker is mocking the concept of religious salvation by combining it with unrelated and trivial matters.

combined analysis indicates a clear sarcastic tone through the use of humor and trivializing what could be seen as a serious subject.",1
"Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents.

well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

"Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there.",1,"

- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

        ### Input:
        Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people ""having sex in an improper way"" or choosing to ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other"". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""sentient beings,"" ""not really too bad,"" ""having sex in an improper way,"" ""creating a feeling being and then killing it,"" ""it's not punishment,"" ""taking responsibility,"" ""protect against it,"" ""men should have to raise the child,"" ""damper on the 12 year olds social life,"" ""adult soon enough,"" ""bad choices = bad outcome,"" ""abortion is not the answer,"" ""only responsibility can solve the problem,"" ""continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible 'lovers' out there.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the tone appears to be quite direct, discussing serious matters like responsibility, abortion, and the consequences of one's actions. it's predominantly earnest, with few indicators of overt sarcasm or mockery.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: there is use of quotations around phrases like ""having sex in an improper way"" and ""screw each other how they would like to screw each other,"" which might imply a critical attitude towards those phrases.
- **language style**: the language focuses on responsibility and personal accountability, emphasizing the importance of making good decisions and facing the consequences of one's actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author seems sincere in their discussion about the importance of responsibility in the context of reproductive choices. there is a strong emphasis on the negative outcomes of irresponsible behavior and the belief that abortion is not a justification for such behavior.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: predominantly serious and direct, discussing the consequences of actions and responsibility.
- **true intention**: maintains a genuine stance on responsibility and accountability, without much evidence of irony or sarcasm.
- **inference**: there is no significant disparity between the surface sentiment and the true intention. both align towards a serious discourse on responsibility and reproductive choices.

### Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

- **keywords and phrases**: ""do you believe that they should still be prohibited?"", ""how can god hate?"", ""i thought he was true love."", ""i thought he was unknowable."", ""thanks.""
- **sentiment clues**: the tone starts with a seemingly genuine inquiry about legality and constitutionality. this is followed by conflicting statements about the nature of god, which appears to question the logic or consistency of the beliefs being referenced.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions such as ""how can god hate?"" and ""i thought he was true love."" these questions do not seek actual answers but instead suggest that the speaker finds the ideas contradictory or hypocritical.
- **language style**: the phrase ""scratch that-- i thought he was unknowable."" adds an additional layer of sarcasm, as it quickly dismisses one notion to state another, implying that the initial statements were not genuinely held.
- **intended meaning**: the speaker is not sincerely inquiring about beliefs but is instead using the questions to highlight perceived inconsistencies or hypocrisy, often a hallmark of sarcasm.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: the questions appear to seek genuine clarification but become increasingly rhetorical and skeptical.
- **true intention**: the true intention is to mock or criticize the logical contradictions within the beliefs about legality and god's nature.
- **inference**: the shift from genuine inquiry to rhetorical questioning and eventual dismissal strongly indicates a sarcastic intent. the contrast between the surface politeness and underlying mockery confirms the use of sarcasm.

   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

### steps:

- **keywords and phrases**: ""a waist is a terrible thing to mind.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase plays with the well-known saying ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be playful and humorous.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement clearly uses wordplay and punning, as it twists a famous saying for comedic effect.
- **language style**: the humor in the twist implies that the speaker is making a light-hearted joke about indulging in feasts and the consequences on one's waistline, rather than offering a serious moral statement.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning**: the surface humor extends to the true meaning. the statement implies irony through its play on words, suggesting that worrying about your waistline during feasts is trivial or humorous.
- the blending of a serious idiom with a light-hearted twist aligns well with sarcasm through humorous irony.

- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: questioning, skeptical tone.
- **keywords and phrases**: ""protect themselves from burglars,"" ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution,"" ""call others full of fear and mistrust.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be one of incredulity or disbelief towards the gun owners' claims and behavior.

- **language style**: the tone and phrasing suggest mockery and criticism towards the gun owners' justification for having guns.
- **intended meaning**: the sentence seems to imply that it is ironic for people who want guns for extreme reasons (like protecting against burglars or a revolution) to accuse others of being fearful and mistrustful. this points towards a sarcastic critique of the gun owners' stated motivations.

- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.

### steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase ""less than a playstation, of course!"" suggests a comparison that is likely meant to be humorous or dismissive.
   - the use of ""of course!"" often sarcastically emphasizes something that is assumed to be obvious or expected.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the expression likely references something that is comparably less important or less valuable than a playstation, and the ""of course!"" serves to underline the sarcasm, implying that this comparison is trivial or absurd.
   - the casual acceptance of the comparison suggests it’s not meant to be taken literally but to mock the value or significance of the subject being compared.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment appears to be casual and possibly humorous.
   - the true intention reveals the use of sarcasm to either trivialize or mock the comparison.
   - the contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention highlights the sarcasm in the statement.",1
"Once cannot abort a pregnancy if it has not begun.   The morning after pill prevents a pregnancy from ever occuring by preventing the fertilized egg from implanting.   If one considers pregnancy to begin at conception (i.e. fertilization of the egg), then petri dishes are pregnant when eggs are fertilized on them (""conception"") for later IVF.   Do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant?",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
Label:

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**

- keywords: ""sermon,"" ""propaganda,"" ""misinformation,"" ""context,"" ""expert""
- sentimental phrases: ""sure let me have your sermon/propaganda,"" ""i will stick to the context which matches what i have said.""
- the surface sentiment appears critical and condescending, particularly in the use of ""sermon/propaganda"" and ""misinformation.""

### step 2: true intention

- rhetorical devices: the use of ""sure"" at the beginning implies nonchalance or insincerity, indicating that the speaker does not genuinely want to hear the other person's viewpoint.
- language style: the phrase ""your sermon/propaganda of misinformation"" is heavily loaded and sarcastically combines religious and manipulative connotations to diminish the other person's argument.
- the biblical reference seems to be used to assert the speaker's point rather than engage in serious theological discussion, indicating mockery of the opposing viewpoint.

### step 3: compare and analysis

- surface sentiment (critical and condescending) contrasts with the underlying sarcastic tone that diminishes the other person's argument.
- this contrast emphasizes that the speaker is not sincere and is using sarcasm to mock the other person's perspective.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.

### explanation:
in the given input, ""probably because buildings aren't biological or reproductive"":

1. **surface sentiment**:
   - the statement might initially seem like a straightforward factual assertion.

2. **true intention**:
   - the phrase presents a simple fact (""buildings aren't biological or reproductive"") in response to an unstated comparison or claim, which implies that someone may have made a point that the speaker finds absurd or nonsensical.
   - this response seems to be dismissive and aimed at highlighting the triviality or foolishness of the unstated argument.

3. **comparison and analysis**:
   - the surface sentiment is seemingly neutral, but the true intention reveals a mocking or dismissive attitude.
   - this contrast indicates the use of sarcasm, as the speaker is ridiculing the other person's likely flawed logic or comparison.

- the phrase ""how informative"" on the surface appears to be making a positive statement about the level of information provided.

### step 2: true intention
- there are no specific keywords or phrases here indicating identifiable positive sentiment.
- given the brevity and context, the phrase ""how informative"" might actually be intended to convey the opposite of what it states. the lack of additional context suggests that it was said in a tone that implies the opposite—potentially pointing out that the information was not actually informative.
- the rhetorical device in play here could be verbal irony, where the literal meaning is opposite to the intended meaning.

### step 3: compare and analyze

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

steps:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - **keywords and phrases:** ""happier,"" ""did something criminal and broke the law,"" ""admit it.""
   - **sentimental phrases:** the tone created by suggesting happiness over someone committing a crime implies a strong accusation.

2. **true intention:**
   - **rhetorical devices:** the use of phrases like ""in other words"" and ""admit it"" suggests an accusatory and challenging tone, likely not meant to be taken literally.
   - **language style:** the sentence seems to imply irony, suggesting that the happiness derived from someone's criminal actions is unreasonable or hypocritical.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - **surface sentiment:** suggests an accusatory tone by implying happiness over a crime.
   - **true intention:** through the rhetorical questioning and language style, it reveals an underlying mocking or skeptical tone.
   - **inference:** there is a clear discrepancy between the surface accusation and the underlying mockery, leading to the determination of sarcasm.

"Wonder what ""euthanization"" is. Never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

### steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: ""wonder,"" ""never heard of it before,"" ""neither has the dictionary.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the word ""wonder"" indicates curiosity, but the phrase ""never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary"" suggests skepticism and disbelief.
- **overall tone**: the tone seems light-hearted but carries a sense of incredulousness.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""neither has the dictionary"" is a form of hyperbole, as it is unlikely the dictionary has genuinely never heard of ""euthanization.""
- **language style**: the language style is casual, but the exaggeration and disbelief suggest that the speaker is actually criticizing the use or the existence of the term.
- **intent**: the speaker may be implying that the term ""euthanization"" is either made-up or so obscure that it doesn't have an established meaning.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- **surface sentiment vs. true intention**: on the surface, the statement appears to be expressing curiosity and unfamiliarity. however, the true intention, revealed through the sarcastic hyperbole, is to mock the word ""euthanization"" by implying that it is an illegitimate or nonsensical term.
- **inference**: the use of hyperbole and disbelief indicates a sarcastic tone. the actual criticism is hidden behind a facade of curiosity, which aligns well with the characteristics of sarcasm.",1

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

        ### Input:
        So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: the sentence contains phrases like ""anti-choice folk"", ""force us"", ""place us in re-education jails"".
- **surface sentiment**: the language is confrontational and introduces an extreme scenario.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of rhetorical questions, especially those that imply extremely negative actions (re-education jails), suggests exaggeration and hyperbole.
- **language style**: the language is provocative and exaggerated, indicating that the speaker is not sincerely proposing such a scenario but is using it to criticize the opposing viewpoint.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: confrontational and exaggerated.
- **true intention**: by presenting such an extreme and unlikely scenario, the speaker's real intention seems to be highlighting what they perceive as the absurdity or extremity of the anti-choice position.
- the contrast between the extreme surface sentiment and the criticism of the opposing viewpoint through hyperbole and rhetorical questions confirms the use of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### step-by-step analysis:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - **keywords and phrases**: ""so you think"" suggests a questioning tone, while ""zeus and all the other greek gods exist"" points to mythological belief.
   - **sentiment**: the phrasing appears neutral at first glance, as if simply asking a question.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - **rhetorical devices**: the question implies incredulity due to the improbability of believing in ancient mythological gods in the modern world.
   - **language style**: the straightforward question ""so you think zeus and all the other greek gods exist?"" suggests the speaker is mocking the belief, questioning its validity.
   - **underlying meaning**: the intention is to highlight the absurdity of such a belief in a contemporary context, implying that the speaker does not actually believe the person they are addressing thinks this way.

3. **step 3: compare and analyze**
   - **analysis**: the surface sentiment (neutral question) contrasts with the true intention (mockery of the belief in greek gods), revealing the use of sarcasm.
   - **inference**: the apparent neutrality of the question is undercut by the incredulous implication that anyone seriously believes in the ancient greek pantheon.

   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

- keywords: ""what would jesus carry?""
- sentimental phrases: the question appears to be straightforward and inquiries about a hypothetical scenario involving jesus.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the question mimics the phrasing of ""what would jesus do?"" which is a well-known phrase encouraging moral reflection. by substituting ""do"" with ""carry,"" the question evokes a sense of irony or absurdity.
- language style: the alteration of this familiar phrase suggests a possible intent to criticize or mock discussions on what jesus would carry, possibly implying the absurdity of certain material associations with religious or moral figures.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- comparison: the surface sentiment seems to be a simple question, but the true intention, implied through the rhetorical device of altering a known phrase, suggests a mocking or ironic tone.

- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses hyperbolic language (""nothing will ever change your mind"") and an accusatory tone, implying that the audience is close-minded and not evidence-based.
- language style: the statement is structured to critique the firm stance of ""non-darwinists"" as not being influenced by evidence but by a fixed worldview. the use of ""obvious"" and ""nothing will ever"" adds a layer of mockery, implying that the author's view of the audience is negative and unchangeable.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- surface sentiment appears accusatory and dismissive of non-darwinists' views.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### explanation:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
    - keywords: ""suppressing natural behavior,"" ""always the way to go,"" ""stop pooping.""
    - sentimental phrases: the use of ""always the way to go"" is often used in a sarcastic manner to express that the suggested action is actually not advisable.
    - surface emotion: appears supportive or even enthusiastic, but with an underlying tone that seems exaggerated or nonsensical.

2. **step 2: true intention**
    - rhetorical devices: the phrase ""we should also get them to stop pooping"" is a hyperbolic and absurd suggestion. the exaggeration clearly indicates that the speaker does not truly believe it's a good idea to suppress natural behavior, extending the logic to an absurd extreme.
    - language style: the exaggeration and absurdity in the second statement (""we should also get them to stop pooping"") reveal that the intention is not serious support but mocking criticism.
    - true emotion: the speaker is likely criticizing or mocking the idea of suppressing natural behavior by extending the logic to a ridiculous and unnatural conclusion.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
    - surface vs. true meaning: the sentence has a surface appearance of agreement or suggestion, but the exaggerated and absurd nature of the second clause reveals that the true intention is to mock the idea of suppressing natural behavior.
    - final inference: the disparity between the ostensible support in the surface sentiment and the mocking exaggeration in the true intention confirms that the statement is sarcastic.",1

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - **keywords and phrases**: 
     - ""alas"" suggests a tone of lament or mock sadness.
     - ""so who gives a damn?"" implies apathy or indifference.
   - **sentimental phrases**: the language appears dismissive and indifferent at a surface level.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - **rhetorical devices**: 
     - the phrase ""but they are not fetuses"" seems to diminish the importance of the subject compared to fetuses, which is likely a rhetorical comparison.
     - the term ""who gives a damn"" is often used sarcastically to emphasize that something should be important but is being treated with indifference.
   - **language style**: 
     - the use of ""alas"" and ""who gives a damn?"" together strongly indicates a sarcastic tone, mocking the lack of concern for the non-fetuses mentioned.
   - **intended meaning**: the author is criticizing the lack of concern for a certain group (non-fetuses), using sarcasm to highlight what they perceive as misplaced priorities.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment shows indifference and dismissiveness.
   - the true intention reveals that the author uses this tone sarcastically to critique societal priorities.
   - the stark contrast between the apathetic surface sentiment and the critical underlying intention points to a clear use of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.

- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

the input text demonstrates strong indications of sarcasm through the following steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and clues:** ""show us thimble head,"" ""show us or shut up.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the imperative tone implies frustration and dismissiveness.
- overall, the surface sentiment appears aggressive and dismissive.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the repeated commands to ""show us"" suggest that the speaker doubts the other person's ability to prove their point. the phrase ""thimble head"" is a derogatory term aimed at belittling the other person.
- **language style:** the sarcastic tone is evident in the use of belittling language, which suggests mockery rather than a genuine invitation to debate.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment, characterized by aggressive and dismissive language, aligns with the true intention of mockery and criticism.
- this clear congruence confirms the presence of sarcasm, as there is a significant contrast between the overt challenge and the underlying disbelief in the other person's ability to respond effectively.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

### step by step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""in front of or behind a leaf"" – this phrase appears trivial and nonsensical.
- sentiment clues: the simplicity of the question makes it seem oddly specific and a bit absurd, potentially indicating mockery or sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the question is likely rhetorical because it does not seem to seek a genuine answer. the absurdity of the question suggests it might be mocking a previous statement or context.
- language style: the phrasing implies an oversimplification, potentially ridiculing a situation or a person for overthinking or for an unnecessary focus on irrelevant details.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment looks like a simple inquiry, but the absurdity and specificity indicate a possibility of mocking.
- given the often-used sarcastic tone to ridicule someone for stressing over trivial details, it is reasonable to conclude that the question is intended to be sarcastic.",1
As the great Spock said Logic dictates that logic need not apply in this situation.,1,"
### Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - **sentiment clues**: the phrase ""as the great spock said"" indicates an appeal to authority or an attempt at humor.
  - **keywords**: ""logic dictates that logic need not apply"" appears paradoxical and contradictory.
  - **sentimental phrases**: the tone suggests a playful or mocking use of logic.

- **step 2: true intention**
  - **rhetorical devices**: the use of spock, a character known for his logical reasoning, to point out a situation where logic supposedly does not apply is inherently contradictory and intended to highlight the absurdity of the scenario.
  - **language style**: the statement is constructed to invoke irony, as it employs the figure of logic itself to argue against the application of logic, which is inherently illogical.
  - **intended meaning**: the true intention is to sarcastically comment on the absurdity of the situation, using spock as a contrasting symbol of logical reasoning.

- **step 3: compare and analysis**
  - **comparison**: the surface sentiment's playful and paradoxical tone contrasts with the true intention of sarcastically highlighting the illogical nature of the situation.
  - **inference**: the disparity between the seemingly serious appeal to logic and the underlying ironic critique confirms the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        So you're a historian now?   Yes, you are right - the Civil War was fought to keep the union in tact. But, it is also a fact that Abraham Lincoln, the Commander in Chief of the Union Army, did not believe that the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   According to who? Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness, it in no way follows that all men are not created equal.   Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""so you're a historian now?"", ""yes, you are right"", ""it is also a fact"", ""according to who?"", ""someone who actually had knowledge about the civil war"", ""i don't expect you to"", ""the reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction"".
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""so you're a historian now?"" in a dismissive manner, and the phrase ""yes, you are right"" which appears to acknowledge but actually sets up for disagreement or correction.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the opening question ""so you're a historian now?"" is sarcastic, intended to belittle the recipient's knowledge on the topic. the phrase ""yes, you are right"" is immediately followed by a correction, suggesting that the initial acknowledgment is insincere. other phrases like ""according to who?"", ""i don't expect you to"", and ""someone who actually had knowledge about the civil war"" imply disbelief or mockery towards the recipient’s claim.
- **language style**: the use of rhetorical questions and dismissive comments points towards an underlying attempt to mock or belittle the other person's knowledge and argument.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface sentiment**: appears argumentative with some acknowledgments of fact but questioning of sources and knowledge.
- **true intention**: reveals that the statements are not meant to genuinely concede any points but rather to mock and question the recipient’s knowledge and assertions.

"Try the link. You've done the 'name calling', at least you could be honest about what you are doing.",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

"So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.

   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

        ### Input:
        So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.   And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. ""POOF! Goddidit!"" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,

steps:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - keywords and phrases: ""so your claim is that the laws of physics have changed?"", ""poof! goddidit!"", ""poof the ark into existence,"" ""first thing noah did was to get drunk.""
   - the language throughout the passage is detailed and analytical at first glance but contains phrases that indicate skepticism and mockery.

2. **true intention:**
   - rhetorical devices: the use of terms like ""poof! goddidit!"" and questioning the absurdity of certain ideas signal sarcasm and mockery towards the argument being responded to.
   - language style: there is a clear mocking tone in questioning the practicality and physical limitations of wood in constructing a large ark, and the sarcastic suggestion that god could have simply ""poofed"" things into existence.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment appears analytical and detailed, but upon closer analysis, the true intention is revealed to be sarcastic. the use of highly exaggerated rhetorical questions and mock phrases like ""poof! goddidit!"" suggests a dismissive and mocking stance towards the original claim.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

- language style: the transition from discussing responsibilities and societal issues to the stark ""just drop dead?"" suggests frustration and mockery.
- intended meaning: the speaker is criticizing the apparent lack of viable solutions for significant social issues and using sarcasm to emphasize the seriousness of the problem.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

        ","### step by step analysis:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - **keywords**: ""novel idea,"" ""just a thought.""
   - **sentimental phrases**: ""how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes"" and ""improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having upps in the first place?""
   - the expression ""novel idea"" and ""just a thought"" sound like a suggestion or a proposition presented in a polite manner.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""here's a novel idea"" is often used to introduce a statement that the speaker believes should be obvious or has been ignored. it implies a critique that abstinence programs are ineffective and that more practical measures (like better access to birth control) should be adopted.
   - **language style**: the suggestion that the right ""improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having upps in the first place"" contrasts with the reality of what is commonly promoted by the political right, highlighting the ineffectiveness of current strategies.
   - the phrase ""just a thought"" is a rhetorical device implying that the suggestion is common sense yet overlooked.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - **surface vs. true meaning**: the surface sentiment appears to be a polite suggestion, but the true intention reveals a critique of the ineffective abstinence programs with an implied suggestion to adopt more scientifically supported methods.
   - the contrast between the seemingly polite suggestion and the underlying critique of current policies is a hallmark of sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.

- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

- overall, the surface sentiment appears to acknowledge humor and concede a good point.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement ""they should have i am just a theory written on them"" contains irony. the implication is that the original point is actually not taken seriously.
- language style: the use of ""otherwise kids will regard them as fact and then where will we be?"" suggests a hypothetical extreme consequence that highlights the absurdity of the initial suggestion.
- true intention: the speaker likely does not genuinely believe that theories need disclaimers. the suggestion underscores the perceived silliness of the original argument.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the initial surface sentiment of laughing and conceding is undercut by the ironic and hyperbolic nature of the suggestion.
- the sarcasm is clear through the juxtaposition of the laughing response and the exaggerated suggestion, revealing a mocking tone towards the idea.

""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

        ","### label: sarcastic

the sentiment in the input appears to use rhetorical devices and provocative language, clearly implying that the speaker thinks george bush is responsible for the deaths of many children in iraq. the structure and context suggest sarcasm rather than a straightforward statement.",1
And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies.,1,"
### Example:
Input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**

- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### surface sentiment:
- **sentiment clues**: the phrase ""oh my stars and garters"" is an antiquated and somewhat humorous exclamation that suggests surprise or astonishment.
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""he actually admitted"" could indicate a positive recognition of someone's admission, combined with the surprise indicated earlier.

### true intention:
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""the real issue"" is in quotes, often used to imply irony, suggesting that the speaker might not believe it is the real issue or is mocking the admission.
- **language style**: the overall language style, including the exaggerated and old-fashioned exclamation, hints at mockery or disbelief rather than genuine surprise or positive sentiment.

### comparison and analysis:
- **surface vs. true intention**: while the surface sentiment appears to be of genuine surprise or astonishment, the use of quotes around ""the real issue"" and the exaggerated language style suggest that the speaker is mocking or being sarcastic about the admission.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**

- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Label:

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

### steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: the repetitions of ""watch yourself"" and ""watch it"" along with the excessive ellipses (........) suggest a warning or caution.
- **surface emotion**: the statement appears to give a serious and direct warning, potentially indicating concern or threat.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the repetition and the use of ellipses can be interpreted in multiple ways, but there is no clear indication of irony, exaggeration, or other common markers of sarcasm in the language itself.
- **language style**: the style, while potentially dramatic due to the repetition and ellipses, does not clearly imply a mocking or insincere tone.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **analysis**: given the lack of apparent rhetorical devices or ironic tone, the statement seems to be a straightforward caution or warning. the surface sentiment aligns with the likely true intention.

"You believe that your interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than his, and he believes that his interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than yours. This is quite simple, but that's never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.   No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   ""Concise and readable"" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his ""citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts.""   I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the ""on"" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this ""power,"" too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble ""stomaching"" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc.

### Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

        ### Input:
        and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:

- **sentimental phrases:** phrases like ""studies will say whatever the funder wants"" and ""get your study participants in a bar"" indicate skepticism and a dismissive attitude toward the methodology of the study.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of hyperbole and exaggerated examples like ""raging alcoholics"" and ""sexaholics"" to make a point implies that the author is critically mocking the design and integrity of the studies.
- **language style:** the language is critical and skeptical, strongly implying that studies on gay men are unreliable and manipulated.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment appears skeptical and dismissive about the integrity of studies involving gay men, the true intention, highlighted by exaggeration and hyperbole, strongly indicates that the speaker is mocking or criticizing these studies and their methodologies.

""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

step 1: surface sentiment:
- keywords: ""i love babies""
- sentimental phrases: ""they're delicious""
- the surface sentiment starts as positive with ""i love babies,"" which is a commonly affectionate statement. however, this is immediately followed by ""they're delicious,"" suggesting something jarring and absurd.

step 2: true intention:
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""they're delicious"" is clearly not meant to be taken literally, as it implies cannibalism, which is a shocking and inappropriate concept used here to create humor through absurdity.
- language style: the use of outrageous irony indicates that the speaker is making a joke, likely to criticize or mock the previous statement ""i love babies"" or to make a humorous and sarcastic remark.

step 3: comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment of seeming affection is starkly contrasted by the absurd and shocking follow-up saying babies are ""delicious.""
- this contrast and the jarring shift from a seemingly affectionate statement to an outrageous remark indicate a clear use of sarcasm.",1

- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**

- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: the use of ""*gee* *gasp* *amazement* *realization*"" suggests excitement or astonishment.
- **keywords**: ""neither are yours"" has an element of negativity or dismissal.
- **sentimental phrases**: the asterisks and words within them seem dramatic and exaggerated, which is an indication of sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the exaggerated use of words in asterisks denotes mock astonishment.
- **language style**: ""neither are yours"" is dismissive and likely to be intended to undercut the opposite perspective. the dramatization of the following words suggests that the speaker is ridiculing or mocking someone.
- **intended meaning**: the speaker is likely mocking someone by sarcastically expressing exaggerated surprise or disbelief.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment of astonishment indicated by the exaggerated words contrasts with the true intention of mocking or ridiculing someone.
- **analysis**: the surface level dramatization combined with the dismissive context of ""neither are yours"" strongly suggests that the entire statement is sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**

- **keywords and sentimental phrases:** ""only a brain...no person,"" ""i deny that a level of intelligence is needed to deserve rights,"" ""perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again,"" ""white folks are the only humans with white skin.""
- **sentimental phrases:** ""perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again"" is a provocative statement that invokes historical racial discrimination. the exaggerated and contentious phrase ""white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife"" suggests a mockery of the argumentation.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of exaggeration and extreme examples (""only white folks again"" and ""only humans with white skin"") points to hyperbole intended to criticize or highlight the absurdity of selective application of fundamental rights.
- **language style:** the phrase ""right"" being repeated highlights a questioning of the validity or application of such fundamental rights, suggesting the speaker finds the original assertion problematic or inconsistent.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.

    - the intention appears to be a straightforward (albeit moralistic) statement or commentary on human behavior, emphasizing the point that immoral actions are often easier, but not necessarily right.
    - the language used is clear and direct without the hyperbole or sardonic tone typically found in sarcasm.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
    - there is no noticeable disparity between surface sentiment and true intention. both align well in conveying a moral viewpoint without irony or exaggerated insincerity.
    - the overall tone suggests a serious discussion about moral choices rather than engaging in sarcastic mockery.",0

### Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

   - sentimental phrases: ""oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? gasp!"" suggests exaggerated surprise. this exaggeration is a clue towards sarcasm.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - rhetorical devices: the use of ""oh no"" and ""gasp!"" in response to an ""open minded church that doesn't hate"" is obviously not a genuine concern but aims to mock the idea that an open-minded church is a bad thing.
   - language style: the phrase ""their not closes binded right wing bigots"" is dismissive and intended to ridicule the notion that being open-minded and tolerant is negative.
   - true emotion: the author is mocking the idea that churches should be closed-minded and intolerant, and ridiculing those who think such churches should be criticized for being different.

3. **compare and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment suggests exaggerated surprise and concern.
   - true intention, revealed through rhetorical questioning and ridicule, shows that the author is mocking the criticism of open-minded churches.

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""jesus!"", ""another scientific illiterate.""
- **sentimental indications**: the exclamation ""jesus!"" and the phrase ""another scientific illiterate"" indicate frustration and annoyance.
- the rest of the sentence that explains the scientific method in a seemingly earnest tone acts to underline the speaker’s frustration with the perceived ignorance of others.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""jesus!"" and ""another scientific illiterate"" as opening phrases reveals that the statement is directed towards someone the speaker deems ignorant.
- **language style**: the ongoing explanation of scientific principles suggests that the speaker feels the need to educate the other person from a foundational level, which reinforces their frustration and a sense of superiority.
- the juxtaposition of the exclamation with the methodical explanation indicates a layering of emotions, primarily annoyance or disparagement masked as a patient explanation.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment**: the initial frustration and disparagement are clearly evident through loaded phrases.
- **true intention**: the earnest explanation of scientific facts juxtaposed with the dismissive opening lines sends a mixed message, indicating that the speaker is both angry and perhaps mocking the other person’s perceived lack of understanding.
- **inference**: there's a clear discrepancy between the seemingly factual explanation and the underlying disdain. this indicates sarcasm, as the detailed explanation seems to be a way to mockingly highlight the other person's ignorance.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        How can they? If they exist in the mind and not on there own, then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws (Bivalency, Involution, Idempotency,Identity, (Non-)Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Contraction, Commutatively, DeMorgan's, Associatively, Distributivity) and they stop existing? Or I could say, ""hofflenosh"" is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either. If is existed only in the mined, it would not be absolute. It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist.

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **sentiment clues**: question marks and rhetorical questions throughout the paragraph.
- **keywords**: ""concept"", ""stupid"", ""does not exist"", ""absolute"", ""opinion"".
- **sentimental phrases**: phrases like ""hofflenosh is a concept i think is stupid"" and ""the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept"" suggest a dismissive or critical tone.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of hypothetical scenarios, rhetorical questions, and extreme examples (e.g., comparing logical laws to a made-up concept like ""hofflenosh"").
- **language style**: the exaggerated hypothetical scenarios used to critique the notion that logical laws can simply be dismissed if they are not believed in.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that logical laws are subjective and can be dismissed at will. the tone and structure are designed to mock this idea.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment comes across as critical and dismissive, while the true intention is to mock the notion that logical laws can be subjective and non-absolute.
- **inference**: the critical and dismissive language, combined with the evident mockery in the exaggerated examples, leads to the conclusion that the text is sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

 Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.

- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

what is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?

### steps:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and sentimental phrases**: the phrase is framed as a question, using ""your theory"" and ""foot fetish gene"".
- **surface emotion**: curiosity or interest.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the question format may imply curiosity, but the topic itself (""foot fetish gene"") and the casual way it is asked suggest that the speaker is likely not serious.
- **language style**: the specific mention of a ""foot fetish gene"" can be considered as invoking a sense of absurdity or humor, and ""what is your theory"" implies that the concept itself is somewhat ridiculous.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of mild curiosity contrasts with the inherent absurdity or humor in the question, which more likely implies sarcasm.
- the absurdity of the topic makes it improbable that the question is genuine, indicating a sarcastic tone.

- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:

   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- **keywords and phrases:** ""laws of the peoples republic of kalifornia,"" ""citizens into prey,"" ""self defense is not allowed.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""peoples republic of kalifornia"" sarcastically likens california to a communist regime.
- the tone is critical and mocking toward california's laws.

**step 2: true intention:**
- **rhetorical devices:** the term ""peoples republic of kalifornia"" is a hyperbolic and sarcastic reference to criticize california's laws by comparing them to those of an authoritarian regime.
- **language style:** the exaggeration that laws are aimed at making citizens ""prey"" and the claim that ""self defense is not allowed"" suggests a mocking and disdainful attitude.
- the author seems to be criticizing california's strict laws and regulations, particularly regarding self-defense, by using exaggerated and sarcastic language.

**step 3: compare and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment is critical and mocking, using hyperbolic and sarcastic comparisons (california to a communist regime, citizens as prey).
- the true intention confirms this critical stance through exaggerated and disdainful language.
- the consistent use of mocking and sarcastic language throughout the statement indicates sarcasm.

thus, the overall conclusion aligns with the label of sarcasm.",1
"So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?   Wouldn't it just be easier, as well as more likely, for an emotionally disturbed student to just illegally bring a gun to school and kill their teacher, rather than waiting for a legal alternative to commit murder and go to prison anyway?",1,"
### Example:

""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""how the hell,"" ""narrow it down to three,"" ""top ten is fierce.""
- sentimental phrases: ""how the hell"" indicates surprise and possibly frustration.
- surface sentiment suggests frustration or disbelief at the idea of narrowing down the options.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of ""how the hell"" amplifies the disbelief, suggesting that the task is extremely difficult or impossible.
- language style: the word choice (""how the hell"") and phrase construction suggest that the speaker finds the idea of narrowing it down to three absurd or impossible.
- the sentence seems to mock the feasibility of the task by highlighting the competitiveness of the top ten.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (frustration or disbelief) matches with the true intention (finding the task absurd or impossible).
- the statement appears to exaggerate the difficulty as a way of mocking the idea of narrowing it down to three, indicating sarcasm.

### Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

Label: sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

Label:

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

Steps:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input:

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

Label:
sarcastic

 Example:
Input: gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

Steps:
1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        All forms of life? Animal life? Plant life? The mold growing in your bathroom?

        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords:** ""all forms of life? animal life? plant life? the mold growing in your bathroom?""
- **sentimental phrases:** the use of a list ending with a seemingly trivial item (mold in the bathroom) suggests a less serious tone.
- **clues:** the progression from significant categories of life (animals, plants) to a trivial one (bathroom mold) hints at a mocking or sarcastic sentiment.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the listing and the escalation to an absurd example (""mold growing in your bathroom"") imply exaggeration used for effect.
- **language style:** rhetorical questions with an increasingly absurd focus suggest that the statement is not purely informative but is meant to highlight the perceived absurdity of considering ""all forms of life"" in this context.
- **deduction:** the true intention appears to be mocking the broad scope of ""all forms of life"" by including trivial forms like mold, highlighting the implausibility or absurdity of the original statement.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface level appears to be questioning and potentially informative, but the sarcastic twist becomes apparent when trivial examples are included.
- **inference:** the tone and structure indicate sarcasm, as the final example undermines the seriousness of considering ""all forms of life.""

"You need to experiment with the notion that you will be sexually attracted to your own sex. After you're done, come back and report your findings!",1,"
### Example:
Input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
Label:

 Example:
Input:
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

Steps:
**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

 Example:
Input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Steps:
**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: ""experiment with the notion,"" ""sexually attracted to your own sex,"" ""report your findings.""
- **surface emotion**: the tone may superficially seem like encouragement or an academic suggestion to conduct an experiment.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion to ""experiment with the notion that you will be sexually attracted to your own sex"" is intended to be provocative and absurd.
- **language style**: the entire premise is over-the-top and unrealistic, which indicates a mocking or sarcastic tone rather than a genuine suggestion.
- **true emotion**: the speaker seems to be using satire to ridicule the idea being presented.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment of apparent encouragement to conduct an experiment contrasts sharply with the far-fetched and absurd nature of the suggestion.
- **inference**: the disparity between the seemingly serious suggestion and the clearly mocking intention indicates sarcasm.

Steps:
step 1: surface sentiment

   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**

   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.
