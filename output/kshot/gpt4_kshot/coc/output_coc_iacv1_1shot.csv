### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the phrase ""and the answer is: we don't know. maybe it came from nowhere. maybe it was created. we don't know."" repeats the phrase ""we don't know"" with assertions like ""maybe it came from nowhere"" and ""maybe it was created."" it contains elements of uncertainty but the repetition and the framing suggest a stronger underlying sentiment.

- **step 2: true intention**
  - the exaggerated repetition of ""we don't know"" and the speculative sentences (""maybe it came from nowhere. maybe it was created."") suggest a rhetorical device: irony. the speaker implies that the lack of information or uncertainty is frustrating or absurd, which fits with a sarcastic tone.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - the surface sentiment shows repetition and uncertainty, while the true intention indicates sarcasm through exaggeration and irony. the mismatch between the straightforward presentation and the underlying frustration or mockery supports a sarcastic interpretation.

### conclusion:
the surface sentiment indicates uncertainty, but the true intention reveals sarcastic irony. thus, the phrase is classified as sarcastic.",1

From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that. Your clearly very wrong.,0,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
the example input involves a discussion about sex, contraception, and abortion legislation. it debates the impact of criminalizing abortion on women's well-being and questions the viewpoint of those who wish to legislate against it.

### example input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- keywords: ""very clear,"" ""did not,"" ""clearly very wrong.""
- sentimental phrases: the repeated emphasis (""very clear,"" ""did not,"" ""clearly very wrong"") suggests a strong, vehement tone. the capitalization of ""did not"" emphasizes denial.
- the sentiment appears confrontational and emphatic.

### step 2: deduce true intention
- the passage disputes a claim by asserting a strong denial and using emphatic language.
- the emphasis and repetition suggest the speaker is confident and possibly condescending towards the other party.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- surface sentiment: confrontational and emphatic.
- true intention: to dismiss the other person's claim by emphasizing factual inaccuracy.
- there is an element of mockery or derision, especially with ""your clearly very wrong,"" which could imply an underlying sarcastic tone by belittling the other person.

### conclusion
considering the confrontational and derisive tone, as well as the emphasis on the other party being ""clearly very wrong,"" it indicates a sarcastic undertone.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
we have a provided example to which we must ascertain and refine the reasoning for why the label ""not sarcastic"" applies.

### example input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.
- terms like ""pre-existing fitness landscape,"" ""converge on similar endpoints,"" and ""many parallels,"" are scientific and factual in nature.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be educational and explanatory.
- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:
given the neutral and informative nature of both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the text, the correct label for the example input is conclusively ""not sarcastic.""

### breif response:
the example input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" because the text is neutral and informative, with no rhetorical devices or ironic language to indicate sarcasm. it sincerely explains the similarities between a biological process and a docking simulation, making the label accurate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

step-by-step reasoning:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the text includes seemingly positive and empathetic phrases like ""very unusual and distressing story,"" ""unfortunate for her,"" and ""have to live with that disability."" these phrases might suggest genuine concern.
   
2. **true intention:**
   - the phrase ""wow. a very unusual and distressing story, and probably why saline abortions are no longer used"" implies a tone of irony, especially when following it up with ""it is very unfortunate for her to have to live with that disability."" the use of ""wow"" at the beginning can be interpreted as a sarcastic exclamation rather than genuine astonishment. the overall structure and flow of the sentences convey a mocking undertone about the situation, rather than sincere concern.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment might initially seem empathetic, but when analyzing the true intention and tone, it reveals an underlying sarcasm. the introductory ""wow"" and the detailed commentary suggest an ironic and mocking commentary on the subject matter.

the final label is ""sarcastic"" because the apparent sentiment of empathy is undermined by the ironic and mocking tone, indicating sarcasm.",1

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**
the task is to determine whether the given input is sarcastic or not based on a systematic reasoning process.

**example input:**
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

**final conclusion:**
the input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" based on the consistent critical sentiment and lack of sarcastic elements.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input initially seems to express support for women but then shifts to a defense of a different issue (the child who has no choice).
- phrases like ""you stand up for women"" followed by ""who's being discriminatory here?"" evoke a confrontational and accusatory tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the structure and language suggest that the speaker is questioning or undermining the sincerity or validity of standing up for women by presenting an alternative concern (the child who has no choice).
- the rhetorical question ""who's being discriminatory here?"" implies that the act of standing up for women is being presented as potentially discriminatory itself, which is a sarcastic way to accuse the other party of hypocrisy or selective concern.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the surface sentiment seems confrontational and accusatory, which aligns well with sarcastic intent.
- the true intention deduced in step 2 indicates a mocking or undermining stance, which contrasts with the literal meaning in the beginning (""you stand up for women"").
- the contrast and the rhetorical question together suggest a sarcastic tone, as they imply criticism and irony rather than a straightforward statement.

**final conclusion:**
the input is labeled ""sarcastic"" due to the presence of rhetorical questioning and implied criticism, which are key indicators of sarcasm.",1

### Example:
**context**: assigning a not sarcastic label to an example input.

**example input**: 
""yes. (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)""

**example label**: 
not sarcastic

**reasoning process**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""yes.""
- clues: the phrase ""yes"" indicates a straightforward affirmation. 

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

**conclusion**:
the surface sentiment ""yes"" is sincere and matches the true intention of the statement. hence, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- keywords: ""can't your religion survive a little mockery?"" and ""i can understand why you're worried"" and ""your religion being so ridiculous and all.""
- clues: the question and statements here seem to criticize or challenge the resilience and validity of a religion.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of a rhetorical question, ""can't your religion survive a little mockery?"" suggests that the speaker is questioning the strength or legitimacy of the religion. the phrase ""your religion being so ridiculous and all"" is clearly derogatory and dismissive.
- language style: the language is confrontational and mocking, aiming to belittle the subject.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is critical and insulting, masked as a question and a statement of understanding.
- the true intention is to mock and belittle the religion being spoken about, which aligns with the characteristics of sarcasm.

**conclusion**:
the statement ""your religion being so ridiculous and all"" clearly conveys sarcasm. hence, the final label should be ""sarcastic.""

### context:
we have a provided example to which we must ascertain and refine the reasoning for why the label ""not sarcastic"" applies.

### example input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.
- terms like ""pre-existing fitness landscape,"" ""converge on similar endpoints,"" and ""many parallels,"" are scientific and factual in nature.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be educational and explanatory.
- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:
given the neutral and informative nature of both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the text, the correct label for the example input is conclusively ""not sarcastic.""

### breif response:
the example input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" because the text is neutral and informative, with no rhetorical devices or ironic language to indicate sarcasm. it sincerely explains the similarities between a biological process and a docking simulation, making the label accurate.

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the input text seems to be one of questioning or seeking clarification.
- keywords like ""contract,"" ""move cytoplasm,"" and ""transport oxygen within itself"" are scientific and factual in nature, suggesting an inquiry into biological processes.
- there are no obvious sentimental phrases or emojis that indicate sarcasm directly.

**step 2: true intention**
- to deduce the true intention, it is critical to look for any rhetorical devices or language styles that might indicate irony or sarcasm.
- the phrasing of the question (""so individual cells contract to move cytoplasm around and to transport oxygen within itself?"") could suggest genuine curiosity or a desire for confirmation.
- however, the structure and phrasing can also imply a skeptical or incredulous tone, as if the speaker is questioning the plausibility of the statement, which can be a subtle form of sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- when comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, the apparent neutral, factual nature of the question aligns with genuine inquiry but the incredulous tone could also hint at sarcasm.
- the absence of clear indicators of irony makes the judgment less straightforward.

### conclusion:
given the dual possibilities in tone—both genuine inquiry and mild skepticism—the surface sentiment leans slightly towards a questioning attitude with an undertone that might suggest sarcasm. this nuance is enough to label the input text as ""sarcastic"".

### Example:
### context:
the example input involves a discussion about sex, contraception, and abortion legislation. it debates the impact of criminalizing abortion on women's well-being and questions the viewpoint of those who wish to legislate against it.

### example input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the surface sentiment shows signs of skepticism and mockery, especially around the exaggerated importance attributed to the ""religious right.""
- the true intention further underscores this skepticism by questioning the source of the ""extra votes,"" hinting at an ironic disbelief.

- language style: the initial statement, ""this also applies to tapeworms,"" seems exaggerated and is likely used to make a point through hyperbole, indicating sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

- **sentimental phrases:** the phrases describe events and conditions in a factual manner but also use vivid and slightly exaggerated language regarding unpleasant conditions.
- **emojis:** none present.

### step 2: true intention

- **rhetorical devices:** the sentence uses the word ""actually"" multiple times, which can imply a corrective or clarifying tone, often a marker of sarcasm. furthermore, the vivid and extreme descriptions (e.g., ""pestilent insects winging about,"" ""biting and stinging,"" ""feces and urine infested bilge"") suggest a level of exaggeration and absurdity that aligns with sarcasm.

### step 3: compare and analysis

- the **surface sentiment** appears to be one of factual detail but is layered with vivid and negative descriptions. this contrasts with a straightforward factual tone and suggests an underlying mocking intent.
- the **true intention** is to criticize and mock the practicalities of the ark story, indicated by the exaggerated and unpleasant imagery.

### Example:
**context:** 

assigning sarcasm labels to text involves analyzing both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the words. 

**example input:**
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

**example label:** not sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

### Example:
**context**: assigning a not sarcastic label to an example input.

**example input**: 
""yes. (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)""

**example label**: 
not sarcastic

**reasoning process**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""yes.""
- clues: the phrase ""yes"" indicates a straightforward affirmation. 

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

**conclusion**:
the surface sentiment ""yes"" is sincere and matches the true intention of the statement. hence, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

**step by step reasoning**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""bwahahahahhaah!"", ""amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant"", ""psht""
- clues: the initial laughter and dismissive ""psht"" suggest a mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
the example input involves a discussion about sex, contraception, and abortion legislation. it debates the impact of criminalizing abortion on women's well-being and questions the viewpoint of those who wish to legislate against it.

### example input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""more guns, more concealed carry,"" ""violent crime and murder is down,"" ""how can these studies be credible.""
- sentimental phrases: the use of ""humm"" and the phrase ""how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct"" implies skepticism.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the text appears to present a paradox, implying that increased access to guns (concealed carry) supposedly leading to lower crime rates contradicts the findings of certain studies.
- the phrase ""how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct"" questions the validity of the studies in a rhetorical way, suggesting the speaker is mocking or doubting the studies rather than genuinely inquiring.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: skeptical and possibly mocking.
- true intention: the passage aims to ridicule or question the credibility of the studies, highlighting a perceived inconsistency in data.
- the surface and true intentions indicate an element of contradiction and irony, which are typical of sarcasm.

reasoning process:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text appears to carry an explanatory and somewhat condescending tone.
   - the use of the word ""actually"" at the beginning of the text indicates a corrective or pedantic tone.
   - the phrase ""obviously"" suggests that the information being provided should already be known, which often implies a sarcastic undertone of belittling the reader's knowledge.

2. true intention:
   - while the text provides factual information about selection and reproductive rates, its presentation implies a slight mockery or dismissal of the reader's understanding.
   - the intention seems to be to correct or teach the reader in a way that might appear obvious or elementary to the writer, suggesting sarcasm rather than a purely educational intent.

3. comparison and analysis:
   - the combination of the corrective tone with the word ""obviously"" points towards the likelihood of sarcasm.
   - the apparent goal is not merely to inform but to assert superiority in a somewhat mocking manner, aligning with sarcastic communication.

**context:**
the task is to determine whether the given input is sarcastic or not based on a systematic reasoning process.

**example input:**
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was “not possible?to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.

        No. You're missing the point. Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.   Al Gore is a shyster...just like Michael Moore. Documentary, my XXX!   Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before. Think it could be resulting from their industrial age?   ...and he's pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do. Check the stats on his personal home. Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.   He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly, yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California.   We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills). This fact does not diminish the lies told by Al Gore...the ones that got him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, both of which become more meaningless each year.   Gore, a shyster   http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sh...d-return-oscar   http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php?extend.29   1.	The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming. The Government's expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.   2.	The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was “not possible?to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.	The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.   5.	The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.   11.	The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand. The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.   Stay tuned as the UK High Court's final ruling may impose additional restrictions on teaching An Inconvenient Truth in classes.

### Example:
**context**: assigning a not sarcastic label to an example input.

**example input**: 
""yes. (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)""

**example label**: 
not sarcastic

**reasoning process**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""yes.""
- clues: the phrase ""yes"" indicates a straightforward affirmation. 

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

**conclusion**:
the surface sentiment ""yes"" is sincere and matches the true intention of the statement. hence, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""again with the common sense"", ""my common sense is appalled by yours"", ""your arguements all show a general lack of study""
- clues: use of phrases like ""again"", ""common sense"", and a direct critique indicates a confrontation or disagreement.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: 
  - ""again with the common sense"" indicates frustration or dismissal, often seen in sarcastic remarks.
  - ""my common sense is appalled by yours"" uses hyperbole, implying the writer finds the other's argument very lacking.
  - the bill maher quote in the context of ""intelligent design debate"" uses sarcasm to belittle one side of the argument by calling it ""retarded"".
- language style: direct, critical, and dismissive tone, all common in sarcastic statements.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is negative and dismissive.
- the true intention behind the statements and quotes reveals a disdainful attitude toward the other person's argument, using sarcasm as a tool to emphasize their disagreement and disapproval.

### Example:
context: assigning sarcasm labels to textual inputs.

example input:
everything basically. you're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. they decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. and canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or outright illegal depending on just where you live.

example label: not sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

conclusion: based on the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention, the text should be labeled as ""not sarcastic.""

reasoning process:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses a questioning tone with phrases that sound incredulous or mocking, such as ""what other theories?"" and ""you are actually on a board of education?""
   - the response includes skeptical language like ""i notice there was no mention"" and ""evolution is a more secure theory than gravity.""

2. true intention:
   - the true intention seems to be to criticize and mock the other party for not providing explanations and implying incompetence or ignorance.
   - the rhetorical questions and the sarcastic comparison of evolution to gravity suggest the speaker does not genuinely believe what they are stating literally and is instead using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity.

3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention point toward sarcasm. the rhetorical questions and tone all contribute to an overall impression of mockery and disbelief.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
the example input involves a discussion about sex, contraception, and abortion legislation. it debates the impact of criminalizing abortion on women's well-being and questions the viewpoint of those who wish to legislate against it.

### example input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""natural selection,"" ""darwin,"" ""anti-evolutionists,"" ""how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma,"" ""micro-evolve.""
- sentimental phrases: the tone seems informative initially but shifts to a critical and mocking tone, particularly regarding the concept of fitting animals on the ark and the sudden acceptance of ""micro-evolution.""

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is providing an explanation of natural selection and anti-evolutionist views, but it also mocks and criticizes the latter.
- phrases like ""how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma"" and ""now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science"" suggest a sarcastic tone, as it seems to ridicule the inconsistency and convenience of anti-evolutionist arguments.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: partly informative but mixed with critical and mocking elements.
- true intention: to highlight and criticize the contradictions in anti-evolutionist thinking by using sarcastic remarks.
- the surface and true intention reveal a use of sarcasm, particularly in how the anti-evolutionist views are discussed.

  - both the surface sentiment (neutral) and the true intention (genuine and straightforward) align. no contrast suggesting sarcasm is present.

### conclusion:
based on the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention, the phrase ""or helpful."" is classified as not sarcastic.

### Example:
**context:** 

assigning sarcasm labels to text involves analyzing both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the words. 

**example input:**
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

**example label:** not sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention without any use of rhetorical devices suggesting sarcasm leads to the conclusion that the text is not sarcastic.

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
the surface sentiment of the context seems critical and somewhat accusative. phrases such as ""you are getting to a more complicated area,"" ""it just seems like,"" and ""a dangerous precedent"" reflect a questioning and cautionary tone.

**step 2 - true intention:**
the true intention of the text appears to be a serious critique and reflection on arguments related to abortion and the valuation of human life. the speaker is pointing out a perceived flaw in the reasoning related to abortion and the hierarchy of human worth, suggesting that prioritizing the woman's value over the fetus could lead to a slippery slope.

the surface sentiment of being critical matches the true intention of seriously questioning and warning about potential implications. there does not appear to be any irony, exaggeration, or contradictory statements that would indicate sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention without any use of typical sarcasm indicators leads to the conclusion that the text is not sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the phrase includes expressions like ""oh, now we're getting somewhere,"" ""explain more, please,"" and ""evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too."" while on the surface, these phrases might seem positive or polite, there is a stark tone of impatience or frustration conveyed through the repetition of ""oh"" and ""please.""

- **step 2: true intention**
  - the language style, rhetorical devices, and context are crucial here. there is a hint of mockery and insincerity in the way the speaker frames their request for more explanation and evidence. the repetitive nature of ""oh"" and the phrasing suggest an exaggerated disbelief or disapproval, indicative of sarcasm.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - when comparing the surface sentiment (which appears superficially polite) and the true intention (which is likely frustrated and mocking), a clear contrast emerges. the exaggerated and skeptical tone gives the phrase a sarcastic undertone.

### conclusion:
based on the contrast between the polite surface sentiment and the mocking true intention, the phrase is classified as ""sarcastic.""",1

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
we have a provided example to which we must ascertain and refine the reasoning for why the label ""not sarcastic"" applies.

### example input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.
- terms like ""pre-existing fitness landscape,"" ""converge on similar endpoints,"" and ""many parallels,"" are scientific and factual in nature.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be educational and explanatory.
- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:
given the neutral and informative nature of both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the text, the correct label for the example input is conclusively ""not sarcastic.""

### breif response:
the example input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" because the text is neutral and informative, with no rhetorical devices or ironic language to indicate sarcasm. it sincerely explains the similarities between a biological process and a docking simulation, making the label accurate.

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""so much for contradictory thinking,"" ""hold the mythology, please.""
- sentiment indicators: the phrases ""so much for contradictory thinking"" and ""hold the mythology, please"" suggest some frustration or dismissiveness, which can be clues for sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the use of ""so much for contradictory thinking"" and ""hold the mythology, please"" imply that the author is mocking or undermining the idea of logic existing outside the human mind. these phrases are sarcastic in nature as they contrast the idea of logic with mythology, suggesting that logic as an abstract universal concept is as baseless as myth.
- the rest of the text attempts to provide a factual description of what logic is, but the initial sentences set a tone of sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment, indicated by phrases that mock or undermine the concept of logic outside the human mind, aligns with the true intention of being sarcastic about the belief in universal logic.
- the tone of the statement is critical and dismissive, pointing toward a sarcastic interpretation.

given the mocking and dismissive nature of the initial phrases, combined with the critical tone, the final label is **sarcastic**.",1

### Example:
**context:**
the task is to determine whether the given input is sarcastic or not based on a systematic reasoning process.

**example input:**
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

**final conclusion:**
the input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" based on the consistent critical sentiment and lack of sarcastic elements.

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input contains questioning and skeptical language, highlighted by phrases like ""it doesn’t qualify as a source,"" ""most important original proponent,"" and ""expect to be taken seriously?""
- the tone suggests disbelief and a challenge to the logical consistency of another person's argument.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement appears to ridicule the idea that one wouldn't consider the bible as a primary source in a debate about creation.
- there are rhetorical questions and exaggerated disbelief, suggesting that the speaker finds the opposing stance absurd.
- the use of ""expect to be taken seriously?"" hints at mocking the credibility of the other person's argument.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 (skeptical and questioning) aligns with the intention in step 2 (mocking and ridiculing the other person's viewpoint).
- the contrast between the supposed logical expectation (bible as a source) and the criticism of ignoring it suggests a sarcastic undertone.

**final conclusion:**
based on the critical, mocking tone and rhetorical questions, the input exemplifies sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

**reasoning process**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**

- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

**conclusion**:
the surface sentiment ""yes"" is sincere and matches the true intention of the statement. hence, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **keywords**: ""admit"", ""dishonesty"", ""honest"", ""forthcoming""
- **clues**: the phrases ""for all his dishonesty"" and ""he's more honest and forthcoming"" indicate mixed sentiments. the initial part criticizes, while the latter part seemingly praises supersport.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the juxtaposition of ""for all his dishonesty"" with ""he's more honest and forthcoming"" suggests irony; the speaker is using apparent praise to actually criticize both supersport and marc or aa.
- **language style**: the sentence employs irony by contrasting superficial acknowledgment of honesty against a backdrop of overall dishonesty. this is a common feature in sarcastic statements.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- **surface sentiment** indicates mixed feelings with a slight lean towards criticism.
- **true intention** reveals that the speaker is being sarcastic and critical. the apparent praise is undercut by the preceding acknowledgment of dishonesty, which implies that even with dishonesty, supersport is still better than marc or aa.

### conclusion
the surface sentiment of mixed but critical viewpoints, when analyzed against the rhetorical devices and language style indicating irony and sarcasm, leads to the conclusion that the true intention is indeed sarcastic.

        ","### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""more painful,"" ""being burnt,"" ""starving to death,"" ""killing herself,"" ""killing the kid,"" ""don't really care.""
   - sentimental phrases: highly emotional phrases and comparisons with pain, suffering, and death; emotionally charged and provocative language.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the sentence employs hyperbole and provocative comparisons to illustrate extreme scenarios. the mention of highly distressing and extreme situations side by side indicates an intention to provoke strong emotions rather than a straightforward discussion, hinting at a deeper criticism.
   - language style: the language suggests an underlying criticism of how society (or certain groups) views the issue of abortion, using shocking examples to highlight perceived hypocrisy or indifference.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment is one of strong emotional provocation and shock, bringing attention to extreme scenarios.
   - the use of emotional language, hyperbole, and provocative comparisons suggests an intention to criticize rather than to present a factual argument, pointing towards sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the final label is **sarcastic** because the speaker’s strong emotional language, hyperbole, and extreme comparisons imply a critical and sarcastic undertone.",1

### Example:
### context:
you need to establish a reasoning process to determine if a given statement is sarcastic or not.

### example input:
""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

### conclusion:
given the straightforward and factual nature of the statement, combined with the lack of any rhetorical devices or language that would indicate sarcasm, the final label is **not sarcastic**.

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""death penalty,"" ""apeals till your ears bleed.""
- sentiment indicators: the phrase ""apeals till your ears bleed"" is exaggerated and carries a negative connotation, indicating frustration or annoyance.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment has a negative tone, and the exaggerated language hints at sarcasm.
- the true intention shows frustration and criticism towards the inefficiency and lengthiness of the appeals process in death penalty cases.
 
### conclusion:
the use of hyperbole and negative sentiment indicates that the author is implying something critical about the appeals process. this aligns with a sarcastic tone.

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the message overall contains neutral and explanatory language. keywords like ""agnostic,"" ""change,"" and ""evidence"" are used in a factual manner. 
  - the phrase ""sorry if this is just turning into word games"" can indicate a slight apology or acknowledgment of the situation, but it doesn't strongly indicate sarcasm on its own.
  
- **step 2: true intention**
  - the speaker seems to be engaging in a discussion about a topic (agnosticism) and is acknowledging that there may be some semantic or definitional debate involved (""turning into word games"").
  - the intention appears to be genuine, seeking clarification and discourse rather than mocking or exaggerating.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - the surface sentiment is largely neutral and the true intention seems to be a sincere attempt to discuss and resolve a point, with an acknowledgment of potential for misunderstanding. this doesn't align with typical sarcastic cues such as mockery, exaggeration, or incongruence between the literal and intended meaning.

**example input:**
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention without any use of rhetorical devices suggesting sarcasm leads to the conclusion that the text is not sarcastic.

we have a provided example to which we must ascertain and refine the reasoning for why the label ""not sarcastic"" applies.

### example input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.
- terms like ""pre-existing fitness landscape,"" ""converge on similar endpoints,"" and ""many parallels,"" are scientific and factual in nature.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be educational and explanatory.
- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:
given the neutral and informative nature of both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the text, the correct label for the example input is conclusively ""not sarcastic.""

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the sentence ""well, that's generally true of any process that uses energy. some is wasted."" includes a phrase ""well, that's generally true"" which often precedes a sarcastic or resigned acknowledgment. the overall language is descriptive and appears neutral at first glance.
  
- **step 2: true intention**
  - the use of ""well"" to start the sentence, along with the slightly dismissive tone of ""that's generally true,"" can be indicative of sarcasm. the sentence seems to downplay or trivialize the obviousness of the fact stated (""some is wasted""), implying that it is so universally known that it's not worth restating, thereby mocking the simplicity or obviousness of the statement.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - the surface sentiment appears neutral but when closely examined, the true intention reveals a use of slight mockery or resignation, suggesting a hidden meaning contrary to the surface sentiment, which aligns with sarcasm.

### conclusion:
the phrase ""well, that's generally true of any process that uses energy. some is wasted."" is classified as sarcastic due to the dismissive tone and the intent to mock the obviousness of the statement.",1

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.
- terms like ""pre-existing fitness landscape,"" ""converge on similar endpoints,"" and ""many parallels,"" are scientific and factual in nature.

**step 2: true intention**

- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:
given the neutral and informative nature of both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the text, the correct label for the example input is conclusively ""not sarcastic.""

### reasoning:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the text seems to be neutral and factual with phrases such as ""no 'time' existed prior to the 'big bang.'""
- however, the use of quotation marks around words like ""where"", ""sit"", ""always"", ""eternity"", and ""time"" can imply a mocking or questioning tone, suggesting a deeper sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention seems to challenge the conventional understanding of certain concepts in a sarcastic manner.
- by putting words in quotes and using a somewhat dismissive tone, the speaker implies that these concepts are being misused or misunderstood.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears neutral but the quotation marks and skeptical tone suggest sarcasm.
- the true intention is likely to point out the absurdity or inapplicability of these concepts (""where"", ""sit"", ""always"", ""eternity"", ""time"") in the context before the big bang, in a manner that is mocking or ironic.

### conclusion:
considering the surface sentiment and the true intention, the text uses rhetorical devices like quotation marks to convey a mocking or ironic tone, making the label ""sarcastic.""",1

   - keywords: ""basic law 101,"" ""a licensed adult over 25 in the car,"" ""not 18 or 21, but 25,"" ""14 year olds or above.""
   - sentimental phrases: the use of ""basic law 101"" and the emphasis on ""a licensed adult over 25 in the car"" suggests an authoritative tone.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the use of uppercase letters for specific phrases and the tone of ""basic law 101"" indicates a mocking or condescending tone. there's a suggestion that the speaker finds the regulation about the age of the licensed adult driver somewhat ridiculous or overly specific.
   - language style: the language is assertive and seems aimed at pointing out an absurdity or an overemphasis on a rule. the emphasis and diction suggest a critique of the rule by implying that it is excessively detailed or nonsensical.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment seems to be authoritative and instructional, but the exaggerated emphasis on the age ""25"" and use of ""basic law 101"" imply that the speaker is mocking the rule rather than providing genuine instruction.
   - there is a discrepancy between the surface message (which could seem factual and instructional) and the underlying tone (which is critical and mocking).

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""just"", ""it happens.""
- clues: the phrase ""just a newly-evolved structure"" appears to underplay the significance of the event, while ""it happens."" suggests it's a normal occurrence.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of ""just"" minimizes the importance of the newly-evolved structure, which could indicate irony. ""it happens."" further normalizes an event that might otherwise be significant or unusual.
- language style: the dismissive tone is a common indicator of sarcasm, as it may imply the speaker finds the event more remarkable than they are letting on.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is neutral or dismissive.
- the true intention, given the possible underplaying of significance, suggests irony.

**conclusion**:
the surface sentiment's dismissiveness does not align with the likely true intention, which is to ironically downplay something notable. consequently, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment of the text includes a degree of criticism and skepticism.
- phrases like ""you used an oxymoron"" and ""great and evangelist got together about as well as military intelligence"" employ sarcasm.
- these comparisons typically use irony to contrast ideas that are not usually combined sincerely.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention behind the text is to mock or criticize the idea of a ""great evangelist"" by labeling it an oxymoron.
- the comparison to ""military intelligence"" further indicates the use of sarcasm as ""military intelligence"" is commonly used sarcastically to imply that the two terms are contradictory.
- the latter part of the text continues with scrutiny and doubt concerning the individual referred to as the ""preacher.""

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows signs of sarcasm through specific phrases and the contrived contrast between terms.

### Example:
**context:** 

assigning sarcasm labels to text involves analyzing both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the words. 

**example input:**
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

**example label:** not sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention without any use of rhetorical devices suggesting sarcasm leads to the conclusion that the text is not sarcastic.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment includes both neutral and some potentially negative elements.
- keywords/phrases with negative connotations: ""oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?"", ""*cough* religious *cough* fanfare"", ""ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626"".
- the overall tone has hints of frustration and emphasizing a point.

### step 2: true intention
- there is a use of rhetorical devices and sarcasm, particularly in the phrases ""oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?"" and ""*cough* religious *cough* fanfare"". these highlight the speaker’s intention to mock or criticize the counter-argument about religious individuals being more charitable.
- the language style, especially by directly addressing and belittling “grizzly6626,” shows a clear intent of sarcasm.
- the writer aims to counter the argument suggesting only religious individuals help the needy by pointing out prominent atheists' charitable acts, but does so with heavy sarcasm and mockery.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows negative and mocking elements, while the true intention involves criticizing a stance sarcastically.

### conclusion
- based on alignment between the surface sentiment (negative and mocking) and true intention (heavy sarcasm to criticize the opposing viewpoint), the input text is classified as sarcastic.

"believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless",0,"

### Example:
### context:
you need to establish a reasoning process to determine if a given statement is sarcastic or not.

### example input:
""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

### conclusion:
given the straightforward and factual nature of the statement, combined with the lack of any rhetorical devices or language that would indicate sarcasm, the final label is **not sarcastic**.

- keywords/phrases: ""does not equate,"" ""one thing that both,"" ""reaches that,"" ""faith,"" ""observable evidence,"" ""the bottom line is,"" ""believe in god regardless.""
- sentiment indicators: the text appears to be a neutral and reasoned explanation of the relationship between science and religion regarding belief in god. it does not contain obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that commonly indicate sarcasm.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement uses factual and logical reasoning to differentiate between the roles of faith in religion and observable evidence in science. it emphasizes that both domains acknowledge the lack of observable evidence for the existence of god but approach this with different foundations (faith vs. evidence). this presentation style lacks irony, hyperbole, and other rhetorical devices indicative of sarcasm. the tone is informative and seeks to clarify a common misconception.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment of the text aligns with its true intention. both are straightforward and factual, aiming to clarify the relationship between science and religion rather than mocking or contrasting them in a sarcastic manner.
- the tone remains consistent throughout as explanatory and educational, without any hidden or contradictory meanings that would suggest sarcasm.

### conclusion
given the straightforward and factual nature of the statement, combined with the absence of any rhetorical devices or language hinting at sarcasm, the final label is **not sarcastic**.",0

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the statement contains phrases like ""do you mean someone who was wrong?"" and ""i suspect that you can't."" these phrases indicate a challenging and interrogative tone with an element of disbelief or doubt. the overall sentiment appears confrontational and somewhat negative, especially towards the end where doubt is explicitly expressed with ""i suspect that you can't.""

- **step 2: true intention**
  - there is a rhetorical style present, especially with the choice of words like ""i suspect that you can't."" it's a way of indirectly stating that the person being addressed lacks the ability to provide evidence. this implication of inadequacy and the mocking tone suggests sarcasm. the repetition of pointing out the failure to provide an example reinforces the sarcastic undertone.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - the surface sentiment (confrontational and negative) matches the true intention (mocking and doubting the person's capability). the rhetorical questions and skeptical tone are indicative of sarcastic remarks rather than straightforward queries. the contrast lies in the feigned pretense of seeking an example, while actually doubting any such example exists.

based on the analysis, the phrase is classified as sarcastic.",1

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase appears to use a rhetorical device. by juxtaposing ""killing the innocent"" with ""imprisonment of the criminal,"" it tries to highlight an irony or absurdity in what is being discussed.
- the mention ""of course"" implies that the speaker believes the distinction is obvious, likely mocking the initial assertion.

- the true intention appears to be mocking or highlighting an absurdity, indicating a hidden meaning contrary to the surface sentiment.

### conclusion:
- the surface sentiment and true intention do not align straightforwardly and instead suggest the use of irony or sarcasm.

- **sentimental phrases:** the phrases used are mostly factual and describe specific policies and behaviors without emotional exaggeration.
- **emojis:** none present.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the language is predominantly straightforward and factual, describing the rules and policies regarding adoption for gay and single parents. however, the final phrase ""no fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most americans"" contains an element of ironic exaggeration.
- **language style:** the earlier part of the passage is neutral and informative, but the concluding sentence uses a hint of irony and hyperbole to criticize the weight requirement by implying that it unfairly excludes a large number of potential adoptive parents, particularly americans.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment throughout the majority of the text is informative and neutral, without sarcastic undertones. however, the final sentence introduces a noticeable shift toward irony and exaggeration.
- this discrepancy between the neutral informational tone and the ironic, hyperbolic conclusion suggests an underlying sarcastic intention in the final phrase.

**conclusion:**
the text combines neutral, factual information with a sarcastic remark at the end, particularly aimed at the absurdity of the weight requirement for adoptive parents.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""i'd be pleased to show you,"" ""do show us your numbers.""
- sentiment indicators: while parts of the text appear factual, phrases like ""do show us your numbers"" and ""i'd be pleased to show you"" suggest a potentially condescending or mocking tone, indicating possible sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement discusses scientific concepts in a seemingly educational manner, but it can be interpreted as challenging or mocking the reader's understanding or ability to provide evidence (""do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information"").
- the phrase ""i'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population"" sounds patronizing, as if the author doubts the reader's knowledge or capability.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment shows hints of condescension or mockery, especially in the latter part of the text.
- the true intention behind the text appears to be challenging the reader in a mocking manner rather than genuinely educating them, thus indicating sarcasm.

### Example:
**context:**
the task is to determine whether the given input is sarcastic or not based on a systematic reasoning process.

**example input:**
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

**final conclusion:**
the input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" based on the consistent critical sentiment and lack of sarcastic elements.

However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.   Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk.   Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.   This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions.

        ### Instruction:
        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.
        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment appears to be questioning and skeptical.
- sentimental phrases such as ""that may be your contention,"" ""maybe being gay doesn't mean,"" and ""wake up call"" hint at a dismissive and critical tone.
- the language used projects doubt and challenges prior statements, indicating a potentially negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention seems to expose perceived flaws or misconceptions in the argument that being gay is not associated with higher rates of depression and suicide.
- the mention of the apa re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" and prominent gay activists criticizing the gay community suggest that the author is employing a rhetorical device to highlight contradictions or ironies.
- phrases like ""wake up call"" and ""positive critiques"" in this context seem to imply skepticism toward the notion that there are no significant mental health issues within the gay community.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment and true intention both reveal a critical and potentially mocking tone, aimed at undermining the initial arguments by highlighting perceived contradictions.
- the language used, such as in highlighting the apa's actions and activists' critiques, serves to reinforce a sarcastic stance by using specific examples to counter the claims being discussed.

### conclusion:
given the critical and skeptical tone, combined with rhetorical devices that question the sincerity of the initial statements, the correct label for the input text is ""sarcastic.""",1
"Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.",0,"

### Example:
### context:
we have a provided example to which we must ascertain and refine the reasoning for why the label ""not sarcastic"" applies.

### example input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be educational and explanatory.
- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is critical and somewhat contentious.
- terms like ""no action is just about as bad as failed action,"" ""you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash,"" and ""it's your gig, though, so do what you want,"" suggest a critical and somewhat dismissive tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be to criticize the lack of action regarding a significant issue (gay marriage), despite having a majority in congress.
- the statement ""it's your gig, though, so do what you want,"" suggests that the speaker does not genuinely believe in the lack of action and is using sarcasm to underscore their disagreement and disappointment.
- the historical reference to the civil war and abolitionists demanding more than ""token change"" emphasizes the need for more significant action, contrasting it with the inaction that the speaker criticizes.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is critical and dismissive, which aligns with the true intention of criticizing inaction.
- the use of rhetorical devices like sarcasm and historical comparison indicates that the criticism is not straightforward but wrapped in a layer of irony.

### conclusion:
given the critical and dismissive nature of the surface sentiment and the true intention to criticize inaction through irony and historical comparison, the correct label for the example input is ""sarcastic.""",1
"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"".

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

        Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.
        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment analysis
- keywords: ""defensive gun uses,"" ""legal, non-defense related, gun uses,"" ""times they are used legally,"" ""times they are used illegally.""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""c being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year"" might suggest skepticism or a challenge, as the range is notably wide.

### step 2: deduce true intention
- the passage discusses the comparison of legal and illegal gun uses, aiming to downplay the significance of illegal uses by highlighting how often guns are used legally.
- the phrase ""when you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, b becomes pretty insignificant"" appears to downplay the concerns regarding illegal use by emphasizing legal use statistics.
- the use of ""pretty insignificant"" could imply a dismissive attitude towards the concerns over illegal gun use, potentially indicating a sarcastic tone.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- surface sentiment: informative, statistical.
- true intention: it seems to challenge or undermine the concerns about illegal gun use by emphasizing legal uses, possibly implying that such concerns are overstated or not as important. the dismissive tone towards illegal use statistics suggests sarcasm might be present.

### conclusion
based on the analysis, the input contains elements that suggest a dismissive and possibly sarcastic tone aimed at minimizing the concerns over illegal gun use.

### Example:
**context**: assigning a not sarcastic label to an example input.

**example input**: 
""yes. (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)""

**example label**: 
not sarcastic

**reasoning process**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""yes.""
- clues: the phrase ""yes"" indicates a straightforward affirmation. 

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

**conclusion**:
the surface sentiment ""yes"" is sincere and matches the true intention of the statement. hence, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

"The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc",0,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
we have a provided example to which we must ascertain and refine the reasoning for why the label ""not sarcastic"" applies.

### example input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.
- terms like ""pre-existing fitness landscape,"" ""converge on similar endpoints,"" and ""many parallels,"" are scientific and factual in nature.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be educational and explanatory.
- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:
given the neutral and informative nature of both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the text, the correct label for the example input is conclusively ""not sarcastic.""

### breif response:
the example input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" because the text is neutral and informative, with no rhetorical devices or ironic language to indicate sarcasm. it sincerely explains the similarities between a biological process and a docking simulation, making the label accurate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the sentiment on the surface appears to be neutral when referring to the ""7 day creation"" and making a comparison with the big bang.

**step 2: true intention**
- the sentence structure and context suggest a potential underlying irony. the phrase ""not merely the possibility of divine creation through the big bang etc"" contrasts traditional religious belief in a literal 7-day creation with a more scientific explanation, possibly indicating skepticism or irony towards the latter being considered divine.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- while the surface sentiment is somewhat neutral, the true intention behind the sentence appears to be mocking or making an ironic statement about the comparison between the 7-day creation and scientific theories like the big bang. this mismatch between surface sentiment and true intention suggests sarcasm.

### conclusion
given the underlying mockery and irony found after a thoughtful analysis, the text is labeled ""sarcastic.""",1

example label: not sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""
   - there are no sarcastic indicators such as exaggeration for humor, irony in tone, or contrasting sentiments.
   
2. true intention:

   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

reasoning process:

1. surface sentiment:
   - the text contains a mixture of seemingly informational and argumentative language, but with a sarcastic undertone. phrases like ""you're looking at evolution in way too much of a magical and mystical way"" and ""i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you"" suggest sarcasm.
   - words and phrases like ""magical and mystical,"" ""easy debate victory,"" and ""i lack the eloquence"" are indicative of an ironic tone.

2. true intention:
   - the true intention behind the text is to criticize and mock the other person's understanding of evolution and their arguments against it.
   - by using a dismissive and condescending tone, the writer implies that their opponent's views are simplistic and not well thought out, thus employing sarcasm to make their point.

3. comparison and analysis:
   - the surface sentiment shows a dismissive tone with elements of mockery, which indicates sarcasm.
   - the true intention confirms the use of sarcasm to belittle the argument and the person making it.
   - given the consistent use of an ironic and condescending tone, the text aligns with being sarcastic.

assigning sarcasm labels to text involves analyzing both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the words. 

**example input:**
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

**example label:** not sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention without any use of rhetorical devices suggesting sarcasm leads to the conclusion that the text is not sarcastic.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:**
the surface sentiment appears to be serious and argumentative. the speaker is presenting an extensive argument regarding their perspective on morality. keywords and phrases such as ""rational basis,"" ""moral discussions,"" ""based on reason,"" and the reference to kant's philosophy suggest a thoughtful and earnest tone.

**step 2 - true intention:**
the true intention is to offer a structured rationale for the speaker's moral code, contrasting it with what they perceive as an arbitrary, religion-based moral system. the speaker is emphasizing their preference for a rational, secular approach to morality, and inviting a discussion on the matter.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of seriousness and the true intention of arguing and explaining a moral standpoint align appropriately. there are no indications of irony, exaggeration, or mockery throughout the text that would suggest sarcasm.

since my confidence in my judgment is less than 90%, i will think step by step:

**step 1: what is the surface sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?**

the phrase ""well, that just struck a chord with me."" seems to indicate a surface sentiment of resonance or agreement, suggesting that something has made an impact on the speaker. the rest of the text discusses the idea of people from both sides claiming to have factual support for their positions and emphasizes that reactions to the facts matter more than the facts themselves. the overall tone appears to be reflective rather than confrontational.

**step 2: deduce what the sentence really means, namely the true intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.**

upon examining the true intention, it seems the speaker is commenting on the nature of discourse and debate, pointing out that people often claim to have facts on their side but that the real issue lies in how people react to these facts. the phrase ""people of both sides say, 'we got the facts! the facts support our side!'"" could potentially be read as sarcastic, as it mimics a common argument in a somewhat mocking fashion. however, the clarification that follows (""but it isn't about the facts but how we react to them"") gives a more thoughtful reflection, reducing the possibility of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analyze step 1 and step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.**

there is a slight hint of potential sarcasm when mimicking the argument of having facts, but the broader context of the statement is reflective and genuine about the nature of reactions to information. there is no strong use of irony or exaggeration to suggest a sarcastic tone.

example label: not sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses negative and serious language like ""held captive,"" ""hostile natives,"" ""barricades,"" ""checkpoints,"" ""abandon,"" ""illegal.""

2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be a genuine expression of frustration or disbelief at the described situation, emphasizing the severity and hardship.
   - the detailed descriptions point towards realistic grievances rather than mockery or satire.
   
3. comparison and analysis:
   - both the surface sentiment and the true intention align on conveying a sincere complaint and distress about the depicted circumstances.
   - there is no evidence of sarcasm; rather, the text communicates actual concern or anger about the situation.

conclusion: based on the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention, the text should be labeled as ""not sarcastic.""

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

step 1: surface sentiment
- the text ""a taste of what could be our future if the left has its way"" appears to initially suggest a sample of potential outcomes. however, it lacks specific keywords that show direct negative sentiment, instead positing a hypothetical scenario.

step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""if the left has its way"" is likely critical of political views on the left. the use of ""a taste of what could be our future"" indicates a mild suggestion of a negative scenario, which may be implausible or exaggerated for effect. the phrasing hints at a mocking tone towards the left, implying that their way would lead to a future that the speaker considers undesirable.

step 3: compare and analysis
- comparing the surface sentiment to the true intention, the surface words seem neutral but implicitly convey critique and scepticism. the phrasing suggests that the speaker does not actually believe in a favorable outcome if the left's views were adopted, but is using this structure to mock or criticize those views.

conclusion: the implicit criticism and exaggerated hypothetical scenario strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the text should be labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the initial sentiment seems critical and dismissive, especially in phrases like ""creationism is nothing but lie's"" and ""the skeptic making disparaging remarks.""

- **step 2: true intention**
  - the statement uses phrases that suggest a negative evaluation of the other person's argument. the exaggerated and dismissive tone indicates a use of sarcasm, especially with mocking phrases like ""it seems he attacks you more.""

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - the surface sentiment of critical tone matches with the underlying mocking intention. the structure and phrasing strongly suggest sarcasm as they aim to undermine the other person's points indirectly.

### label:

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the phrase includes strong opinions and critical language, particularly ""the 9th circuit in sodom"" and ""making law instead of interpreting it."" this indicates frustration or disapproval, with potentially negative sentiment. the use of ""sodom"" implies mockery and derision.
  
- **step 2: true intention**
  - the author is likely criticizing the judicial actions of the 9th circuit court, suggesting they overreach their authority. the phrase ""that is why they are over ruled so often......."" is meant to mock the court's decisions, indicating exasperation and irony.
  
- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - the negative sentiment (mockery, disapproval) in the surface aligns with a deeper ironic or sarcastic intention, as the author is not merely reporting a fact but expressing disdain with a sarcastic tone.
  
### conclusion:
the phrase employs mockery and derision to criticize, constituting a classic example of sarcasm. hence, it is classified as sarcastic.",1
Certainly it does.,0,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**
the task is to determine whether the given input is sarcastic or not based on a systematic reasoning process.

**example input:**
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

**final conclusion:**
the input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" based on the consistent critical sentiment and lack of sarcastic elements.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let's analyze the input systematically.

### input:
certainly it does.

### step 1: analyze the surface sentiment
- the surface sentiment appears to be positive.
- the phrase ""certainly it does"" seems to affirm something with certainty.

### step 2: deduce the true intention
- to determine if the statement is sarcastic, we need to assess if the true intention matches the surface sentiment or if there’s an underlying contrast.
- without additional context, it's challenging to definitively ascertain the true intention. however, ""certainly it does"" can be sarcastic if it is responding to a statement or question with an inferred absurdity or extreme improbability.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment expresses certainty and positivity.
- the true intention might be to mock or highlight the improbability of the preceding statement or question, thus suggesting sarcasm.
- given the lack of explicit contrasting clues, yet recognizing the phrase’s potential to be sarcastic depending on prior context, we'll carefully assess the likelihood of sarcasm.

### final conclusion:
given the potential for sarcasm, especially considering the phrase's typical usage, and the absence of additional context to strongly affirm sincerity, it is more prudent to label it as:

### reasoning process:

- **step 1: surface sentiment**
  - the text includes phrases such as ""massive nation wide government conspiracy"" and ""utter bs,"" which carry a negative and dismissive tone. words like ""please post it"" and ""retract your bs statement"" hint at confrontation. additionally, the repetitive use of sarcastic rhetorical questions (e.g., ""where do you get this stuff?"") indicates incredulity and mocking.

- **step 2: true intention**
  - the repetitive rhetorical questions and strong language suggest the writer is highly skeptical and dismissive of the opposing viewpoint. the exaggeration in phrases like ""massive nation wide government conspiracy"" and ""utter bs"" is commonly used in sarcasm to highlight perceived absurdity in the opposing argument. these elements imply the author's intention is not merely to debate but to mock or belittle the opposing viewpoint.

- **step 3: comparison and analysis**
  - the negative and dismissive surface sentiment aligns with an intention to mock or criticize, rather than to genuinely inform or question. the use of rhetorical devices, exaggerated language, and confrontational tone all point to a sarcastic stance. 

based on the surface sentiment (negative, dismissive) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical), the text is classified as sarcastic.",1

### Example:
**context**: assigning a not sarcastic label to an example input.

**example input**: 
""yes. (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)""

**example label**: 
not sarcastic

**reasoning process**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""yes.""
- clues: the phrase ""yes"" indicates a straightforward affirmation. 

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the parenthetical note ""(and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)"" seems to indicate a technical or procedural reason for adding more text. 
- language style: the style is casual and explanatory, not inherently sarcastic.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the straightforward affirmation ""yes"" aligns with an affirmative response.
- the explanatory parenthesis simply clarifies the purpose of additional text without any detectable irony or mockery.

**conclusion**:
the surface sentiment ""yes"" is sincere and matches the true intention of the statement. hence, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.

**reasoning process**:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""i hope"", ""change your mind""
- clues: the phrases indicate a wish or a desire for a change in opinion, which seems positive and sincere.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the statement ""i hope i have already begun to change your mind"" can be read with an underlying tone of impatience or frustration, especially if used in a context where someone is being resistant to change. 
- language style: the phrasing can be interpreted as sarcastic if the speaker has tried several times without success and is now making a pointed remark about the difficulty of convincing the listener.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment indicates a positive desire for change.
- the true intention, when considered in a potentially frustrated or exasperated context, suggests a sarcastic undertone.

### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""right."" at the beginning and the context suggests a level of disbelief or mockery. the critical tone, particularly in ""dress creationism up"" and ""call it 'creation science,'"" suggests that the speaker is ridiculing the attempts to legitimize creationism as science. there's a clear usage of rhetorical devices indicating sarcasm.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text uses phrases like ""actually,"" ""proven you and cash to be utterly wrong,"" and ""the fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant.""
   - there is an element of direct confrontation and dismissal which hints at a critical and possibly mocking tone.
   
2. true intention:
   - the intention seems to be to belittle or mock the other party for their lack of recognition of being 'wrong.'
   - the phrase ""utterly wrong"" combined with ""the fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant"" indicates a dismissive and sarcastic tone, suggesting the speaker is not genuinely trying to inform but rather to deride.

3. comparison and analysis:
   - the surface sentiment appears critical and dismissive.
   - the true intention aligns with the sarcastic dismissal of the other party's understanding or recognition.
   - the tone and phrasing imply a layer of mockery and sarcasm, as the speaker's true intention is to belittle rather than simply inform.

conclusion: based on the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention, the text should be labeled as ""sarcastic.""

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
the example input involves a discussion about sex, contraception, and abortion legislation. it debates the impact of criminalizing abortion on women's well-being and questions the viewpoint of those who wish to legislate against it.

### example input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""government,"" ""rights and responsibilities.""
   - sentimental phrases: the statement mentions the government and its slogan, which may seem positive on the surface.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**

### Example:
**context:** 

assigning sarcasm labels to text involves analyzing both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the words. 

**example input:**
i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.

**example label:** not sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention without any use of rhetorical devices suggesting sarcasm leads to the conclusion that the text is not sarcastic.

### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:**
the surface sentiment here appears to be religious and somewhat instructive, as the text consists of a passage from the bible. however, the concluding question ""are they mistakenly reading this?"" signals a potential doubt or skepticism.

**step 2 - true intention:**
the true intention behind the text seems to be to question the literal interpretation of the biblical passage. by juxtaposing a direct scripture with a questioning tone, it likely implies that the reader should reconsider taking the scripture at face value, especially concerning miracles and supernatural events.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment presents religious instructions, but the true intention reveals a skeptical or mocking interpretation of those instructions. the contrast between the solemn biblical passage and the sarcastic question at the end (""are they mistakenly reading this?"") indicates an ironic tone, suggesting that the author does not believe in the literal interpretation of the passage.

**conclusion:**
the surface religious sentiment and the true intention of skepticism and irony do not align, indicating sarcasm.",1

reasoning process:
1. surface sentiment:
   - the text includes a mix of serious discussion and a slightly dismissive tone, particularly towards the end with phrases like ""let's-all-just-get-along"" and ""a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism.""
   - there are elements of doubt regarding the seriousness of the gaia theory with phrases like ""sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory.""

2. true intention:
   - the intention appears to mock the gaia theory by contrasting it with creationism and implying that it is not serious science (""feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory"").
   - the comparison to creationism, known mostly for its controversial stance in the scientific community, serves to undermine the credibility of gaia theory, implying that it is marginally more acceptable only because creationism is seen as less scientifically valid.

3. comparison and analysis:
   - the surface sentiment carries a subtle tone of mockery and dismissiveness.
   - the true intention is to critique and convey disbelief in the gaia theory's validity in a roundabout way—which is a hallmark of sarcasm.
   
conclusion: based on the alignment between the surface sentiment and true intention, the text exhibits sarcasm in its subtle dismissal of the gaia theory.

the example input involves a discussion about sex, contraception, and abortion legislation. it debates the impact of criminalizing abortion on women's well-being and questions the viewpoint of those who wish to legislate against it.

### example input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

        ### Input:
        Well, Google is your friend here - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.   It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as ""one big preservation event"" and lots of ""little preservations"". If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation.   I've been a bit vague here as it is a) such a broad subject to describe succinctly b) I'm tired and c) I'm full of cold   No doubt someone who isn't under the influence of b) and/or c) will chime in as well with more details while I pull round.   Now, where was my hankerchief......

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: not sarcastic

**reasoning:**

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""google is your friend,"" ""fossilisation,"" ""broad subject,"" ""succinctly,"" ""tired,"" ""full of cold,"" ""hankerchief.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems informative and slightly casual, given the use of phrases like ""google is your friend,"" ""tired,"" and ""full of cold."" the mention of ""hankerchief"" adds a personal, somewhat light-hearted touch.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage's intention appears to be to guide someone on how to find information about fossilization.
- the author acknowledges their current state (tired and full of cold) but still aims to provide useful advice and admits the complexity of the topic.
- there's no exaggerated praise, criticism, or irony that would typically indicate sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative, slightly casual.
- true intention: providing guidance and admitting personal limitations due to being tired and sick.
- surface and true intention align, with no elements that suggest sarcasm. the informal tone and small jokes (like the hankerchief) show a casual, helpful attitude rather than sarcasm.

therefore, the passage should be labeled as **not sarcastic**.",0

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""why would they be useless,"" ""they aren't useless on birds?,"" ""how is this question different,"" ""it seems that soaring or gliding or even faster running would be extremely useful.""
   - sentimental phrases: phrases like ""why would they be useless"" and ""they aren't useless on birds"" suggest a tone of disbelief or questioning the usefulness of something, potentially implying the opposite.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the question ""why would they be useless?"" and the comparisons made by the speaker are rhetorical, often a hint at sarcasm. predominantly, questions like these are sarcastic to mock the idea that something is useless by presenting clear counterexamples.
   - language style: the language used is confrontational and questioning, which often indicates a sarcastic undertone meant to imply the opposite of what is being stated directly.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment shows disbelief and questioning, which in itself hints at sarcasm.
   - the true intention through rhetorical questions and the way the examples are presented indicates the speaker does not genuinely believe the subject in question is useless; rather, they think it’s quite the opposite.

**conclusion:**
the final label is **sarcastic** because the speaker's use of rhetorical questions and examples clearly implies a mocking tone meant to suggest the opposite of the literal meaning.",1

the phrase ""excellent point doc"" likely employs a sarcastic tone. 

### reasoning process and conclusion

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords: ""excellent point doc""
- sentimental tone: appears to be praising or acknowledging a good point
- indicative at phrase level: the brevity and context suggest potential sarcasm, particularly ""excellent point"" often follows a preceding weak or flawed argument.

**step 2: true intention**
- the intention might not genuinely be to praise the point.
- it is implying that the point was obvious or weak, which indicates the use of irony.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the surface sentiment of praise contrasts with the actual intention to mock or highlight the obviousness/weakness of the point made, typical of sarcasm.

**conclusion**: 
- the use of an exaggerated compliment ""excellent point"" in a likely dismissive tone suggests sarcasm.

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment can be perceived as somewhat callous and dismissive.
- phrases like ""we need young to survive"" and ""it's the old that are expendable"" suggest a lack of empathy.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention seems to be highlighting the absurdity or inhumanity of prioritizing the young over the elderly in such a stark manner.
- the statement employs exaggeration (hyperbole) and a shocking comparison, often used as rhetorical devices to highlight an issue through irony.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment and true intention do not align in a straightforward manner.
- there is a clear indication of irony, which is a common marker of sarcasm.
- the use of stark and extreme language indicates that the statement is likely meant to provoke thought rather than being a literal opinion.

given these points, the text uses rhetorical devices to imply sarcasm and highlight the underlying absurdity of the sentiment expressed. therefore, the correct label for the input is ""sarcastic.""",1

### Example:
### context:
you need to establish a reasoning process to determine if a given statement is sarcastic or not.

### example input:
""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

### conclusion:
given the straightforward and factual nature of the statement, combined with the lack of any rhetorical devices or language that would indicate sarcasm, the final label is **not sarcastic**.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""skeptic,"" ""no judges,"" ""this suits me,"" ""too many,"" ""avoid slighting""
- sentiment indicators: the phrases used (especially ""this suits me"" and ""avoid slighting anyone"") suggest a hidden, possibly negative sentiment underneath a seemingly neutral or positive surface.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement employs irony. the author mentions that the skeptic has requested no judges and then sarcastically add that it suits them because there are too many to pick from. this suggests the author is not genuinely pleased with the situation but instead pointing out the absurdity or inconvenience of it.
- the use of ""too many of you"" and ""avoid slighting anyone"" implies a sense of frustration or sarcasm rather than a genuine preference.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment (seemingly accommodating) does not align with the true intention (irony and frustration).
- the tone has an underlying mockery, suggesting the author does not genuinely find the situation suitable or beneficial.

**context:**
the task is to determine whether the given input is sarcastic or not based on a systematic reasoning process.

**example input:**
""and religion is what caused the crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called 'in the name of atheism'.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

**step 1: analyze the surface sentiment**
- the input expresses a negative sentiment towards religion, emphasizing its association with wars and bloody disputes.
- keywords like ""wars,"" ""bloody disputes,"" ""died,"" and the repeated use of ""many"" convey a serious and critical tone.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement uses strong language to argue that religion has been the cause of many deaths and conflicts throughout history.
- there are no evident rhetorical devices or exaggerated praise that suggest sarcasm; the repetition of ""many"" is used to stress the gravity of the point rather than to mock.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

**final conclusion:**
the input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" based on the consistent critical sentiment and lack of sarcastic elements.

- keywords like ""lack of knowledge,"" ""ignorant,"" ""mocking,"" ""ffs,"" and ""do try to use a source"" convey frustration and contempt.

**step 2: deduce the true intention**
- the statement employs rhetorical devices and sarcastic tones, especially in phrases like ""your links sure show a lack of knowledge"" and ""do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.""
- the intention is to mock the validity and relevance of the sources rather than providing constructive criticism or debate.

**step 3: compare and analysis**

"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see.

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment appears to be thoughtful and analytical as it discusses potential legal implications and the equal protection clause.
- the text uses phrases like ""this could be interesting,"" ""we'll have to wait and see,"" which can be interpreted as earnest consideration.

**step 2: true intention**
- however, throughout the text, there is an underlying tone of skepticism and irony, particularly in statements like ""yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense"" and ""i don't know....it could be interesting.""
- the use of ""yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense"" at the beginning comes off as sarcastic because it is often used to preface a point that actually shows contradiction or problems rather than agreement.
- the author appears to doubt the rationality of the situation despite its apparent logic, indicating sarcasm.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- although the surface sentiment is analytical, the true intention reveals skepticism and doubt towards the situation described.
- the sarcastic tone is conveyed through specific phrases and the way the argument is framed, leading to a discrepancy between surface sentiment and true intention.

### conclusion:
the underlying sarcasm is detected upon closer analysis, making the correct label for the input text ""sarcastic.""",1

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
we have a provided example to which we must ascertain and refine the reasoning for why the label ""not sarcastic"" applies.

### example input:
""like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete. http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857 figure 1: similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm. there are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment in the excerpt is neutral and informative.
- the text focuses on comparing biological development to a docking simulation.
- terms like ""pre-existing fitness landscape,"" ""converge on similar endpoints,"" and ""many parallels,"" are scientific and factual in nature.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention of the text appears to be educational and explanatory.
- there is no indication of a rhetorical device aimed at mocking or conveying irony.
- the objective seems to convey a comparison and similarities between two processes sincerely.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- both the surface sentiment and true intention align in being neutral, factual, and non-ironical.
- there is no apparent discrepancy or hidden sarcasm in the language or style used.

### conclusion:
given the neutral and informative nature of both the surface sentiment and the true intention behind the text, the correct label for the example input is conclusively ""not sarcastic.""

### breif response:
the example input is labeled ""not sarcastic"" because the text is neutral and informative, with no rhetorical devices or ironic language to indicate sarcasm. it sincerely explains the similarities between a biological process and a docking simulation, making the label accurate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

**step-by-step reasoning:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- the surface sentiment is mixed. it appears to be both praising and critical.
- keywords and phrases like ""i'm impressed!"" and ""very precise description"" initially seem positive.
- however, as the text progresses, phrases like ""it sounds like the whole 'proof' is pointless"" reveal a critical and possibly mocking tone.
- the final phrase ""hmmm...."" adds an element of doubt or skepticism.

**step 2: true intention**
- the true intention seems to undermine the argument or ""proof"" being discussed.
- the initial praise is likely sarcastic, as indicated by the shift to critique and doubt as the text unfolds.
- the phrase ""just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, god is defined as 'the greatest being possible'"" suggests an underlying mocking tone, doubting the validity or meaningfulness of the proof.
- overall, the text tries to expose the circular nature of the proof being described.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears mixed, but a more in-depth analysis shows a sarcastic tone.
- the true intention is to criticize or mock the argument, revealing a discrepancy between the initial positive tone and the critical content that follows.
- given this analysis, the elements of sarcasm are apparent through the rhetorical devices and language style used.

### conclusion:
the text shows clear signs of sarcasm, using initial praise to later undermine and criticize the argument, making ""sarcastic"" the correct label.",1

### Example:
### context:
you need to establish a reasoning process to determine if a given statement is sarcastic or not.

### example input:
""well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. and the source is from the recently published book evaluating gun policy which you can read and review. the source is listed at the bottom.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""makes sense,"" ""recently published book,"" ""you can read and review.""
- sentiment indicators: the text is straightforward with no obvious negative sentiment or exaggerated claims that might suggest sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement is factual and offers a logical explanation about why burglars might target gun owners. it also cites a credible source (a book) for further reading, adding to its credibility.
- there is no use of irony, hyperbole, or other rhetorical devices that would suggest the author is implying the opposite of what they are saying.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention. both are factual and straightforward, without any hidden or contradictory meanings.
- the tone of the statement is informative and educational, rather than sarcastic or mocking.

### conclusion:
given the straightforward and factual nature of the statement, combined with the lack of any rhetorical devices or language that would indicate sarcasm, the final label is **not sarcastic**.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""notice the double-standard here?"", ""homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment,"" ""they are willing to provide names and addresses,"" ""i can't wait to see the backlash""
- sentiment indicators: the use of “double-standard” and the phrase ""i can't wait to see the backlash"" suggests dissatisfaction and a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices / language style: the statement includes rhetorical questioning (""notice the double-standard here?"") and uses emotionally charged language (""homosexual lobby,"" ""accuses us of harassment,"" ""provide names and addresses""). the phrase ""i can't wait to see the backlash"" is likely intended ironically, implying that the speaker is not genuinely looking forward to it but rather expects negative outcomes.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is negative and aggrieved, and the true intention is similarly critical and disdainful. both the surface sentiment and the true intention exhibit clear signs of sarcasm through rhetorical questions and ironic remarks.
- the tone of the statement, overall, is sarcastic, as the speaker does not genuinely appreciate or look forward to the events described but instead criticizes the perceived actions of the ""homosexual lobby.""

        ","### label: sarcastic

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the text contains negative and derogatory language like ""you murder the english language everytime you post,"" indicating a critical tone.
   - the use of phrases like ""everytime you post,"" ""the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby,"" and ""someone who may or may not exist"" also suggest a mocking or dismissive attitude.

2. **true intention:**
   - the intention seems to be to mock or belittle the person being addressed. for instance, ""you murder the english language"" is a hyperbolic statement meant to criticize harshly.
   - the statement ""i'm not going to incubate something in my body because of you think it's wrong"" uses a sarcastic dismissal of someone's moral stance by questioning its validity.
   - the overall structure and phrasing indicate irony and mockery rather than a straightforward critique.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment and true intention both align with a sarcastic tone, as the speaker uses exaggerated criticism and ironic statements to mock and belittle the recipient.
   - given the mocking tone and hyperbolic phrasing, the text fits well into the category of sarcasm. 

therefore, based on the analysis of both the surface sentiment and true intention, the text is labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1

**example label:** not sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1 - surface sentiment:** 
surface sentiment appears to be skeptical and somewhat challenging. keywords such as ""skeptical"" clearly indicate doubt or disbelief. 

**step 2 - true intention:** 
upon analyzing the true intention, the speaker seems to be genuinely questioning the validity of some claims about gun ownership statistics, strongly implying that removing groups such as democrats and liberals from the statistics skews the meaningful representation. there are no exaggerated or ironic statements suggesting the opposite of the literal meaning.

**step 3 - comparison and analysis:**
the surface sentiment of skepticism matches the true intention of questioning the claims’ validity. there’s no obvious attempt to use irony, exaggeration, or mockery, hallmarks of sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the alignment between the surface sentiment and the true intention without any use of rhetorical devices suggesting sarcasm leads to the conclusion that the text is not sarcastic.

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""respect,"" ""don't have any respect,"" ""great respect,"" ""earned that respect.""
   - sentimental phrases: the phrases used are direct and convey respect and lack of respect with clarity, without emotional exaggeration or negativity.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the sentence utilizes contrast but does not employ hyperbole, irony, or other rhetorical figures commonly associated with sarcasm.
   - language style: the language is straightforward and factual, pointing out a distinction between creationist beliefs and individual creationists based on personal experiences.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment is one of clear distinction and conditional respect, which correlates directly with the true intention of the speaker.
   - there is no discrepancy or contrasting meaning that would indicate sarcasm; the message is honest and direct.

**conclusion:**
the final label is **not sarcastic** because the speaker's sentiment is genuine and there is no irony or implied meaning different from the surface message.

- the sentiment in step 1 aligns with the intention deduced in step 2; both indicate a critical stance without veering into sarcastic or ironic tones.
- the earnest and serious critique of religion and its impact on history does not exhibit the characteristics of sarcasm, such as contrast between literal and intended meanings, mock praise, or exaggeration for comedic effect.

- both steps indicate a disdainful and sarcastic critique rather than a straightforward, sincere critique.
- the mock praise and irony establish a clear contrast between the literal phrasing and the intended negative connotation.

### final conclusion
the input text exhibits several characteristics of sarcasm, such as irony, exaggerated criticism, and mock praise.

### label: sarcastic",1
"But we certainly have the right to evict such persons.   But then, regardless, the embryo is not a person.",0,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
the example input involves a discussion about sex, contraception, and abortion legislation. it debates the impact of criminalizing abortion on women's well-being and questions the viewpoint of those who wish to legislate against it.

### example input:
""so, you would vote to legislate against it? ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. then, if everything fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. i doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. it will only cause suffering and fear for women. i thought we were out of the dark ages already.""

### example label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment analysis**
- keywords: ""legislate against it,"" ""sex is a healthy part,"" ""condom,"" ""contraceptive,"" ""abortion,"" ""suffering and fear for women,"" ""out of the dark ages.""
- sentimental phrases: the overall sentiment seems serious and informative. the use of the phrase ""out of the dark ages"" could imply frustration or a strong opinion.

**step 2: deduce true intention**
- the passage is structured as a direct argument against criminalizing abortion.
- it includes logical statements about the risks and choices around sex and contraception.
- the final sentence ""i thought we were out of the dark ages already"" could be interpreted as a strong stance rather than sarcasm, emphasizing the backwardness of opposing views.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment: informative and assertive.
- true intention: a clear argument presenting factual data and logical reasoning against criminalizing abortion.
- the surface and true intention align, showing no contradictory, exaggerated, or ironic elements typical of sarcasm.

### conclusion: 
based on the detailed reasoning steps, the example input is logical and serious, indicating it is **not sarcastic**.

   - the text includes phrases like ""you should have said that"" and ""i might have agreed with you,"" which on the surface appear to be cooperative or agreeable.
   
2. true intention:
   - the context of the statement suggests that the speaker is being ironic. the use of ""should have said"" implies that the actual situation is different from what is being stated. the conditional ""might have agreed with you"" indicates a reality where the speaker does not agree.
   - there is a contrast between the surface sentiment (agreeable language) and the true intention (disagreement and possibly criticism), which is a common marker of sarcasm.

3. comparison and analysis:
   - the surface sentiment of agreement does not align with the true intention of disagreement.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**
refining the reasoning process for assigning a not sarcastic label to a sentence.

**example input:**
""actually, i don't have any respect for creationism in most of its varied forms. i have had great respect for several individual creationists that i have met. but they earned that respect.""

**example label:**
not sarcastic

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""respect,"" ""don't have any respect,"" ""great respect,"" ""earned that respect.""
   - sentimental phrases: the phrases used are direct and convey respect and lack of respect with clarity, without emotional exaggeration or negativity.
   - emojis: none present.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the sentence utilizes contrast but does not employ hyperbole, irony, or other rhetorical figures commonly associated with sarcasm.
   - language style: the language is straightforward and factual, pointing out a distinction between creationist beliefs and individual creationists based on personal experiences.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment is one of clear distinction and conditional respect, which correlates directly with the true intention of the speaker.
   - there is no discrepancy or contrasting meaning that would indicate sarcasm; the message is honest and direct.

**conclusion:**
the final label is **not sarcastic** because the speaker's sentiment is genuine and there is no irony or implied meaning different from the surface message.

**reasoning process and conclusion:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - keywords: ""your saying,"" ""mean nothing,"" ""yeah right.""
   - sentimental phrases: ""yeah right"" conveys a dismissive or disbelieving tone.
   - emojis: none present, but the phrase ""yeah right"" often functions similarly to an eye-roll emoji in context.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - rhetorical devices: the phrase ""yeah right"" is typically used sarcastically to indicate disbelief or contradiction of the preceding statement.
   - language style: the language uses colloquialism and informal speech, with ""yeah right"" indicating that the speaker doesn't genuinely agree with or believe the statement about eyewitnesses meaning nothing.

3. **step 3: compare and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment suggests disbelief, and the true intention, as revealed by the rhetorical ""yeah right,"" strongly indicates sarcasm.
   - the sentence is stating one thing (that an eyewitness would mean nothing) only to contradict it immediately, which is a typical sarcasm marker.

**conclusion:**
the final label is **sarcastic** because the dual meaning conveyed by the language, especially the phrase ""yeah right,"" indicates that the speaker is sarcastically dismissing the notion that an eyewitness account would mean nothing.",1
"Do you have a fire extinguisher in your house? I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there.

### Example:
### context:
you have provided an example input and asked for a refined reasoning process to determine if the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

- the language used does not contain rhetorical questions, mocking tones, or exaggerated statements typical of sarcasm.
- the intention appears to advocate for preparedness and safety in a sincere manner.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment, indicating practicality and preparedness, aligns with the true intention of advocating for safety measures.
- there is no significant contrast between the purported message and the underlying meaning that would suggest sarcasm.

Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""oh what a shame!"", ""especially if it's true!"", ""where did you get the idea that id theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrases express a mock concern and disbelief which are indicative of sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the exclamation ""oh what a shame!"" and ""especially if it's true!"" are exaggerated and imply disbelief rather than genuine concern. the question ""where did you get the idea that id theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?"" implies that the speaker believes it is commonly known or obvious that id theory lacks scientific evidence, thus using rhetorical questioning to mock the idea.
- **language style:** the use of exaggerated concern and rhetorical questioning are typical of sarcastic remarks.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment seems to express concern and surprise, the true meaning, revealed through exaggeration and rhetorical questioning, suggests the speaker is actually mocking the idea that id theory is based on evidence.

**conclusion:**
- the surface sentiment's exaggerated concern and the rhetorical questions indicate a mocking tone. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords: ""nonsensical,"" ""mere presence of a weapon,"" ""more likely that there is going to be a problem"" 
- sentimental phrases: the term ""nonsensical"" and the sarcastic tone of not understanding why weapons increase problems suggest a negative sentiment towards those who believe more guns lead to more problems.
- the surface sentiment seems to dismiss or ridicule the notion that the presence of weapons increases the likelihood of problems.

**step 2: true intention:**
- rhetorical devices: the use of hyperbole in ""lots and lots of guns"" and ""murder rate at my house was 0"" indicates exaggeration intended to mock the other viewpoint.
- language style: phrases like ""i will never understand why"" and ""most likely maintain the same this year"" imply an obviously sarcastic tone.
- the statement seems to sarcastically dismiss arguments for the control of weapons, suggesting that the presence of weapons at homes or places like universities does not contribute to violence.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (mocking the perceived danger of weapons) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (suggesting weapons do not increase problems).
- this contrast between the dismissal of concerns about weapon presence and the appearance of a logical argument indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the concerns related to the presence of weapons. the mocking nature and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to genuinely argue the safety of having weapons but to sarcastically undermine the concerns related to it.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:** identifying sarcasm in statements.

**example input:** gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the statement's true intention is to mock the character’s ineffectiveness, despite the surface-level excitement. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### Example:
**context:**
refining reasoning for determining the sarcasm in the provided example input.

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and dismissive tone.
- **keywords**: ""superstitious nonsense,"" ""mythological,"" ""incorrect reference.""
- **sentimental phrases**: phrases like ""superstitious nonsense"" and ""mythological"" convey a clearly negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the sentence employs rhetorical dismissal and correction, indicating that the speaker is not genuinely addressing a neutral audience but instead criticizing the person they are speaking to.
- **language style**: the language style is mocking and dismissive, especially in its authoritative correction (""even from the bronze age, let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age"").
- **intended meaning**: the speaker is critiquing the other person's understanding and spreading of what they consider baseless or incorrect ideas. the use of specific historical corrections serves to further this critique by pointing out supposed ignorance or error.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment of mockery and dismissal corresponds with the true intention of criticism.
- **inference**: the critical, mocking tone and the corrective nature of the statements suggest that the speaker is using sarcasm to diminish the credibility of the person they are addressing.

### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **sentimental phrases:** there are no sentimental phrases, hyperboles, or exaggerations that typically indicate sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the language is factual and educational, intended to clarify misconceptions about the human eye's ability to perceive color.
- **language style:** the author provides a logical and detailed explanation on the topic of color perception without employing irony or exaggeration. the tone is explanatory rather than dismissive or mocking.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment aligns with the true intention, which is to inform and clarify rather than to mock or convey a hidden meaning.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic, given the rhetorical device used and the mismatch between surface and true sentiment.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

        ","### response:

### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""60% accepting roe v wade is a high figure don't you think?"" could be interpreted with a tone of disbelief or questioning.
- ""more people support abortion then the president"" implies a comparison that might be critical of either the president's popularity or the nature of public opinion on abortion.

### step 2: true intention

- the comparison to the president’s support could serve as a subtle critique of the president's popularity or the contentious nature of the abortion debate, suggesting an element of irony or criticism.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains elements of questioning and potential disbelief, which can often accompany sarcasm.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        How about a sin tax of $100 dollars each time you log on and $10 dollars a word for each time you speak one?   It's fair because it would help pay for all the lying propaganda damage you do to society. Rights come with responsibilities.   On guns, no can do. SCOTUS has ruled many times that a right freely stated in the Constitution cannot be compelled to purchase a license nor a fee to exercise.   NEXT!
        You can choose to output the result directly if you believe your judgment is reliable,
        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the initial suggestion ""how about a sin tax"" is immediately unrealistic and extreme.
- phrases like ""$100 dollars each time you log on and $10 dollars a word for each time you speak one?"" exaggerate to a ludicrous extent.
- ""it's fair because it would help pay for all the lying propaganda damage you do to society"" indicates a strong negative sentiment towards the addressed party, implying they are harmful.
- phrases ""next!"" and ""on guns, no can do"" exhibit dismissiveness and finality.

### step 2: true intention
- the exaggerated proposal of steep taxes for logging on and speaking indicates a mockery of someone's argument or behavior.
- the use of ""lying propaganda damage"" further indicates a derogatory attitude towards the actions or speech of the person being addressed.
- by juxtaposing these hyperbolic demands with the legal grounding for gun rights, ""scotus has ruled many times,"" there's an implication that the original argument is frivolous or misguided.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the tone set by the exaggerated sentences and strong negative descriptors aligns with mocking and belittling behavior.
- the absurdity of the proposals serves to ridicule the standpoint or actions being discussed.
- the sentiment and true intention both point towards a sarcastic tone, using hyperbole and mock logic to dismiss and undermine another's position.

"Chalk it up to the fact that -- although not all the time -- a good part of the time, the same people are pretty anti-anything education. We shouldn't expect them to argue positions that make sense.",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:** identifying sarcasm in statements.

**example input:** gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the statement's true intention is to mock the character’s ineffectiveness, despite the surface-level excitement. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **keywords and phrases**: phrases like ""nobody has turned up the ark"" and ""termites could assure that if properly used"" are curious and whimsical.
- **surface emotion**: seems somewhat whimsical or humorous, with a hint of absurdity.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the reference to the ark and termites being ravenous after 40 days imply a fantastical yet critical narrative, not intended to be taken literally.
- **language style**: the whimsical mention of termites being able to decompose the ark and become ravenous after 40 days is humorous and irreverent, likely intended to mock the idea.
- **true emotion**: mockery or disbelief towards the idea of the ark’s discovery.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment appears whimsical and slightly absurd.
- the true intention reveals a mocking stance towards the idea of finding the ark, using humor and exaggeration.
- the clear difference between the whimsical surface and the mocking intention supports the identification as sarcastic.

### conclusion:

### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: phrases like ""age of law (the god of swift and harsh justice bit)"" and ""age of grace (the god is all-forgiving bit)"" suggest a certain casual tone with a hint of skepticism or doubt. the phrase ""hang on a minute"" especially indicates a pause for reconsideration, often used when pointing out a flaw or inconsistency.
- **surface emotion**: skepticism or doubt.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of the phrase ""age of law"" and ""age of grace"" with associated simplistic explanations (""the god of swift and harsh justice bit"" and ""the god is all-forgiving bit"") suggests a simplification and mockery of these concepts. the ""hang on a minute"" interrupts the explanation, indicating a realization of absurdity or inconsistency, which is a sarcastic way to point out flaws in reasoning.
- **language style**: the language style is casual and dismissive. the simplification and abrupt halting serve as indicators of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- **surface sentiment**: skepticism or doubt.
- **true intention**: mockery or criticism of the simplistic division between ""age of law"" and ""age of grace,"" suggesting that such divisions are overly simplistic and perhaps absurd.
- **analysis**: the surface sentiment of skepticism aligns with the true intention of mockery. the casual, dismissive tone reinforces that the speaker does not seriously subscribe to the ideas being mentioned, but rather ridicules them.

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""completely full of ****"", ""mockery"", ""you did not bother to watch the video"", ""your normal fashion"", ""simply assumed"", ""poor definition"".
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrases suggest frustration, disbelief, and accusatory tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement uses strong language and accusations, as well as a mocking tone. this suggests that the speaker is not genuinely questioning, but rather making a point about the other person's behavior and assumptions.
- **language style:** the capitalized ""assumed"" and the use of strong language such as ""completely full of ****"" indicate a heightened emotional state and possibly hyperbolic criticism, which can be a mark of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment is of strong criticism and frustration. the true intention appears to be to criticize the other person’s assumptions and actions. the exaggerated language and mocking tone strongly suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic to underscore their point.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**

- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**

### reasoning process:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the phrase ""rather unsurprisingly"" suggests a tone of mock surprise or highlighting something that should be obvious.

2. **true intention:**
   - the sentence points out the self-evident fact that the u.s. constitution doesn't influence australian law, which is a basic and obvious truth.
   - the use of ""rather unsurprisingly"" serves to mock or belittle anyone who might think otherwise.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment appears to state a fact, but the use of ""rather unsurprisingly"" denotes a pretense that this is something unexpected.
   - the intention seems to be to highlight the obviousness of this statement in a mocking or sarcastic manner, suggesting it's ridiculous to consider otherwise.

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the initial phrase ""so you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an uzi"" is hyperbolic and implausible, indicating a mocking tone.
- phrases such as ""wow"" emphasize the disbelief in the stated viewpoint, further intensifying the sarcasm.

#### step 2: true intention
- the statement uses exaggeration (""10 y/o to buy an uzi"") as a rhetorical device to ridicule the idea of minimal gun control.
- the use of hyperbole (""we don't. new murderers and thieves..."") attempts to undermine the opposition by presenting a worst-case, exaggerated scenario.
- the sarcastic ""wow"" serves to belittle the viewpoint being argued against.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is critical and uses hyperbolic examples to mock the opposing viewpoint.
- the true intention, revealed through exaggerated statements and rhetorical questions, confirms the use of sarcasm.

""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

### example label:

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### conclusion:
given the rhetorical style, mocking tone, and insincere elements, the input example is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"".

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

### label: sarcastic

step 1: **surface sentiment**
- the phrase ""what quaint illogic"" indicates a dismissive attitude, suggesting that the logic being critiqued is outdated or foolish.
- the use of ""if anything,"" hints at a sarcastic reversal of the argument, suggesting the opposite of the initial statement.
- phrases like ""an even higher divorce rate than 'normal'"" use quotation marks to mock what is being considered ""normal.""

step 2: **true intention**
- the author is not genuinely explaining the relationship between marriage and divorce. instead, they are mocking the simplistic reasoning that reducing marriages could have no impact on divorce rates.
- the statement suggests that a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages actually highlights a more severe issue, which is contrary to the initial logic being critiqued.

step 3: **comparison and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of mockery and dismissal matches the true intention of ridiculing the logic behind the argument.
- the exaggerated tone and the use of dismissive language indicate that the author is being sarcastic.

### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""wow"", ""proved"", ""big dud"", ""i didn't see"", ""clear refutation"", ""longheld scientific theory"", ""peer reviewed scientific journals"", ""i must have overlooked it"", ""can you give the reference to your article?""
- **sentimental phrases:** the language suggests skepticism and disbelief.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of capitalization in ""proved"" and the skeptical tone in ""wow"" and ""i must have overlooked it"" indicate irony. the author is not genuinely looking for a reference; instead, they are mocking the claim of disproving the big bang theory.
- **language style:** the excessive formality and specific references to scientific journals and articles further highlight the sarcastic tone, as it's unlikely that such a significant scientific claim would be proven by an individual in a casual manner.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface level appears to take the claim seriously but uses exaggerated skepticism and formal language to indicate irony and disbelief.
  
**conclusion:**
- the hyperbolic language and the context of scientific skepticism strongly suggest sarcasm. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1
So are you saying that the people of India aren't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered? Are you saying that the people of India aren't seeking changes so they can arm themselves accordingly so if something like this happens again they'll be better prepared to handle it?,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrasing in the input appears to be critical and concerned. words such as ""upset,"" ""hide,"" ""violently murdered,"" and ""seeking changes"" point toward a serious and concerned tone.

### step 2: true intention
- the series of rhetorical questions (""are you saying that..."") indicates skepticism and incredulity. this suggests that the speaker believes the opposite of what is being stated. the speaker seems to be highlighting what they see as obvious failings and the resultant outrage of the indian people in the face of the described events.

### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment appears critical and concerned, while the true intention reveals skepticism and perhaps criticism directed at the suggestion that people are not upset or seeking changes.
- the use of rhetorical questions often indicates a sarcastic tone because it implies that the underlying message is contrary to the literal wording. here, it implies that the people of india are indeed upset and want changes.

### conclusion
the rhetorical questions suggest that the actual meaning is contrary to the literal words, implying a sarcastic tone.

### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

### reasoning process:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the detailed description of various firearms and preparatory measures, combined with phrases like ""preparedness my friends..."" and ""dear mr. criminal, which house would you like to break into. sincerely, 1 constitutional rights violator and 1 law abiding citizen,"" suggests a mixture of seriousness and satire.
   - the comparison between the writer's extensive arsenal and hypothetical modest defenses of ""vor,"" such as a whistle and pug, adds a mocking tone.

2. **true intention:**
   - the author appears to overly exaggerate their readiness and arsenal, contrasting it sharply with the described ineffectiveness of vor's defensive measures.
   - the language implies that the author believes those with minimal defenses are foolish or naive, using sarcasm to highlight the perceived inadequacy.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment might seem informational about the writer's level of preparedness.
   - however, the exaggerated comparisons and mocking responses, like referring to the hypothetical criminal and contrasting preparedness, highlight a sarcastic intention.

the true intention to mock and ridicule the perceived lack of preparedness in others, combined with the sarcastic comparisons, solidifies the label as ""sarcastic.""",1

### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

**final sarcasm label:**

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""moral standard,"" ""right and wrong,"" ""bull,"" ""opinion or judgment,"" ""imposing,"" ""wrong,"" ""religious people,"" ""religion.""
- sentimental phrases: the use of ""bull"" suggests a strong, confrontational tone. phrases like ""that dog just doesn't hunt"" also imply dismissal of the opposing viewpoint.
- the surface sentiment appears to challenge and dismiss the opposing viewpoint. it shows frustration and confrontation towards the idea that imposing moral or religious viewpoints is inherently wrong.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: the passage uses rhetorical questions (""what? you don't do that?"") and idiomatic expressions (""that dog just doesn't hunt"") to challenge the opposing viewpoint.
- language style: the phrase ""sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt"" indicates a rejection of the opposing argument. the use of ""bull"" is confrontational and indicates disbelief in the opposing view.
- the true intention seems to be defending the right to use religion as a basis for moral and social views and to criticize the idea that doing so is equivalent to imposing those views.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (strong, confrontational tone) aligns with the true intention (defending using religion in moral judgments and social change while dismissing the opposing viewpoint).
- the passage does not appear to be sarcastic; it is directly challenging and dismissive without a contrasting pretense.

### conclusion
the input text does not employ sarcasm but rather directly confronts and dismisses the opposing viewpoint while defending the use of religion in moral and social decisions.

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the inconsistency and illogical nature of literal biblical interpretations. by pointing out the absurdity of such interpretations, the author’s true intention is to mock and ridicule.

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**

"Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view.",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

- sentimental phrases: the comparison to ""a rock's point of view"" implies a dismissive and trivializing attitude towards the idea being critiqued.
- the surface sentiment seems mocking or belittling.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: the exaggeration of writing from a ""rock's point of view"" indicates a hyperbolic dismissal.
- language style: the phrase ""you’re writing from an embryo’s point of view"" suggests sarcastic critique, undermining the premise that an embryo could have a perspective.
- the statement aims to ridicule the idea of considering an embryo’s point of view as equivalent to considering the point of view of an inanimate object, a rock.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking the idea of an embryo having a point of view by comparing it to a rock) contrasts with what it's pretending to convey (the impossibility or absurdity of such views).
- this discrepancy between the surface sentiment and true intention indicates sarcasm.

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**

   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

   - the phrase ""if they truly do exist"" casts doubt on the existence of these organizations, indicating disbelief or irony.

2. **true intention:**
   - the author doesn't genuinely believe these organizations possess scientific rigor.
   - the mention of worshipping a ""god of the gaps"" becoming ""microscopic"" implies the author is mocking the supposed scientific rigor of these organizations, suggesting their importance or credibility is minimal or non-existent.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment comes off as doubtful and mocking, especially with the exaggerated phrasing.
   - the true intention is to ridicule the claim that these organizations have scientific rigor, thus highlighting a disconnect between their supposed expertise and the reality.

### conclusion:
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.",1

### Example:
**context:** identifying sarcasm in statements.

**example input:** gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the statement's true intention is to mock the character’s ineffectiveness, despite the surface-level excitement. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

And many of the questions that creationists ask.,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

---

**step 1: surface sentiment**

the use of the phrase ""gooey cute"" and the question ""how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"" suggests a dismissive and mocking tone. ""gooey cute"" implies an overly sentimental or trivial description, which feels out of place in a serious discussion.

**step 2: true intention**

the true intention behind the statement is to mockingly point out that the subject being discussed has no real relevance to the deeper, more serious context of a philosophy discourse. rhetorical devices like the exaggerated descriptor ""gooey cute"" underscore the disconnect between the topic and the appropriate level of discourse.

**step 3: comparison and analysis**

the surface sentiment of mockery and the true intention of highlighting irrelevance both align, demonstrating a sarcastic tone. the author doesn't genuinely think the subject is ""gooey cute"" in a positive way, but is using sarcasm to criticize the lack of relevance.

**conclusion**

the use of exaggerated and dismissive language confirms the sarcastic nature of the statement.",1

"There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils   It also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.   +It predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument.

        You are a sarcasm classification classifier. Assign a correct label of the Input text from ['Not Sarcastic', 'Sarcastic'].

        ### Input:
        There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils   It also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.   +It predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument. How could anyone argue with your brand of logic? That would be senseless.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the language is heavily loaded with phrases that seem to praise (""you present a brilliant argument"") but are laced with sarcasm. 
- phrases like ""another brilliant deduction"" and ""you are on a roll"" are dripping with irony.
- criticism veiled in praise is a common sarcastic technique.

#### step 2: true intention
- the intent is clearly to mock and deride the other viewpoint by exaggeratedly praising it while simultaneously providing contrary evidence.
- the piece contains a lot of rhetorical questions and exaggerated statements which are classic indicators of sarcasm (e.g., ""why not say, water exist, or sand is?"").
- there's a consistent undertone of belittling the opposing argument, indicating a sarcastic approach.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- both the surface sentiment and the true intention reveal a deep layer of sarcasm.
- the surface appears overly complimentary while meticulously presenting information that contradicts the statements being ""praised.""

by analyzing the language and the intention behind the words, it is evident that the input is sarcastic.",1
"And the moon could fall from the sky, too.",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:** identifying sarcasm in statements.

**example input:** gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the statement's true intention is to mock the character’s ineffectiveness, despite the surface-level excitement. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

        ","### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the phrase ""and the moon could fall from the sky, too"" includes an unexpected and dramatic event (the moon falling from the sky), which is not typically a realistic or casual statement. the surface sentiment could be viewed as whimsical or exaggerated.

2. **true intention:** 
   - the sentence suggests an event that is highly improbable or impossible. using such an unlikely scenario often indicates that the speaker is mocking or dismissing the likelihood of another event or statement. this type of hyperbole is a common hallmark of sarcasm, indicating skepticism or disbelief.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface whimsical exaggeration doesn't align with a genuine expression. instead, it serves to underline the improbability of the mentioned situation.
   - the mismatch between the literal meaning and the conveyed skepticism indicates that the statement is sarcastic. 

**conclusion:** the statement uses hyperbolic language and an improbable scenario to mock or dismiss another event or statement, making it clearly sarcastic. hence, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

### step 1: surface sentiment
- keywords: ""ignorance,"" ""refuse to read,"" ""opinion.""
- sentimental phrases: ""admit your ignorance,"" ""refuse to read.""
- the surface sentiment seems to criticize priscilla's behavior or stance in a negative manner but disguised as a logical conclusion.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: use of phrases like “let me see if i have this right” and ""as mr. jack said, interesting"" indicates a sarcastic tone.
- language style: the statement is framed to appear as genuine consideration but is likely mocking since the conclusion it reaches dismisses priscilla’s actions as inconsistent or illogical.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (appearing critical but formal) contrasts with the true intention (mocking priscilla's inconsistency).
- this contrast between the formal phrasing and the implicit criticism indicates sarcasm.

### conclusion
the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule priscilla's behavior of offering an opinion while refusing to educate herself on the topic.

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- phrases like ""i dunno"" present a seemingly casual, dismissive tone.
- the question ""maybe it was in the third trimester?"" introduces an element of doubt or nonchalance about something that could potentially be serious or require specific knowledge.

#### step 2: true intention
- the combination of ""i dunno"" and the question implies that the speaker is mocking either their own ignorance or the expectation that they should know the answer.
- the phrase ""maybe it was in the third trimester?"" downplays the significance of the timeframe in question, possibly ridiculing the importance placed on the detail by someone else.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the supposed casual tone on the surface contrasts with the underlying mocking or dismissive intention.

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the use of ""hmmm... interesting"" presents a façade of curiosity.
   - the question ""where does this inalienable right derive from and how does it really work?"" seems to suggest genuine interest.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated example of creating ""your own army called islamic jihad of al queda supporters"" and ""develop weapons of mass destruction on your own farm"" is highly unrealistic and hyperbolic, indicating a mockery of the right being discussed.
   - the phrase ""regardless if that organization actually interferes with someone else"" downplays the severity of the hypothetical situation, adding another layer of ridicule.
   - ""as for bootlicking please drop the rethorics and explain how you mean instead"" implies that the speaker views the previous statements or arguments as sycophantic or insincere rhetoric, further showing disdain.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the contrast between the polite surface sentiment and the exaggerated, unrealistic examples creates a dissonance that is characteristic of sarcasm.
   - the overall tone and hyperbolic language are used to mock and undermine the idea being discussed, rather than genuinely explore it.

### Example:
**context:**

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: mocking and critical tone.
- **keywords**: ""way to make a controversial, unsupported assertion.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase implies a form of congratulations, but in a context that indicates the opposite sentiment (congratulations for something negative, which is not genuine).

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""way to make"" is used sarcastically to imply the opposite of what it literally says.
- **language style**: the statement addresses winston in a mocking manner, suggesting that what he did (making an unsupported assertion) is foolish or unwarranted.
- **intended meaning**: the speaker is criticizing winston for making a controversial and unsupported assertion, thereby using sarcasm to highlight the criticism.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment (mocking and critical tone) aligns with the true intention (criticism through sarcasm).
- **inference**: the use of sarcasm is clear because the statement appears to praise winston for something negative, which fits the pattern of sarcastic expressions.

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **clues such as keywords:** ""with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings"", ""if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole"", ""i will try in the future to keep it down to your level.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the statement about accidental deaths seems to present a fact, but the inclusion of ""if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole"" and ""keep it down to your level"" indicates a condescending tone, often a marker for sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the mention of statistical figures juxtaposed against the condescending comment about understanding hyperbole suggests the speaker is implying that the listener's concerns or arguments are trivial or unwarranted.
- **language style:** the heavy use of condescension and exaggeration in phrases like ""if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole"" shows that the speaker is not simply presenting a factual argument but is mocking the listener.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** on the surface, the statement might appear factual due to the mention of statistics. however, the underlying condescension and rhetorical questions suggest sarcasm. the speaker's true intention seems to be to belittle the listener rather than to present a serious argument.
  
**conclusion:** 
- the combination of factual statistical presentation with a condescending and mocking tone strongly suggests sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1
"So you are saying that despite the majority of the public opposing gay marriage, opposing it may be the wrong direction?   Good for you. You're getting it.",1,"

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""wrong again sherlock,"" ""animosity,"" ""immoral left,"" ""hedonistic sexual and moral depravity,"" ""abortions, gay marriage,"" ""contribution to america's image,"" ""if it feels good, do it.""

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the statement ""wrong again sherlock"" is already a conventional sarcastic opener, often used to mock someone's perceived incorrectness or ignorance.
- throughout the text, there's a certain severity and indictment toward the ""left,"" using strong and judgmental language.
- the usage of significant generalization and hyperbolic tone, attributing moral and cultural decline solely to a political group, alongside attributing stereotypical phrases (""if it feels good, do it,"") in a condemnatory manner, suggests a rhetorical device aimed at ridicule.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- surface sentiment (judgmental and condemning) is contrasted with true intention (ridicule and mockery).

**context:**
refining reasoning for determining the sarcasm in the provided example input.

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

### reasoning:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement ""oh, i dunno guys... i think i've been saved"" starts with an uncertain tone and uses ellipses to induce a sense of mock hesitation.
- use of phrases like ""i've been redeemed, by the blood of the lamb..."" and drifting off into ""barbequed lamb.... rare... yumm...."" shifts from a religious sentiment into trivializing it through a culinary analogy.
- the mention of trading ""photos of the holy pink bunny for the shroud of turin"" introduces a nonsensical and mocking element to the discussion.

#### step 2: true intention
- the initial uncertainty and subsequent trivialization of religious redemption suggest a mocking stance towards the concept.
- the detour into talking about ""barbequed lamb"" and ""yumm"" creates a jarring contrast to the serious tone often associated with religious redemption.
- proposing a trade involving ""the holy pink bunny"" for ""the shroud of turin"" ridicules sacred religious artifacts, indicating a mocking tone.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment showed elements of disbelief, trivialization, and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through absurdity and mockery, confirms the sarcastic tone of the input.
- the strong presence of rhetorical devices such as humor, absurdity, and contrast between sacred and trivial topics all validate the sarcastic nature of the input.",1
"Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?",1,"

- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic, given the rhetorical device used and the mismatch between surface and true sentiment.

        ### Input:
        Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""what do you mean 'my ultimate agenda'?"", ""according to the logic presented in the original article: gun owners: discrimination by gun control laws :: serial rapists: discrimination by anti-rape laws""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a combination of frustration, incredulity, and strong opinionation.

**step 2: true intention:**
- the speaker is using an extreme analogy and strong rhetorical questions to criticize the comparison of gun control laws to discriminatory practices and to attack the logic presented in the original article.
- the tone, particularly in the analogy comparing gun owners to serial rapists, is highly provocative and appears designed to highlight the absurdity or perceived extremity of the original argument.
- the speaker’s detailed explanation of the need for regulation while dismissing the notions of fringe views and mental instability shows an attempt to counter an extreme position sarcastically.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- there is a stark contrast between the examples and analogies used (which are extreme and provocative) and the detailed, measured explanation offered for regulation, indicating the true intention is not just informative but also sarcastic.
- the speaker’s tone, particularly in phrases like ""what do you mean 'my ultimate agenda'?"" and the analogy to serial rapists, underlines the sarcastic element present.

**conclusion:**
the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic because the rhetorical devices and analogies used are intended to mock and criticize the opposing viewpoint through exaggerated and ironic comparisons.",1
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
assign a sarcastic label to an input text.

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""whining"" and the entire tone of the statement point towards a dismissive or belittling sentiment.
- **surface emotion**: annoyance or disdain.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of words like ""whining"" suggests the author is dismissing the concerns addressed in the article. 
- **language style**: the tone feels dismissive and sarcastic, aiming to belittle the author's concerns by reducing them to mere ""whining"".
- **true emotion**: disdain towards the author of the article and possibly a belief that the author's concerns are trivial.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface emotion of annoyance or disdain matches well with the true intention, which is to belittle or dismiss the concerns mentioned in the article.
- the dismissive language and the reduction of the author's concerns to ""whining"" are indicators of sarcasm used to trivialize the issue.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the dismissive language and belittling tone are used to mock or trivialize the concerns of the author of the article.",1

### Example:
### context:
you have provided an example input and asked for a refined reasoning process to determine if the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the tone is earnest and argumentative.
- phrases like ""it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions"" indicate a serious and straightforward tone.
- the language used includes expressions of personal beliefs and moral reasoning, such as ""i do have a problem with..."" and ""if i could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to men, i would.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language does not employ rhetorical devices that are typical for sarcasm (e.g., mockery, irony).
- the text is focused on a serious debate about personal responsibility and the ethics of abortion.
- the author consistently addresses their viewpoint with logical arguments rather than using mockery or irony.

#### step 3: compare and analyze
- the surface sentiment suggests a serious and concerned tone.
- the true intention is to argue a point earnestly with underlying moral reasoning and personal beliefs.
- there is no significant contrast between the surface sentiment and the underlying intention that would suggest irony or sarcasm.

### conclusion:
the input text lacks the characteristic mockery, irony, and rhetorical devices typically associated with sarcasm. instead, it presents a serious and straightforward argument. hence, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0

### context:
refining the reasoning process for assigning a ""sarcastic"" label to an input example.

### example input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### conclusion:
given the rhetorical style, mocking tone, and insincere elements, the input example is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"".

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords/phrases: ""like that hasn't been tried before,"" ""it darn sure isn't about crime control,"" ""nefarious excuse,"" ""no doubt sinjin,"" ""while crying wa wa wa wa wa!""
- sentimental phrases: the use of ""/sarcasm,"" ""it darn sure isn't about crime control,"" and ""nefarious excuse"" suggest a dismissive and mocking tone.
- overall, the tone is highly skeptical and contains elements of mockery.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of ""/sarcasm"" explicitly indicates sarcasm. the mocking mimicry of ""while crying wa wa wa wa wa!"" further reinforces the insincerity and sarcastic nature. additionally, rhetorical questions and exaggerated expressions create a dismissive tone.
- language style: the language is exaggerated and hyperbolic, such as ""no doubt some nefarious excuse"" and ""it darn sure isn't about crime control."" this over-the-top style suggests the author doesn't genuinely believe what they're stating and is instead mocking the position.
- true intention: the author intends to criticize and mock the argument or individuals they are referencing, rather than make a sincere statement.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- surface sentiment (skeptical and mocking) aligns with the true intention (criticizing and mocking).
- the explicit use of sarcasm tags and hyperbolic language confirms the sarcastic nature of the text.

### conclusion:
given the explicit markers of sarcasm, exaggeration, and mocking tone, the input text is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1

### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

- the statement contains polite and questioning phrases such as ""do you believe,"" ""how can god hate,"" ""i thought he was true love,"" ""i thought he was unknowable,"" and ""thanks.""
- phrases like ""how can god hate"" and ""i thought he was true love"" reflect confusion or a need for clarification on contradictory ideas about god.

### step 2: true intention
- the speaker questions contradictions in the nature of god, moving from legal and constitutional questions to theological critiques.
- the use of ""scratch that-- i thought he was unknowable"" shifts to a more dismissive tone, questioning commonly held beliefs about god's nature.
- by ending with ""thanks,"" the speaker might be underscoring the contradictions sarcastically rather than genuinely seeking answers.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is inquisitive and polite, but the true intention reveals skepticism and possible disbelief about the points being discussed.
- the transition from seemingly sincere questions to rhetorical and sarcastic undertones highlights contradictions in typical religious beliefs about god.
- the use of ""scratch that"" and the rhetorical nature of questioning god's attributes points to a mocking tone.

reasoning process:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase ""well maybe that will teach him to get a education for once"" starts with a seemingly constructive suggestion although it contains a grammatical error (""a education"" instead of ""an education"").
   - the phrase ""my analogy is quite true"" suggests confidence in their statement.
   - the phrase ""dishonest, but that is essentialy the mantra of creationism"" indicates a negative sentiment towards creationism.
   - the sarcastic tone is emphasized by the exaggeration in ""lie, cheat, steal and fabricate to get people to believe.""

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the true intention begins to surface with ""well maybe that will teach him to get a education for once,"" which hints at criticism or a condescending attitude.
   - the phrase ""my analogy is quite true"" may imply the speaker's certainty in their judgment, suggesting they believe their analogy is undeniably factual.
   - the statement ""dishonest, but that is essentialy the mantra of creationism"" reflects a clear contempt for creationism.
   - the hyperbole ""lie, cheat, steal and fabricate to get people to believe"" further highlights the sarcastic intention by exaggerating the perceived tactics of creationists.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention reveals clear sarcasm. the opening appears to be advising but is actually mocking. 
   - there's a mix of overt negativity and underlying mockery towards specific beliefs, exposing a sarcastic tone.

by analyzing the surface sentiment and the true intention and observing the contrast, it's evident that the statement is dripping with sarcasm.

"Or, given that this is about feasts, a waist is a terrible thing to mind.",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""a waist is a terrible thing to mind.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase is a play on words from the saying ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste,"" making use of unexpected word substitution.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase is a pun, indicating a humorous intention. the unexpected substitution of ""waist"" for ""mind"" creates an ironic twist.
- **language style:** such humorous and clever wordplay is often indicative of sarcasm, intending to amuse rather than convey a serious message.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the statement on the surface may seem to be making a serious observation about feasts leading to weight gain, but the clever twist and humor suggest that it's not serious. the irony inherent in the wordplay implies sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
- the use of a pun and irony to convey a humorous message strongly indicates sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **sentiment clues**: critical and skeptical tone.
- **keywords**: ""want guns,"" ""protect themselves,"" ""burglars,"" ""pull off another revolution,"" ""call others full of fear and mistrust"".
- **sentimental phrases**: the phrase ""just in case we need to pull off another revolution"" and ""call others full of fear and mistrust"" both suggest a tone of irony and skepticism.

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: the phrase “less than a playstation, of course!” seems to downplay or trivialize a comparison.
- **surface emotion**: casual, possibly dismissive.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase “of course!” suggests a pretense that the comparison is obvious, implying that whatever is being compared to a playstation is much less significant or not as valuable.
- **language style**: the casual tone and the use of “of course!” indicate that the speaker does not genuinely believe the comparison is straightforward or valid.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is casual and possibly dismissive.
- the true intention, revealed through the use of ""of course!,"" suggests that the speaker is mocking the validity of the comparison.
- the mismatch between the casual surface sentiment and the underlying mockery indicates sarcasm.

Do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant?",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the phrase ""do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant?"" uses a rhetorical question that suggests incredulity.
   - the use of quotation marks around ""conception"" suggests a mocking tone or disbelief.

2. **true intention:**

### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

### label: sarcastic

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the statement mentions arguments from creationists, raising questions that seem to mock the presentation. phrases like ""most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment"" and the rhetorical question ""you don't seriously propose that your little series of cow pies is actually meaningful, do you?"" suggest a dismissive and scornful tone, implying criticism rather than genuine interest.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the true intention behind the statement is to deride and belittle the arguments and the presentation in question. the phrase ""your little series of cow pies"" indicates a strong sense of disdain and the use of rhetorical questions signals that the speaker is not seeking an actual response but rather making a point about the perceived lack of value in the arguments.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the contrast between the seemingly exaggerated positive language (""most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment"") and the actual intent to mock and criticize (highlighted by the demeaning term ""cow pies"" and rhetorical questions) is indicative of sarcasm. the surface sentiment is one of exaggerated interest and praise, while the true intention is to express derision and skepticism.

the discrepancy between the apparent enthusiasm and the underlying contempt clearly signifies a sarcastic tone. therefore, the statement is labeled as sarcastic.",1

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        By far most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech.

### label: not sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the text contains phrases such as ""most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech,"" ""you've been listening to too much propaganda,"" and ""demonizing and working toward persecuting christians."" these phrases indicate a predominantly serious and critical tone.
   - there are no signs of exaggerated gratitude, rhetorical questions, or other indicators that might point to sarcasm.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the true intention seems to be a straightforward argument or critique. the writer appears to be expressing a genuine belief or opinion, possibly from a conservative standpoint.
   - there is no significant use of irony or rhetorical questions that would typically indicate sarcasm. the focus is on arguing against the perception of ""hate speech"" and criticizing ""gay lobby groups,"" which seems to be the writer's genuine stance.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - comparing the surface sentiment with the true intention, there is no evident contrast. both align to convey a serious critique, without any detectable layer of sarcasm.
   - since the content matches straightforward critique and argumentation, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0
"Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""prove something besides your ignorance?"", ""i can see why people are laughing at you""
- **sentimental phrases:** the use of ""your ignorance"" and the phrase ""i can see why people are laughing at you"" suggest a mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the phrase ""prove something besides your ignorance?"" is a rhetorical question meant to ridicule rather than solicit a serious response. the declaration ""i can see why people are laughing at you"" is an attempt to belittle and mock the person.
- **language style:** the overall language is derisive and dismissive, indicative of sarcasm.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface remarks show a confrontational and mocking attitude, the use of rhetorical questions and derogatory comments reveals the true intention of sarcasm meant to belittle and criticize.

### conclusion:
- the mocking and confrontational language, combined with rhetorical questions, strongly suggest that the text is sarcastic. hence, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

### Example:
### context:
assign a sarcastic label to an input text.

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

**step 1: surface sentiment**

- **keywords and phrases**: ""start with one of those unreasonable and dumb arguments,"" ""you are unreasonable and dumb,"" and ""i can claim that invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky.""
- **surface emotion**: mockery, disdain, frustration.

**step 2: true intention**

- **rhetorical devices**: hyperbole (e.g., ""invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky""), and the repetition of ""unreasonable and dumb,"" are used to derisively challenge the person's arguments.
- **language style**: the language is heavily provocative and dismissive, aiming to ridicule the other person's stance on evolution.
- **true emotion**: strong criticism and disdain towards the person’s reasoning abilities and arguments about evolution.

**step 3: compare and analysis**

- the surface sentiment shows a tone of mockery and disdain.
- the true intention is clearly to criticize and ridicule, which becomes apparent through hyperbolic comparisons and repeated derogatory phrases.
- the discrepancy between the surface sentiment (mockery) and true intention (criticism through exaggerated and derisive language) indicates the use of sarcasm to convey the criticism.

### Example:
**context:** identifying sarcasm in statements.

**example input:** gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the statement's true intention is to mock the character’s ineffectiveness, despite the surface-level excitement. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- words and phrases like ""sure let me have your sermon/propaganda"" indicate a negative sentiment.
- mention of ""propaganda"" and ""misinformation"" carries strong negative connotations.
- the sarcastic use of ""sure"" can add a disingenuous or mocking tone.

#### step 2: true intention
- the use of ""sermon/propaganda of misinformation"" implies a strong disagreement with the other person's perspective.
- mentioning specific religious texts (e.g., job 32) to counter the other person's argument implies that the speaker is trying to discredit the other’s points with authority.
- the detailed definition of words like ""propaganda"" and ""misinform"" is likely an attempt to belittle the other person.
- the overall tone is dismissive and condescending.

#### step 3: compare and analysis
- the initial response with ""sure"" combined with ""sermon/propaganda of misinformation"" and the detailed definition of terms creates a significant mismatch between surface politeness and actual content.
- the use of scriptural references to invalidate the opposing view adds to the mocking and dismissive tone.

### conclusion:
- the combination of mocking, condescending language with an outwardly simple ""sure"" indicates sarcasm.

### Example:
### context:
you have provided an example input and asked for a refined reasoning process to determine if the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the statement uses a factual tone but in a context that dismisses the original argument.
- keywords such as ""probably"" can indicate a dismissive attitude.

#### step 2: true intention
- the sentence attempts to dismiss a possibly absurd analogy or counterargument by stating an obvious fact.
- the suggestion that the reason is plainly obvious (""probably"" indicating a suggestion or guess) might trivialize the original argument, making it appear foolish.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the seemingly straightforward statement actually belittles the counterpart's argument by making it seem evident that buildings can't be compared with biological or reproductive entities.
- this trivialization through an ostensibly obvious fact aligns with a sarcastic tone.

### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""how informative.""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""how informative"" is very brief and lacks specific emotional indicators, but it is significant.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""how informative"" is an example of verbal irony, where the literal meaning is different from the intended meaning.
- language style: the brevity and the phrasing suggest the speaker finds the information lacking in actual informative content.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment appears to praise the information as being informative.
- the true intention, indicated by the sarcastic phrasing, actually implies the opposite—that the information is not informative at all.
 
the contrast between the surface sentiment and the true intention shows the use of sarcasm.

   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the negative sentiment of ""complete fabrication."" appears to convey disbelief and skepticism.

### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### surface sentiment:
- the phrase ""in other words"" suggests an explanation or re-interpretation of someone else's statement.
- the use of ""old man"" and ""did something criminal and broke the law"" adds a critical tone.
- ""admit it."" is accusatory and challenges the other person's stance, suggesting an emotional undertone.

### true intention:
- the sentence insinuates that the other person is deriving happiness from someone's criminal actions, a notion likely perceived as absurd or hypocritical by the author.
- the critical and accusatory language (""criminal"", ""broke the law"", ""admit it."") implies that the author doesn't seriously believe the other person is genuinely happy about the criminal act, but is instead using this as a point of critique.
- the implication of ""admit it."" serves as a rhetorical device to mock the other person's presumed position, insinuating that it is unreasonable or contradictory.

### comparison and analysis:
- the surface sentiment appears confrontational and accusatory.
- the true intention, however, seems to be to mock or challenge the other person's stance using sarcasm by highlighting an absurd interpretation of their view.

"Wonder what ""euthanization"" is. Never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary.",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:** identifying sarcasm in statements.

**example input:** gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the statement's true intention is to mock the character’s ineffectiveness, despite the surface-level excitement. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the phrase ""wonder what 'euthanization' is. never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary"" appears curious or inquisitive on the surface.

2. **true intention:**
   - the term ""euthanization"" is widely known and understood, which makes claiming ignorance seem insincere.
   - the phrase ""neither has the dictionary"" is an exaggeration, implying that something well-known is being ignored or downplayed.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the curious tone of surface sentiment contrasts heavily with the intended mockery or criticism of the term being discussed.
   - the exaggeration used indicates sarcasm, as the speaker is not genuinely seeking information but rather making a point about the word's known meaning or common usage.

**conclusion:** the mismatch between the surface-level curiosity and the underlying mockery signifies sarcasm. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

### Example:
### context:
refining the reasoning process for assigning a ""sarcastic"" label to an input example.

### example input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### conclusion:
given the rhetorical style, mocking tone, and insincere elements, the input example is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"".

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence,"" ""you mean like bill ayers (sic) and his wife or carl rowen?"" the surface sentiment appears dismissive and mocking.
- sentimental phrases: comparison to an oxymoron suggests a disbelief in the concept of reasonable gun regulation.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the term ""oxymoron"" and the comparison to ""military intelligence"" imply that the author finds the idea of reasonable gun regulation inherently contradictory and absurd. mentioning individuals like bill ayers and carl rowen with a sarcastic ""wait my bad they aren't from the right"" indicates ridicule towards those who support gun regulation.
- language style: the overall style is mocking and dismissive, showing contempt for the concept being discussed.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: the surface sentiment (dismissive and mocking tone) aligns with the true intention (ridicule and skepticism).
- inference: the use of comparisons, rhetorical questions, and sarcastic comments points out that the input is meant to mock the idea of reasonable gun regulation rather than engage in a genuine discussion.

- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""you do feel,"" ""forgiveness,"" ""one question,"" ""just curious,"" ""imo,"" ""forgiven,"" ""hope you don't do it again.""
- the surface sentiment seems to be a mix of inquiry, asserted belief, and a cautionary note, wrapped in politeness and curiosity.

**step 2: true intention:**
- the emphasis on ""do feel"" and the layered questioning about motivations for starting the thread add an edge of incredulity or passive-aggressiveness.
- the phrase ""just curious"" often implies that the inquiry is rhetorical or accusatory rather than a genuine search for information.
- the closing statement ""but i hope you don't do it again"" carries a judgmental undertone despite being phrased politely, suggesting disapproval wrapped in concern.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (polite inquiry and concern) contrasts with the true intention (judgment and incredulity).
- the mismatch between the surface politeness and the underlying skepticism and judgment indicates sarcasm. 

**conclusion:**
- the use of rhetorical questions, emphasis on words, and judgmental undertones in polite phrasing strongly suggest sarcasm.",1

### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

**reasoning process:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the rhetoric in the statement (“are you anti-choice folk going to force us,” “re-education jails,” “believe that a fertilized egg is a human being”) uses strong, confrontational language that suggests antagonism and disbelief rather than genuine inquiry.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the speaker's language indicates skepticism and mockery. terms like “re-education jails” and characterizing the opposition's view as believing “that a fertilized egg is a human being” suggest that the speaker feels the opposing viewpoint is extreme and nonsensical. 
   - the rhetorical questions imply the speaker expects no genuine dialogue but is instead highlighting what they perceive as absurdity or coercion on part of the opposition.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment carries a tone of sarcasm through the exaggerated rhetoric and confrontational language.
   - the true intention combines frustration with mockery, revealing an ironic stance on the opposition's perspective.
   - the discrepancy between the strong negative language and the underlying skepticism and mockery illustrates sarcasm.

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:
1. **surface sentiment:**
   - phrases like ""oh! did you mean something like this"" and ""machine guns are for sissy american felons"" have a mocking undertone.
   - the phrase ""real felons in gun free france use anti-tank weapons"" is an exaggerated and ironic statement, indicating disbelief and mockery.

2. **true intention:**
   - the author doesn't genuinely believe that france's gun control is leading to felons using anti-tank weapons or that american felons are sissy for using machine guns.
   - the use of sarcasm here is to challenge the effectiveness of gun-free policies by presenting an absurd and exaggerated counterexample.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment appears to mockingly acknowledge a point about gun control in france, while the true intention is to ridicule the idea that gun control policies are effectively preventing crime.
   - the exaggerated comparisons and the ironic tone indicate sarcasm. 

thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1
We DID learn about selective hearing in health class.,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
refining the reasoning process for assigning a ""sarcastic"" label to an input example.

### example input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### conclusion:
given the rhetorical style, mocking tone, and insincere elements, the input example is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"".

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""learn about selective hearing,"" ""health class""
- sentimental phrases: none specifically
- overall, the tone appears educational or informative on the surface.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""we did learn about selective hearing in health class"" is emphasizing ""did"" to presumably highlight that the learning was ineffective or ignored.
- language style: the capitalization of ""did"" indicates an implied contradiction between what was supposed to be learned and the actual behavior, suggesting irony.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: the surface sentiment is seemingly factual or educational, while the true intention, highlighted by the capitalized ""did,"" suggests irony or mockery of the supposed learning.
- inference: the use of capitalization and the context implies that the statement is mocking the effectiveness or retention of health class education. 

### conclusion:
given the use of rhetorical emphasis and the implied contradiction, it indicates sarcasm. the input example is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"".",1

### Example:
**context:**
refining reasoning for determining the sarcasm in the provided example input.

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

What Would Jesus Carry?,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you have provided an example input and asked for a refined reasoning process to determine if the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""what would jesus carry?"" seems neutral on the surface and does not immediately convey a strong emotional sentiment. however, the question form can hint towards a rhetorical device.

#### step 2: true intention
- the phrase mimics the well-known phrase ""what would jesus do?"" which is traditionally used in moral or ethical decision-making contexts.
- by substituting ""do"" with ""carry,"" the speaker is likely making a rhetorical or sarcastic point, questioning or trivializing what possessions or burdens jesus would actually carry.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment does not reveal much negative sentiment, but the rhetorical question's underlying intention appears to trivialize or satirize religious or moral guidance by reducing it to a discussion about physical objects.
- the juxtaposition of a sacred question being altered for a mundane or mocking purpose supports the presence of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
given the use of a rhetorical device that subverts an otherwise serious question, the input fits the characteristics of sarcasm despite lacking overt negative keywords or explicitly sentimental phrases.",1

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

- **surface emotion**: the tone appears accusatory and dismissive, with a sense of frustration.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrases ""it's obvious"" and ""nothing will ever change your mind"" suggest a sarcastic tone, as it implies the speaker believes the other party is stubborn and irrational. the use of ""your mind is not made up on the evidence"" further emphasizes skepticism toward the opponent's reasoning.
- **language style**: the overall style is one of mockery, insinuating that the opponent's beliefs are unfounded and based on an ideology rather than evidence.
- **true emotion**: the speaker actually doubts the opponent's rationality and is criticizing their closed-mindedness.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is dismissive and accusatory.
- the true intention is to mock and criticize the opponent’s strong adherence to their beliefs, implying that it is irrational.

### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - phrases like ""suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go"" and ""we should also get them to stop pooping"" present an exaggerated and unrealistic suggestion that hints at mockery.
   - the use of absolute terms like ""always"" and comparing a behavior to an extreme example (stopping pooping) indicate a lack of serious intent.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated suggestions meant to highlight the absurdity of suppressing natural behavior.
   - the phrase suggests that the author does not genuinely agree with suppressing natural behavior and uses an extreme example to emphasize their point.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the surface sentiment seems to endorse suppressing behavior, but the extreme nature of the example and the clear exaggeration point to ridicule of the concept.
   - the true intention, highlighted by the exaggerated example, is to mock the idea of suppressing natural behaviors rather than genuinely supporting it.

**example input:**
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic, given the rhetorical device used and the mismatch between surface and true sentiment.

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""no i can't marry them,"" ""some of them are married,"" ""none have intent to live within mass.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be straightforward, providing reasons why marriage isn't possible.

**step 2:** **true intention:**

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- there is no apparent rhetorical device or mocking tone detected within the sentence. the phrases used are factual and lack any element of irony or sarcasm.
- the lack of an exaggerated or contrasting punchline also suggests the statement is literally meant.

**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords: ""alas,"" ""who gives a damn?""
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""who gives a damn?"" carries a dismissive and indifferent sentiment. the word ""alas"" introduces a sense of regret or lament.
- the surface sentiment seems dismissive and critical.

**step 2: true intention:**
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""who gives a damn?"" is likely not sincere but is used to highlight a perceived lack of concern. the word ""alas"" adds to the irony.
- language style: the context suggests a critique of people's attitudes toward fetuses versus orphans, using a rhetorical question to emphasize neglect or lack of care.
- the true intention appears to criticize a lack of concern for orphans, highlighting hypocrisy by contrasting it with the concern for fetuses.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (dismissiveness indicated by ""who gives a damn?"") contrasts sharply with the true intention (criticizing societal attitudes towards orphans).
- this contrast between surface sentiment and true intention indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to criticize the disparity in concern for fetuses versus orphans. the dismissive language and use of rhetorical questioning point towards sarcasm.",1

context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        ### Label: 

        ","### response:

### label: sarcastic

---

### reasoning process:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""oh! i get it!"" which indicates an exclamatory and seemingly understanding tone.
   - however, the statement ""abortion is fun"" carries a controversial and provocative phrase, suggesting sarcasm given the serious nature of the topic.
   - the continuation ""it is only a traumatic experience (to kill your unborn son/daughter) for 'unbalanced' women"" uses quotation marks around ""unbalanced"" which adds a layer of mockery or disbelief towards labeling women in such a situation.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the speaker likely does not genuinely believe that abortion is fun, as this contrasts strongly with societal views and the heavy emotional context of abortion.
   - the use of the term ""unbalanced"" in quotation marks implies that the speaker is mocking or challenging those who trivialize the trauma of abortion or stigmatize women facing such a situation.
   - the dramatic phrasing and controversial nature of the statements strongly indicate the speaker's critical and sarcastic stance on the issue.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment suggests an understanding and light-hearted tone initially but quickly shifts to inappropriate and provocative statements.
   - the true intention shows irony and criticism of those who diminish the seriousness of abortion.
   - this contrast between surface sentiment and true intention is a clear indicator of sarcasm.",1

### Example:
**context:**
refining reasoning for determining the sarcasm in the provided example input.

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

        ","### response:

### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: the phrase ""science and common sense are irrelevant in their world"" suggests a critical and dismissive sentiment.
- **keywords**: ""value science and common sense,"" ""irrelevant.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of ""irrelevant in their world"" sarcastically dismisses the value placed on science and common sense.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses irony to emphasize the contradiction between valuing science/common sense and the perceived dismissal of these values in the mentioned world.
- **language style**: the juxtaposition of ""value science and common sense"" with ""science and common sense are irrelevant"" underscores a mocking tone.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing a group who they believe dismisses science and common sense, using sarcasm to underscore their perceived irrationality.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the critical and dismissive surface sentiment aligns with the mocking and ironic true intention.
- **inference**: the alignment between the surface mockery and the underlying criticism lends strong support to the sarcastic label.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:** identifying sarcasm in statements.

**example input:** gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:** 
   - the word ""gee"" typically suggests surprise or excitement.
   - ""comic relief"" usually refers to a humorous character or element.
   - surface level sentiment appears light-hearted and possibly positive.

2. **true intention:** 
   - ""thimble wearing"" could imply a character who is delicate or overly cautious, an unexpected trait for someone providing comic relief.
   - the phrase ""slides in"" might suggest a lack of importance or a sneaky entrance.
   - combined, these elements create an image that the character's presence is being mocked or not taken seriously.

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the surface sentiment of excitement doesn't match the underlying mockery or disdain.
   - the contrast between the playful tone and the implied derision indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the statement's true intention is to mock the character’s ineffectiveness, despite the surface-level excitement. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the phrase ""show us that britain is just fine"" appears to seek evidence of a positive condition.
   - ""show us that the criminals aren't awarded more protection than their victims"" seems to call for evidence indicating a balanced legal system.
   - the usage of ""show us thimble head"" is derogatory and introduces a mocking tone.
   - the concluding phrase ""show us or shut up"" is confrontational and dismissive.

2. **true intention:**
   - the demand for proving something that is implied to be incorrect or impossible suggests an underlying disbelief.
   - the phrase ""thimble head"" adds a mocking insult, indicating impatience and disdain.
   - the overall tone, particularly ending with ""shut up,"" aggressively challenges the opposing stance, implying ridicule. 

3. **comparison and analysis:** 
   - the initial requests seem to be looking for evidence, which could be seen as constructive or inquisitive.
   - however, the true intention revealed by the mocking and dismissive language shows that the speaker does not believe such evidence exists and is ridiculing the notion.

**conclusion:** the apparent disbelief and mockery inherent in the request to ""show us"" evidence that is presumed not to exist, along with the derogatory language, indicate a sarcastic tone. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

- the surface sentiment appears to reference a well-known figure, spock from star trek, typically associated with logical thinking.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the statement ""logic dictates that logic need not apply"" contradicts itself, creating a paradox.
- spock, as a symbol of pure logic, would never suggest that logic should not apply, thus implying that the statement is intentionally ironic.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (reference to logic and spock) contrasts with the true intention (paradox and irony).
- this contradiction and the use of spock, known for logical reasoning, in an illogical context strongly indicate sarcasm.

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning:
#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the initial question ""so you're a historian now?"" uses a rhetorical device that immediately suggests sarcasm.
- statements like ""yes, you are right"" followed by explanations seems initially conciliatory but quickly shifts tone to condescending.
- the challenge ""according to who?"" questions the legitimacy of the other person's knowledge in a mocking way.
- the repetitive emphasis on ""someone who actually had knowledge about the civil war would certainly know"" has a dismissive and belittling tone.
- the statement ""and i don't expect you to"" carries a dismissive implication underscoring mock pity or disdain.

#### step 2: true intention
- the rhetorical question ""so you're a historian now?"" aims to belittle the other person's authority on the subject.
- the statement ""yes, you are right - the civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. but, it is also a fact..."" sets up a false agreement only to undermine the person's knowledge.
- mocking the other person’s lack of knowledge multiple times suggests underlying derision and contempt.
- the phrase ""i don't expect you to"" implies the person is incapable of understanding or proving their standpoint, which is sarcastic.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment involves condescension, mockery, and dismissiveness.
- the true intention verified through rhetorical questions and belittling statements confirms sarcasm.
- there’s a sharp contrast between the ostensible agreement and actually undermining the person's credibility, confirming sarcasm.

""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

        or
        You think step by step if your confidence in your judgment is less than 90%:
        Step 1: What is the SURFACE sentiment, as indicated by clues such as keywords, sentimental phrases, emojis?
        Step 2: Deduce what the sentence really means, namely the TRUE intention, by carefully checking any rhetorical devices, language style, etc.
        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

**final sarcasm label:**

i dunno. what is the scoop here? you complain about the responses we give, and yet you keep coming back for more. even people with down syndrome learn enough to only stick their hands in the open flame once.

### response:

### label: 
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords: ""what is the scoop here?"", ""you complain"", ""keep coming back for more"", ""even people with down syndrome""
- sentimental phrases: the comparison to people with down syndrome in the context of learning from mistakes adds a derogatory negative sentiment.
- the surface sentiment is highly condescending and mocking in nature.

**step 2: true intention:**
- rhetorical devices: use of rhetorical questions in ""what is the scoop here?"" and the hyperbolic comparison to people with down syndrome.
- language style: the phrases ""you keep coming back for more"" and ""even people with down syndrome"" indicate mockery and an intention to belittle.
- the true intention is to ridicule and belittle the subject of the complaint. the phrase ""you keep coming back for more"" implies that the person being addressed is not learning from previous negative experiences.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (mocking and condescending) matches the statement's true intention (to belittle and ridicule).
- there is clear evidence of sarcasm as the statement pretends to show concern or ask for information but is actually mocking the person's actions or intelligence.

**conclusion:**
the overall tone and phrasing of the input text indicate a sarcastic intention to ridicule the person being addressed. the negative and derogatory language confirms this.

**final sarcasm label:**

"It was a pretty clear rebuttle of the idea that the ToE breeds social elitism, Marxism, and Nazisim.   I guess you're right though, SS. This wasn't nearly as entertaining as a slough of out-of-context quotes to show that ToE-accepting biologists reject the ToE.",1,"

### Example:
### context:
assign a sarcastic label to an input text.

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

- **keywords and phrases**: phrases like ""i guess you're right though"" suggest concessive language, while terms like ""clear rebuttle"" [sic] and ""entertaining as a slough"" indicate a derisive tone.
- **surface emotion**: possible resignation or agreement masking deeper sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of the phrase ""pretty clear rebuttle"" combined with ""i guess you're right though"" and following with ""this wasn't nearly as entertaining as a slough of out-of-context quotes"" indicates the speaker doesn't sincerely believe what they are stating.
- **language style**: the phrases chosen imply the opposite of what the words mean, a key indicator of sarcasm.
- **true emotion**: the speaker is mocking the idea and showing disdain for the use of out-of-context quotes to reject the toe (theory of evolution).

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment seems to be a reluctant agreement or admiration.
- the true intention, inferred from the sarcastic language and rhetorical devices, reveals that the speaker is actually mocking the idea and showing contempt.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the passage contains a mixture of descriptive language focused on the physics of wood and shipbuilding.
   - the use of terms like ""poof! goddidit!"" and ""why didn't god just poof the ark into existence"" introduces a mocking tone.
   - there is explicit skepticism toward the creationist view, especially evident in phrases like ""of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer.""

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the central intention of the passage is to critique and mock the creationist explanation for the ark's feasibility.
   - there is a clear use of irony and rhetorical questions to challenge the logic behind the creationist beliefs like ""why didn't god just poof the ark into existence?""
   - the sarcasm is evident in the exaggerated language and the pointed question about noah getting drunk as a way to undermine the seriousness of the biblical story.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the contrast between the detailed, somewhat technical description of wood constraints and the sudden shift to mocking language indicates sarcasm.
   - the speaker uses scientific reasoning as a setup to highlight the absurdity of the creationist view through sarcastic commentary.
   - the surface sentiment appears earnest and technical initially, but the true intention is to ridicule the opposing view.

### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment
- **clues such as keywords:** ""human responsibility,"" ""brother's keeper,"" ""aren't enough jobs,"" ""medical care are skyrocketing,"" ""drop dead""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""just drop dead?"" seems to introduce an extreme and unlikely suggestion as a reaction to a real problem.

### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of the question ""just drop dead?"" employs hyperbole and possibly irony. it's asking a rhetorical question, likely not suggesting literally that people should ""just drop dead,"" but instead highlighting the dire situation and the absence of practical solutions.
- **language style:** the language becomes exaggerated towards the end, indicating possible sarcasm to emphasize frustration or criticism about the lack of solutions to serious issues like job scarcity and high medical costs.

### step 3: compare and analyze
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment appears extreme when suggesting ""just drop dead?"" which contrasts with the original discussion about responsibility and societal concerns. the hyperbolic suggestion indicates a sarcastic undertone emphasizing the seriousness of the problems being discussed.

### conclusion
- considering the use of hyperbole and the tone shift towards the end, the statement appears to have a sarcastic undertone to emphasize the critic's point.

**example input:**
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic, given the rhetorical device used and the mismatch between surface and true sentiment.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**  
- keywords and phrases: ""but what if it is unconstitutional, like prop. 8,"" ""are you saying homosexuals aren't american?,"" ""how dare them fight for their own freedoms?,"" ""i should lend you my time machine""
- these phrases suggest a confrontational and loaded discourse, questioning civil rights and historical context, and employing hyperbole.

**step 2:** **true intention:**  
- the rhetorical questions and usage of hyperbole, e.g., ""how dare them fight for their own freedoms?"" and mentioning ""malcom x"" in the context of the argument, indicate irony and mockery.
- the writer is likely opposing the view that opposes rights for homosexuals and is using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of such a viewpoint.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**  
- the surface sentiment, which appears confrontational and questioning, contrasts with the true intention, which is mocking and ironic.
- the rhetorical device of hyperbolic questioning and reference to historical figures for ironic comparison suggests sarcasm.

### context:
you have provided an example input and asked for a refined reasoning process to determine if the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- phrases like ""here's a novel idea"" and ""just a thought"" are used in a context that indicates a dismissive tone.
- the term ""scientifically unproven"" is used to discredit abstinence programs with a hint of sarcasm.
- suggesting that improving access and information on birth control (b/c) to ""stop women having upps"" (unplanned pregnancies) carries an implied criticism of current policies, making it sound like a simple, obvious solution the other party is ignoring.

#### step 2: true intention
- the phrase ""here's a novel idea"" often precedes a suggestion that the speaker believes is obvious yet overlooked, pointedly highlighting the perceived ignorance or stubbornness of the other side.
- the rhetorical nature of the statement frames the suggestion as something that should be common sense but is not adopted, indicating that the speaker is mocking the current stance or policies.
- ""just a thought"" is a dismissive conclusion, often used to undercut the severity or complexity of the issue in a sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is dismissive and critical.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        ### Label: 

        ","### response:
to determine the appropriate label for the input text, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process described.

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""and yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children..."" contains emotionally charged words such as ""murdering innocent children."" 
- the tone appears to be accusatory and negative.

#### step 2: true intention
- the sentence uses hyperbolic language and a generalization about liberal democrats which suggests the use of irony.
- it's highly unlikely that the speaker genuinely believes that ""liberal democrats"" are advocating for the murder of innocent children.
- the use of irony aims to criticize or mock the viewpoint that liberal democrats support actions perceived as harmful, using an extreme example to drive the point home.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- there's a significant discrepancy between the literal words (liberal democrats supporting murder) and the likely intended meaning (criticizing or mocking what the speaker perceives as a liberal democrat stance).
- this contrast between the accusatory surface sentiment and the underlying sarcastic intent reveals a sarcastic tone.

you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""hehehehehehe,"" ""that made me laugh,"" ""i am just a theory""
- **sentimental phrases:** the laughter and the exaggerated capitalized statement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the initial laughter (""hehehehehehe"") and the phrase ""that made me laugh"" suggest a mocking or dismissive tone. the exaggeration in ""i am just a theory"" indicates it's mocking the idea of labeling theories in a way that would make them appear untrustworthy or overly simplistic.
- **language style:** the entire tone of the text uses hyperbole and mockery, suggesting that the speaker is not genuinely supporting the idea of such labeling but is instead criticizing it in a sarcastic manner.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment seems humorous and exaggerated, indicating it shouldn't be taken literally. the true intention is to mock the idea of labeling theories in such a simplistic way, suggesting a sarcastic undertone.

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

- **keywords and phrases**: phrases like ""unicorns breathe toxic gas"" and ""can get around all they want"" suggest an exaggeration.
- **surface emotion**: mild confusion or sarcastic disbelief.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""unicorns"" and the absurd qualities like ""breathe toxic gas"" and ""low density"" indicate a fantastical and imaginary scenario designed to mock or dismiss the question ""what's your point?""
- **language style**: over-the-top and whimsical language used to highlight the ridiculousness of the claim.
- **true emotion**: the speaker is likely dismissing the original point by using an absurd example to highlight its perceived irrelevance or confusion.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment carries a tone of mild confusion or disbelief.
- the true intention, revealed through absurd and fantastical claims, suggests that the original question is being mocked or dismissed.

### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""killing children,"" ""george bush,"" ""killing of thousands of children in iraq.""
- sentimental phrases: the sentence provides a harsh criticism of george bush, associating him with the death of children.
- overall, the surface sentiment is negative and accusatory towards george bush.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""who is killing children?"" implies an open question, but the follow-up (""except for george bush"") provides a definite, accusatory answer, indicating sarcasm.
- language style: the sentence makes a strong assertion that blames george bush directly for the deaths, using what seems to be an exaggerated or ironic tone.
- the true intention appears to be to criticize george bush harshly by sarcastically suggesting that he is responsible for killing children.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (criticizing george bush) and the phrasing of the statement (rhetorical question followed by a pointed accusation) together suggest that the statement is using sarcasm to underline its true intention.
- this contrast and the accusatory style indicate that the statement is sarcastic in nature.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to criticize george bush, attributing the idea of ""killing children"" to him in a hyperbolic and ironic manner, thus making the statement sarcastic.

well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic, given the rhetorical device used and the mismatch between surface and true sentiment.

""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: not sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""watch yourself"", ""watch it""
- **sentimental phrases:** these phrases suggest a warning or caution but do not in themselves indicate sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** there are no obvious rhetorical devices or language styles that suggest sarcasm.
- **language style:** the repetitive emphasis indicates a serious tone rather than a playful or ironic one.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment of caution or warning aligns with the likely true intention of prompting someone to behave or be careful. there is no indication of irony or hyperbole.

therefore, the statement ""hey, watch yourself.........watch it.."" is best classified as ""not sarcastic.""",0

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you have provided an example input and asked for a refined reasoning process to determine if the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

- there is a consistent tone of disdain and superiority.
- the repetition of ""he'd think differently if he interpreted the bible the same way i do."" mimics and belittles the perceived simplicity of marc's argument.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
assign a sarcastic label to an input text.

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- **keywords and phrases**: phrases like ""bath houses and bars,"" ""studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say,"" and specific examples of how to make gay men ""look like"" certain things suggest a heavily critical tone.
- **surface emotion**: frustration and cynicism.

#### step 2: true intention
- **rhetorical devices**: the author uses hyperbolic examples and rhetorical questions (""and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars?"") to highlight perceived flaws in the methodology of studies on gay men.
- **language style**: the language is sarcastic because it mocks the reliability of studies by suggesting they are biased and shaped to meet the desires of funders.
- **true emotion**: skepticism and disdain towards the credibility of certain studies.

#### step 3: compare and analysis
- the surface sentiment shows cynicism and frustration.
- the true intention is to criticize the perceived bias in studies about gay men.
- the use of exaggerated examples and rhetorical questions suggests the speaker does not believe the studies are conducted impartially and is using sarcasm to criticize this.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the text uses sarcasm to convey deep criticism of the perceived validity and impartiality of studies on gay men. the exaggerated scenarios and dismissive tone indicate the author is not being sincere but is instead mocking the current state of research methodology.",1

**example input:**
""is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? is sarah palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?""

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.
- **keywords**: ""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the use of complex and somewhat mocking language suggests a negative sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, implying that the author does not genuinely seek answers but rather implies a critique.
- **language style**: the exaggerated language (""symbolic potent phallic aspect,"" ""manly sort"") suggests a tone of mockery and disdain, specifically targeted towards sarah palin’s actions.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the idea that shooting a wolf from a helicopter, something sarah palin did, could be seen as 'manly' or tied to masculinity. it satirizes this portrayal through exaggeration.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment suggests mockery and incredulity, while the true intention confirms a critical stance through rhetorical questions and exaggerated phrasing.
- **inference**: the disparity between the exaggerated, mocking tone at the surface and the underlying critical intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
- **final label:** sarcastic

given the mock-serious tone, rhetorical questioning, and exaggeration of certain aspects to critique sarah palin’s actions, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

        Step 3: Compare and analysis Step 1 and Step 2, infer the final sarcasm label.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: the phrase ""i love babies, they're delicious!"" outwardly appears to express love for babies but uses a shocking and inappropriate twist.
- **keywords**: ""love babies,"" ""delicious.""
- **sentimental phrases**: while ""love babies"" suggests positive sentiment, ""delicious"" used in this context is highly inappropriate and unlikely to be genuine, indicating a negative, mocking tone.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""they're delicious!"" is an example of hyperbole and dark humor, suggesting that the speaker is not serious about loving babies in a literal sense but rather criticizing or mocking the situation or person being addressed (""sleazyrider"").
- **language style**: the use of shock value and dark humor aims to ridicule or make a sarcastic comment.
- **intended meaning**: the speaker is not literally expressing a love for eating babies but is using a shocking statement to mock or criticize in a sarcastic manner.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the surface sentiment appears positive initially but quickly reveals a mocking intention. the true intention, evidenced by the use of deliberate shock value, confirms a sarcastic tone.
- **inference**: the disparity between the outwardly positive sentiment and the exaggerated, inappropriate statement supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**: the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate, given the use of dark humor and hyperbolic language to critique or mock.",1
"Hit that one right on the head, Symbiote. I'd like to hear supersport's response to this.",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","let's analyze the given sentence step by step to determine the sarcasm label.

### input:
""hit that one right on the head, symbiote. i'd like to hear supersport's response to this.""

### step 1: surface sentiment

- **keywords:** ""hit that one right on the head,"" ""i'd like to hear.""
- **sentimental phrases:**
  - ""hit that one right on the head"" generally means acknowledging that someone made a correct or insightful point.
  - ""i'd like to hear supersport's response to this"" seems like an expression of curiosity or anticipation.
- the surface sentiment appears to be positive and encouraging towards symbiote's comment, while also showing interest in supersport's response.

### step 2: true intention

- **rhetorical devices:** 
  - the phrase ""hit that one right on the head"" could be sarcastic, implying the opposite of making a valid point.
  - ""i'd like to hear supersport's response to this"" could imply skepticism about what supersport will say.
- **language style:**
  - the phraseology can often be used sarcastically, particularly in contentious or confrontational discussions.

### step 3: comparison and analysis

- the surface sentiment seems positive, indicating agreement and curiosity.
- the true intention might be sarcastic, especially if the context involves a debate where ""hit that one right on the head"" could be mocking the point as being painfully off-target.
- the interest in supersport's response could be genuine but might also suggest a setup for further criticism.

### conclusion
given the likely context (a potentially contentious discussion) and the potential for both phrases to be sarcastic, the true intention contrasts notably with the surface sentiment. the interest in supersport's response leans toward expecting something predictably disagreeable or evidential of further debate.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.

- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: ""you know, from the title, i was sure this would be about the hitchhikers guede to the galaxy' bible fish...""
- **surface emotion**: disappointment or letdown.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""i was sure"" followed by an ellipsis suggests that what follows will contradict the initial expectation, hinting at an ironic or sarcastic statement.
- **language style**: casual, anticipatory tone with a twist that the content diverges from the established expectation.
- **true emotion**: the speaker expresses a mild form of letdown mockingly.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment of disappointment and the structure of the sentence indicate a mismatch between expectation and reality.
- this mismatch, combined with the casual and mocking tone, shows that the speaker is using sarcasm to express their mild disappointment humorously.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the language used subtly mocks the mismatch between the title and the expected content, showing a form of mild sarcastic humor.",1

### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords: ""don't you see?,"" ""aren't sure,"" ""don't know,"" ""didn't 'prove' anything!!""
- sentimental phrases: the exclamations and the use of ""don't you see?"" suggest an exaggerated frustration or disbelief.
- the surface sentiment suggests mockery or frustration towards the notion that nothing has been proven.

**step 2: true intention:**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions (""but don't you see?"") and repetition emphasizes the perceived incompetence or uncertainty.
- language style: the emphatic ""didn't 'prove' anything!!"" with multiple exclamations strongly hints at a sarcastic tone.
- the speaker seems to sarcastically highlight the perceived failure or lack of certainty, implying that proof or certainty should be expected.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (frustration and mockery) contrasts with the literal statements (acknowledging uncertainty and lack of proof).
- this contrast highlights sarcasm, as the true intention is to criticize or mock the notion that something has not been proven emphatically.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""president speaks in public"", ""hand out guns to the audience"", ""respond to any assassination attempt""
- **sentimental phrases:** the idea of handing out guns to the audience when the president speaks is highly charged and controversial, resulting in an absurd scenario.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the exaggerated suggestion of giving guns to an audience during a presidential speech is clearly hyperbolic and absurd. it sarcastically mocks the idea of increased gun availability or lax gun control.
- **language style:** the extreme nature of the statement implies that the speaker likely does not genuinely support the idea but is instead criticizing or mocking attitudes towards guns and security.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** the surface sentiment appears to be a serious and extreme solution to a security issue, but the true intention, revealed through hyperbole and irony, suggests it is meant to be mocking and not to be taken literally.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""poor negros"" (in quotes), ""wouldn't want"" (implies obviousness or hyperbole).
- sentimental phrases: the phrase ""poor negros"" is used in a quotation, which implies that the speaker is mocking the notion rather than expressing genuine concern.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: the use of quotes around ""poor negros"" indicates sarcasm as it belittles and mocks the perspective of not wanting certain groups to reproduce.
- language style: the statement uses a patronizing tone and hyperbolic language (""wouldn't want those 'poor negros' reproducing"") to criticize the idea rather than endorse it.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment, which contains a seeming concern for social eugenics implications, contrasts sharply with the true intention of mocking and criticizing that very perspective.
- this discrepancy showcases a sarcastic tone by pretending to express a concern that is actually a criticism.

### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

#### reasoning process:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase ""so what are you trying to do here"" appears as a direct question.
   - the term ""smother everyone with bafflegab"" uses a somewhat unusual and complex term ""bafflegab,"" which means confusing or meaningless talk.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the use of ""bafflegab"" suggests the speaker finds the situation deeply confusing or overly complicated.
   - the phrase implies criticism rather than a genuine inquiry, making it sound like a rhetorical question meant to mock or chastise rather than seek information.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the disparity between the direct question format and the underlying criticism reveals a sarcastic tone. the rhetorical question serves to mock the complexity of the situation, not to seek genuine clarification.
   - the use of sarcasm is indicated by the exaggerated language and the rhetorical question's mocking nature.

by comparing the surface sentiment of the direct question with the underlying mockery indicated by the term ""bafflegab,"" it is evident that the statement is sarcastic.",1

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- phrases like ""perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again"" and ""after all, white folks are the only humans with white skin"" employ exaggeration and irony.
- the tone throughout the paragraph contains a mocking underlying sentiment, questioning the logic of the other person's argument through extreme examples.
- keywords indicating sarcasm and mockery: ""right?"" at the end of exaggerated statements suggests the author doesn't actually believe what they are saying.

#### step 2: true intention
- the use of extreme examples (such as restricting rights only to white folks) is not intended to be a serious proposition but to highlight the absurdity of the opposing argument.
- the rhetorical style suggests the author disagrees vehemently with the opponent's stance and uses sarcasm to undermine it.
- the true intention is to mock the idea that specific criteria should define who deserves rights, using hyperbole to show the ridiculousness of such beliefs.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the negative and critical tone on the surface sentiment aligns with the underlying purpose of mocking and questioning the other person's views through exaggerated and ironic statements.
- the consistency in tone and rhetorical style solidifies the classification as sarcastic, as the purpose is to ridicule and not genuinely argue the exaggerated points.

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase ""oh, ok then."" could indicate a neutral or accepting tone on the surface. there are no strong keywords or emotional phrases that obviously suggest extreme positivity or negativity. 

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the phrase ""oh, ok then."" can be used in various contexts. without additional vocal cues or context, the statement by itself seems neutral. however, in many cases, this phrase can be used sarcastically to express resignation or frustration when something is not satisfactory. it can often imply that the speaker is actually not okay with something but is pretending to agree or accept it.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - on the surface, the sentiment looks neutral and accepting. the true intention, however, may indicate a deeper level of irony or sarcasm because the tone implies resignation or frustrated acceptance rather than genuine agreement.
   - the contrast between the surface neutrality and the potential underlying frustration suggests that the statement could be sarcastic.

- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### conclusion:
given the rhetorical style, mocking tone, and insincere elements, the input example is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"".

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""easier path,"" ""stealing's easier than working,"" ""lying's easier than telling the truth,"" ""being a deadbeat parent is easier than being a good parent.""
- sentimental phrases: none are overtly sentimental, but the tone is quite critical.
- overall, the tone appears to be making broad generalizations about immoral behaviors versus moral behaviors.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the repetitive structure ""x is easier than y,"" with negative behaviors being positioned as ""easier,"" suggests an ironic comparison rather than a direct endorsement of immoral actions.
- language style: the list format and the phrase ""the list goes on and on"" adds to the impression that these ""easier"" choices are being criticized rather than promoted.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: the surface sentiment appears to present a negative view of the ease of immoral actions without explicitly criticizing these actions. however, the true intention is to highlight the societal problem and implicitly criticize these behaviors through ironic listing.
- inference: the repetitive and exaggerated nature of the examples serves a critical and mocking tone toward the subject matter, thus conveying sarcasm.

### conclusion:
the input text is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"" due to the use of rhetorical structure and an ironic tone that criticizes immoral behaviors.",1

Here are some examples.
### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### step-by-step analysis:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the phrase ""as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training?"" implies a scenario that is generally considered negative or dangerous.
- the follow-up ""not a good option"" clearly states a negative opinion about the imagined scenario.
- the sentence ""my apology if that was a failed sarcasm"" indicates that the speaker is acknowledging their attempt at sarcasm, which might have been unclear.

#### step 2: true intention
- the scenario described in the first part suggests a problematic situation where firearms can be acquired easily without proper checks.
- the true intention appears to be criticizing the ease of obtaining firearms, and the phrase ""my apology if that was a failed sarcasm"" confirms that the preceding statement was meant to be sarcastic.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (explicitly negative stance on the ease of purchasing firearms) aligns with the true intention of criticizing this practice.
- the acknowledgment of a possibly ""failed sarcasm"" reinforces the intended sarcastic nature, even if the speaker doubts its clarity.

### conclusion: 
the alignment between the explicit negative opinion and the confirmed attempt at sarcasm reveals the statement's sarcastic nature.

### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- **keywords and phrases:** ""open minded church that doesn't hate?"" ""gasp!"" ""many interpretations,"" ""differing denominations,"" ""closes binded right wing bigots.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the term ""open minded church that doesn't hate"" and ""gasp!"" use a mocking tone. describing differences in denominations while mentioning ""closes binded right wing bigots"" implies criticism towards certain interpretations and groups.

**step 2: true intention:**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of exclamation and the word ""gasp!"" indicates a performative surprise that hints at insincerity. the term ""closes binded right wing bigots"" is loaded with negative connotation. 
- **language style:** the statement contrasts the phrases ""open minded church"" and ""closes binded right wing bigots,"" indicating that the author does not genuinely believe in the simple contrast they've set up. 
- the statement seems to ridicule the idea that various denominations can coexist peacefully if they don't align with a particular stringent interpretation.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment of feigned surprise and criticism contrasts with what the sentence seems to discuss about open-mindedness and a variety of interpretations.
- the exaggerated performance of shock (""gasp!"") and the critical tone towards certain groups indicate that the statement's true intention is not straightforward praise or critique but a sarcastic dismissal of the idea that certain groups are open-minded and free of hate.

**conclusion:**
- the sentence uses sarcasm to criticize specific interpretations and convey the author's disdain for what they perceive as close-minded interpretations of the bible. the mock surprise and critical language style point towards a sarcastic intention.

oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

- **surface emotion**: skepticism, mockery, and condescension

**step 2: true intention**

### Example:
### context:
you are tasked with assigning a sarcasm label to a given text by refining your reasoning process.

### example input:
""this topic was discussed in another thread. kelvin said that-'if it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking japanese if you live on the westcoast, german if you live on the eastcoast.' urban legend. it should be illegal for women to have sex.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **language style**: the explanation that follows seems overly detailed and pedantic, which can be a way to mock someone's lack of understanding while pretending to offer a genuine explanation.
- **true emotion**: the speaker's true intention is likely to express disdain or critique the person's lack of scientific knowledge.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of irritation or frustration.
- the true intention, revealed through the dismissive language and detailed explanation, indicates that the speaker is mocking the other person's perceived ignorance.

### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

**final sarcasm label:**

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**
- keywords: ""want you to stop posting,"" ""rants,"" ""don't want their rants challenged,"" ""typical of the whole evolutionary community.""
- sentimental phrases: the terms ""don't want their rants challenged"" and ""typical of the whole evolutionary community"" suggest a critical and negative sentiment towards the evolutionary community.
- the surface sentiment appears to criticize the evolutionary community for not welcoming challenges to their views and being generally rant-prone.

**step 2: true intention:**
- rhetorical devices: the phrasing ""they want you to stop posting"" and ""typical of the whole evolutionary community"" seems to carry a tone of ridicule.
- language style: the use of ""i'm afraid"" can be seen as insincere, adding a layer of sarcasm.
- the statement criticizes the evolutionary community by implying that they are unable to handle opposing viewpoints, using a sarcastic tone to suggest this criticism.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (mocking and criticizing the evolutionary community) aligns with the true intention of ridiculing them for not wanting their views challenged.
- this alignment of mockery and the rhetorical criticism indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**
the input sentence uses sarcasm to criticize the evolutionary community for their supposed reluctance to accept challenges to their views. the mocking tone and the generalization about the entire community demonstrate clear sarcasm.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic, given the rhetorical device used and the mismatch between surface and true sentiment.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""if they exist in the mind and not on their own,"" ""i can choose not to think about or believe in these laws,"" ""come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept,"" ""if it existed only in the mind, it would not be absolute.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be dismissive and somewhat incredulous, with a playful tone regarding the dismissal of logical laws.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the exaggerated and rhetorical nature of the statements (e.g., ""come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either"") suggests a mocking attitude towards the idea that logical laws are subjective or can be dismissed merely by ignoring them.
- the phrasing and the exaggerated examples highlight the absurdity of the argument in a sarcastic manner.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (dismissive/incredulous) and the true intention (mockery of the idea that one can choose to believe in or not believe in logical laws) are aligned in a manner that suggests sarcasm.
- the mismatch between the logical structure of the argument and the absurd conclusion drawn reinforces the sarcastic tone.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
assign a sarcastic label to an input text.

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

- the rhetorical device and condescending tone demonstrate that the speaker doesn't genuinely believe the other person lacks understanding but wants to mock or criticize them—indicating sarcasm.

### conclusion
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the condescending rhetorical question aims to mock the other person’s understanding in a sarcastic manner.

"So you're saying that God is a ""respector""?-of-persons - iow, the mom's ""more""-important to *God*? than the unborn.",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: critical and incredulous tone.

the input text ""apes are sentient...guess your theory is out the window. either that or apes need to be freed from the zoo."" conveys a sarcastic tone. here's the reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues:** mocking and dismissive tone.
- **keywords:** ""guess your theory is out the window,"" ""either that or.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase ""your theory is out the window"" suggests a dismissive stance.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the statement starts with a supposed fact (""apes are sentient"") and follows with a dismissive conclusion that undermines the original theory. the phrase ""either that or apes need to be freed from the zoo"" further exaggerates the sentiment to an absurd level.
- **language style:** the exaggerated and mocking language indicates that the speaker does not genuinely believe in the literal meaning but is ridiculing the opposite viewpoint.
- **intended meaning:** the author is likely mocking the idea that apes are not sentient and criticizing the opposing theory by presenting an exaggerated alternative.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**

"I think what he meant to say was, ""I can see Finland from my basement.""",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**
- rhetorical devices: the statement uses exaggeration and absurdity (""i can see finland from my basement""), which is not possible.
- language style: the phrase ""i think what he meant to say was"" suggests a reinterpretation of someone's words and sets up the expectation for a humorous or mocking remark.
- true intention: the speaker is likely mocking someone for saying something equally outlandish or absurd, indicating a sarcastic remark.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **sentiment clues**: the tone appears incredulous and mocking.
- **keywords**: ""intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher,"" ""trivial matter like an unfavorable grade,"" ""just be easier,"" ""emotionally disturbed student,"" ""illegally bring a gun to school.""
- **sentimental phrases**: the mocking use of overly elaborate requirements for legally obtaining a gun (e.g., ""undergo fingerprinting,"" ""pay hundreds of dollars,"" ""attend an eight-hour course"") suggests a negative and ironic sentiment.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the questions posed are rhetorical, heavily implying that the author does not truly believe someone would go through all those legal hoops just to murder a teacher over a grade. instead, they point out the absurdity of this notion.
- **language style**: the exaggeration of the legal process contrasts with the ""trivial matter"" and suggests a tone of ridicule. the mention of an ""emotionally disturbed student"" bringing a gun illegally also implies the author finds the legal process moot in preventing such incidents.
- **intended meaning**: the author is likely criticizing the complexity and perceived ineffectiveness of the legal process for obtaining a gun in the context of preventing school shootings. they imply it's far more likely that someone intent on violence would bypass the legal process entirely.

**step 3: comparative analysis and inference**
- **comparison**: the incredulous and mocking tone at the surface aligns with the underlying critique of the legal process for obtaining a gun. the exaggeration and rhetorical style point towards a sarcastic intent.
- **inference**: the disparity between the surface sentiment and the final true intention clearly supports the label of sarcasm.

**conclusion**
the exaggerated, mocking tone and rhetorical questioning used to critique the legal process for obtaining a gun, as well as the scenario posed, indicate that the statement is sarcastic. thus, the appropriate label is ""sarcastic.""",1
How the hell can you narrow it down to three? The competition in the entire top ten is fierce.,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

**final sarcasm label:**

- sentimental phrases: ""how the hell"" suggests frustration or disbelief.
- the surface sentiment indicates surprise or disbelief at the idea of narrowing down choices to three in a highly competitive environment.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""how the hell can you narrow it down to three?"" suggests exaggeration, indicating that the task is impossible or highly unreasonable.
- language style: the use of informal and emphatic language, such as ""how the hell,"" indicates a strong reaction.
- the statement seems to imply that it's absurd or impossible to narrow the choices to three because of the high level of competition.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (expressing frustration or disbelief) contrasts with the actual implication (it's absurd to narrow down choices to three).
- this contrast between apparent disbelief and the implication of it being unreasonable points to a sarcastic tone.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of narrowing down choices to three amid fierce competition. the exaggerated expression of disbelief (""how the hell"") is a key indicator of sarcasm.",1

- **sentiment clues**: mocking and critical tone.
- **keywords**: ""complete inability,"" ""blimp pilots,"" ""better sexual success,"" ""sad sack.""
- **sentimental phrases**: phrases like ""complete inability"" and ""sad sack"" suggest a strong negative sentiment, bordering on ridicule.

### Example:

assign a sarcastic label to an input text.

### example input:
oh free market???? im goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **keywords and phrases**: words like ""oh free market????"" and the excessive exclamation points suggest heightened emotional expression.
- **surface emotion**: outrage or extreme excitement.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion of using “embryos and fetuses” as a “new food source” is so extreme and morally outrageous that it’s unlikely to be sincere.
- **language style**: over-the-top and provocative language used to criticize or mock the concept of a free market by highlighting a hyperbolic and unethical scenario.
- **true emotion**: deep criticism or disdain towards the idea being mocked—the free market.

**step 3: compare and analysis**
- the surface sentiment is one of extreme excitement or outrage.
- the true intention, deduced through hyperbolic and morally questionable suggestions, reveals a critical stance towards the free market.
- the disparity between the extreme surface sentiment and the evident criticism indicates the speaker is not serious but sarcastic.

### conclusion:
the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate because the exaggerated scenario and emotional tone are used to mock or criticize a concept, revealing true disdain hidden beneath exaggerated enthusiasm.

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- **clues such as keywords:** ""urban legend"", ""it should be illegal for women to have sex.""
- **sentimental phrases:** the phrase suggests an absurd extreme (making it illegal for women to have sex) which is a hyperbole often used in sarcasm.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** the use of ""urban legend"" indicates skepticism towards the statement about gun ownership and wwii.
- **language style:** the claim about making it illegal for women to have sex is so outrageous that it's likely not a serious suggestion, but rather a sarcastic comment intended to highlight the absurdity.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment might seem serious or extreme, the underlying use of hyperbole and irony indicates it is not meant to be taken literally.
  
**conclusion:**
- the surface absurdity of the statement and the rhetorical devices employed strongly suggest sarcasm. thus, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

- **sentimental phrases:** the expression ""oh please dont give me that"" suggests disbelief or a dismissive attitude. the statement ""its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement"" is phrased in a way that suggests irony, particularly because it contrasts with the idea that someone is at fault. the questioning of the value of implementing gay marriage and the rhetorical style indicates strong opposition, but phrased in a way that suggests mockery.

**step 2: true intention**
- **rhetorical devices:** use of phrases like ""oh please"" and exaggerated claims about the world ceasing to exist indicates a mocking tone. the historical argument against gay marriage (""the world has lived without gay marriage its whole existence.... so why implement it now??"") is also intended to mock the push for such changes by underplaying the significance of progress or human rights.
- **language style:** the exaggerated and dismissive language (""oh please"", ""its so great that you can try"", ""world would cease"") suggests a sarcastic tone intended to undermine the opposing viewpoint.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- **surface vs. true meaning:** while the surface sentiment expresses a strong opposition to gay marriage, the mocking and exaggerated language used to present this viewpoint signals that it is not meant to be a literal, serious statement but rather an ironic or sarcastic comment intending to ridicule the idea of supporting gay marriage.

**conclusion:**
- based on the surface absurdity of the statements, the rhetorical style, and the mocking tone, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1

Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:** assign a sarcastic label to the example input.

**example input:**
well, both traffic in waste material. many traps are present in each for them to function properly. and don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.

**example label:** sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1:** **surface sentiment:**
- keywords and phrases: ""traffic in waste material,"" ""many traps,"" ""lead you--into a cesspool.""
- the surface sentiment appears to be a factual or cynical description, focusing on waste and cesspools.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the comparison of biological evolution and plumbing both leading to a ""cesspool"" suggests a rhetorical device, namely an ironic twist.
- the language style, particularly the unexpected punchline about a cesspool, indicates mockery or dark humor, emphasizing the absurdity of comparing such distinct processes.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (factual/cynical) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/irony).
- this contrast between a seemingly serious tone and an absurd punchline leads to the inference of sarcasm.

**conclusion:** the final sarcasm label is confirmed as sarcastic, given the rhetorical device used and the mismatch between surface and true sentiment.

Maryland already has the law on the books. It's effect thus far has only been to eliminate certain makes and models from the Maryland marketplace and to extinguish the sale of certain collectables.,1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
### context:
you have provided an example input and asked for a refined reasoning process to determine if the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.

### example input:
""again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. it can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. science can make no assertion as to what you saw. you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect. how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. actually, it's sad.""

### example label:
sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- initial phrases like ""again your failure"" start with a critical tone.
- phrases like ""whatever your apostle tells you,"" are mocking.
- the sentence ""you may think it is wonderful, but lsd had that effect"" trivializes the other person's perception.
- keywords indicating negativity and sarcasm: ""failure,"" ""lsd,"" ""it's sad.""

#### step 2: true intention
- the language is heavily loaded with sarcasm, using rhetorical questioning and mocking the other person's understanding and beliefs.
- the statement ""how strange that you think that your emotions are scientific"" ridicules the opposite viewpoint.
- the concluding ""actually, it's sad,"" adds a sarcastic tone indicating mock pity or disdain.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment contains sharp criticism and mockery.
- the true intention, revealed through rhetorical devices, confirms the presence of sarcasm.
- there is a stark contrast between the purportedly explanatory tone and the underlying mockery, confirming the use of sarcasm.

### conclusion:
by comparing the clues from the language used and understanding the true intention behind the statement, it is clear that the example is indeed sarcastic.

### brief response:
the given input employs a critical and mocking tone, using rhetorical devices to belittle and trivialize the other's viewpoint. this clear presence of sarcasm validates the label ""sarcastic"".

### label: not sarcastic

### reasoning process:

#### step 1: surface sentiment
- the text discusses the tangible outcomes of a law in maryland.
- phrases such as ""eliminate certain makes and models"" and ""extinguish the sale of certain collectables"" appear factual and descriptive.
- there is no immediate presence of emotionally charged or mocking language.

#### step 2: true intention
- the intention behind the statement appears to be informative or descriptive, focusing on the effects of a law.
- there are no rhetorical devices, exaggeration, or absurdity that would suggest the speaker is mocking or criticizing in a sarcastic manner.

#### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment is factual and neutral.
- analysis of the language style and intention indicates the speaker is providing information without a layer of mockery or implied criticism.
- since both the surface sentiment and true intention align with a straightforward conveyance of information, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0
"On the contrary, the wet dreams of those slavering over these appalling British figures miss the fact that bad as they are, those 3 or 4 more murders in the USA per hundred thousand population equates to your likelihood of being murdered there as at least ten times higher than in that dangerous place Britain.

Here are some examples.
### Example:
context: identifying if a statement is sarcastic or not based on its content.

example input: 
""hey, thanks for the quote! am i published now?""

example label: sarcastic

reasoning process:
1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase starts with ""hey, thanks for the quote!"" which suggests a positive and grateful tone.
   - the follow-up question, ""am i published now?"" sounds like a genuine inquiry about publication status.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - upon analyzing the context, the expression ""thanks for the quote"" coupled with the question ""am i published now?"" indicates potential irony. the speaker likely already knows the answer to their question and might be highlighting the trivial nature of their quote being published.
   - the use of a rhetorical question ""am i published now?"" implies that the speaker doesn't actually expect publication to be the outcome, suggesting frustration or mockery rather than genuine inquiry.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the discrepancy between the surface courtesy and the underlying skepticism or mockery reveals a sarcastic tone.
   - the surface sentiment indicates gratitude while the true intention shows irony. this contrast is a hallmark of sarcasm.

conclusion: 
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, it's clear that the statement is sarcastic. the apparent gratitude is contradicted by the rhetorical question that conveys an underlying sense of mockery or disbelief.

        ### Response:

        ### Label: 

        ","### label: sarcastic

### reasoning process:

1. **step 1: surface sentiment**
   - the phrase ""on the contrary"" suggests a rebuttal or disagreement.
   - phrases like ""wet dreams of those slavering over"" and ""suck on that"" have a derisive and confrontational tone, indicating disdain or mockery.

2. **step 2: true intention**
   - the expression ""wet dreams of those slavering over these appalling british figures"" implies that the speaker is mocking individuals who are overly fixated on criticizing british crime statistics.
   - the statement ""bad as they are"" acknowledges the poor statistics but is used to set up a comparison that favors the uk's situation.
   - the comparison of murder rates aims to emphasize that the situation in the usa is far worse, thus criticizing the misplaced focus.
   - the phrase ""suck on that"" is a colloquial way of telling someone to accept an unpleasant truth, reinforcing a tone of mockery and disdain.

3. **step 3: comparison and analysis**
   - the surface sentiment is harsh and confrontational.
   - the true intention is to mock and belittle those obsessing over british crime statistics by highlighting the more severe situation in the usa.
   - the discrepancy between the initial appearance of addressing the statistics seriously and the underlying intent to ridicule highlights sarcasm.

conclusion:
by comparing the surface sentiment and the true intention, the statement is clearly sarcastic. the confrontational and mocking language used serves to emphasize the irony and disdain.",1
"So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

assigning a sarcasm label to a given input based on surface sentiment and true intention.

**example input:**

""and in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of genesis. of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.""

**example label:**

sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

**step 1: surface sentiment:**

- keywords: ""haven't been able to,"" ""falsify,"" ""debunk,"" ""deluded minds.""
- sentimental phrases: the term ""deluded minds"" suggests a negative sentiment towards the evolutionists.
- the surface sentiment seems to mock or criticize the efforts of evolutionists.

**step 2: true intention:**

- rhetorical devices: use of hyperbole in ""all the evolutionists in the world"" and ""150 years.""
- language style: the use of ""of course"" implies an obviousness that may not be sincere.
- the statement seems to dismiss the efforts of evolutionists sarcastically, suggesting that their belief in debunking genesis is without merit and delusional.

**step 3: comparison and analysis:**

- the surface sentiment (mocking evolutionists) contrasts with what the statement pretends to convey (that genesis has not been debunked despite attempts).
- this contrast between mocking evolutionists and the seemingly straightforward statement of genesis's resilience indicates sarcasm.

**conclusion:**

the input sentence uses a sarcastic tone to ridicule the belief of evolutionists. the mocking nature of ""deluded minds"" and the hyperbolic context clue us in that the statement's true intention is not to praise genesis's endurance but to sarcastically belittle the efforts of evolutionists.

        ### Label: 

        ","### step 1: surface sentiment

- sentimental phrases: the term ""brain damage"" is a highly negative phrase indicating severe criticism. ""not getting any better"" suggests incompetence or lack of improvement.
- the surface sentiment seems to criticize or belittle the addressed individual.

### step 2: true intention
- rhetorical devices: use of rhetorical questions ""so...all christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor?"" and ""you're not getting any better at this are you?"" both imply disbelief or mocking.
- language style: the ""so..."" at the start implies skepticism or challenge. the rhetorical questions are not seeking real answers but are designed to belittle or mock trebor.
- the statement seems to mock trebor's beliefs or statements by sarcastically implying that his views equate to calling all christians brain damaged, which is a facetious exaggeration to ridicule him.

### step 3: comparison and analysis
- the surface sentiment (negative, mocking trebor) aligns well with the true intention (sarcastically ridiculing trebor's competence and view).
- this alignment of mocking surface sentiment with a sarcastic true intention indicates a sarcastic tone.

- keywords and phrases: ""all forms of life?"" ""animal life?"" ""plant life?"" ""the mold growing in your bathroom?""
- the surface sentiment appears to be inquisitive, exploring different forms of life in a rhetorical manner.

**step 2:** **true intention:**
- the progressively trivial examples, climaxing with ""the mold growing in your bathroom?"" suggest an exaggerated comparison meant to trivialize the discussion.
- the absurdity of equating mold with broader categories of life implies a mocking or sardonic tone.

**step 3:** **comparison and analysis:**
- the surface sentiment (inquisitive/exploratory) contrasts with the true intention (mockery/sardonism).

refining the reasoning process for assigning a ""sarcastic"" label to an input example.

### example input:
""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said. how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen? besides that little piece about lacking awareness i don't really buy it. a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger? serious question, penfold, and i will even dispense with the comrade, are you a plant just to get people going? or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm? and if so, i apologize.""

### example label:

### reasoning process and conclusion:

**step 1: surface sentiment**
- keywords and phrases: ""lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" 
- sentimental phrases: ""i don't really buy it.""
- overall, the tone appears conflicted, with elements of skepticism and rhetorical questioning.

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the use of rhetorical questions like ""how is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?"" and ""a gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?"" suggests irony or sarcasm. these questions imply that the argument is not genuine.
- language style: the formal dressing down of the phrase ""lacked an awareness"" juxtaposed with casual dismissal ""i don't really buy it"" suggests a mocking tone.
- the final sentences with sharp questions directed at ""penfold"" with a sarcastic ""comrade"" and finally an insincere apology put focus on an underlying mockery.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: there is a clear discrepancy between the surface sentiment (seemingly serious concern) and the true intention (mocking, skeptical, dismissive).
- inference: the use of rhetorical questions and insincere language indicates an attempt to mock or criticize rather than genuinely inquire or debate.

### conclusion:
given the rhetorical style, mocking tone, and insincere elements, the input example is appropriately labeled as ""sarcastic"".

**step 2: true intention**
- rhetorical devices: the phrase ""experiment with the notion that you will be sexually attracted to your own sex"" suggests an absurd scenario, pointing towards irony. the follow-up ""come back and report your findings!"" further underscores the mockery.
- language style: the formal directive mixed with an absurd suggestion implies the speaker is not serious and is trying to be sarcastic.

**step 3: compare and analyze**
- analysis: the surface sentiment of giving an absurd ""experiment"" and requesting a report is incongruous with a genuine request. instead, it mocks the notion of the experiment itself.

And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.   So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?",1,"
Here are some examples.
### Example:
**context:**

the example input discusses the legality of carrying firearms in virginia and responds to a statistic about legal gun carriers who have ""killed"" people in three years. it challenges the statistic by comparing it to nationwide averages and suggests that gun carriers are actually safer than the regular population, while using a sarcastic tone to criticize the organization providing the statistic.

**example input:**
""no permit is required in virginia! you can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one. virginia performs an fbi background check and issues a permit upon request for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit. this statistic is just those who have requested one! imagine how many people who lawfully carry that have not requested one! i would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is way more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request. yet, in three years, people who lawfully carry a gun have ""killed"" 107 people? ooooooh! wow! so us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun ""killings""? (notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - there. that's how it looks: .01%. it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of ""killings"" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns. because it would show that ""killings"" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber ""killings"" by those who do by a huge margin. the vpc can't have that now, can they? when you show the entire statistic, it makes gun carriers look safer than the regular population. the horror! it would mean the vpc's point of view would be....uh....wrong!""

**example label:**
sarcastic

**reasoning process:**

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - the use of ""ooooooh! wow!"" and phrases like ""the horror!"" and ""uh....wrong!"" suggest an exaggerated reaction.
   - phrases such as ""it's obvious why they don't compare this statistic,"" ""because it would show,"" and ""the vpc can't have that now, can they?"" hint at mockery and disbelief.

2. **true intention:**
   - the exaggerated language and rhetorical questions indicate the author doesn’t genuinely believe that this is a shocking revelation or a crisis.
   - the author uses these rhetorical devices to mock the interpretation of the statistics, implying the statistics are used misleadingly to present gun carriers in a negative light.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - surface sentiment comes off as surprised and alarmed, but the true intention is to ridicule the initial claim.
   - the use of mock horror and sarcasm stems from a perceived unjust accusation against law-abiding gun carriers.

**conclusion:**
both the surface sentiment and true intention showcase a sarcastic tone, making the label ""sarcastic"" appropriate.

### reasoning process:

1. **surface sentiment:**
   - phrases like ""well, i think it is best to use a real source"" and ""to be fair, australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too"" suggest a seemingly respectful and admiring tone.
   - however, questioning ""then what is the point of mentioning that gun related crime went down?"" hints at a dismissive and skeptical attitude.

2. **true intention:**
   - the author discusses the violent crime rate and mentions the flat homicide rate in australia while implying the increase in non-gun related violent crimes negates the significance of the reduction in gun-related crimes.
   - the language style, including the rhetorical question at the end, indicates the author is undermining the importance of the statistic about gun-related crime going down.

3. **comparison and analysis:**
   - the seemingly respectful tone on the surface contrasts with the author's underlying skepticism and dismissal of the relevance of the provided statistics.
   - the use of rhetorical questions and subtle critique makes the text sarcastic.

thus, both the surface sentiment and the true intention support the conclusion that the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1
