no

while there's some uncertainty without more context, this single line of dialogue doesn't provide sufficient cues to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the statement could be straightforwardly answering a question, or it could potentially be sarcastic, but there's not enough information from this line alone to make that determination with confidence.

label:
sarcastic

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.","### response:

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

based on the cues provided, the statement by sheldon contains elements of humor and irony. the casual offer of epinephrine, which is typically used for serious allergic reactions, in the context of it not being bee season, suggests a nonchalant attitude towards a potentially serious situation. this use of irony and the unexpected nature of the statement indicate that the dialogue is likely sarcastic.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious contradictions or irony that would indicate sarcasm.
2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.
3. there's no detectable contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **rhetorical device**: the use of ""not to mention"" is an understatement, which is a common rhetorical device in sarcasm. it downplays the inconvenience of having to power down on saturdays, suggesting that it is a minor detail when it is actually significant.
2. **emotional contrast**: there is a subtle emotional contrast between the inconvenience implied by ""power down on saturdays"" and the casual way it is mentioned, which can indicate sarcasm.
3. **language style**: the informal and conversational style can often be a vehicle for sarcastic remarks.
4. **context**: the context of discussing a situation where someone would need to power down on saturdays implies a disruption to routine, which can be a source of frustration or annoyance, often expressed sarcastically.
5. **tone**: the tone, while not explicitly negative, carries an implied criticism or annoyance about the need to power down on saturdays.

given these cues, sheldon's statement appears to be sarcastic, downplaying the inconvenience in a way that suggests it is more significant than he is letting on.",1.0

while the provided cues offer some useful information about the text's structure, punctuation, and content, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. sarcasm often relies heavily on context, tone, and shared understanding between speakers, which may not be fully captured in these cues alone. the unusual nature of the statement (a famous actor living in a broom closet) could potentially indicate sarcasm, but it could also be part of a non-sarcastic comedic or absurdist dialogue. more context about the surrounding conversation, the speaker's typical manner of speech, or the broader situation would be needed to make a more confident judgment about sarcastic intent.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **rhetorical devices**: the text uses sarcasm and hyperbole. sheldon mocks the person's scientific abilities by comparing them to a chimp, which is an exaggerated and sarcastic way to belittle their contributions.
2. **mocking tone**: the phrase ""oh, please"" sets a dismissive and sarcastic tone, indicating that sheldon does not take the person's scientific abilities seriously.
3. **absurdity**: the idea of resuming the practice of sending chimps into space is an exaggerated and absurd statement, further emphasizing the sarcastic nature of the comment.
4. **context**: the context provided indicates that sheldon is using sarcasm to mock someone's scientific abilities, which aligns with the characteristics of a sarcastic statement.",1.0

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:
sheldon makes a humorous remark about including an inhaler when he publishes his work, suggesting a light-hearted and playful tone. the language style in the given text is informal and conversational. by suggesting that he might include an inhaler when he publishes his work, he humorously implies that his work is so groundbreaking or intense that readers might need help catching their breath.

5. **context**: the question ""what do you think i did?"" followed by the detailed and exaggerated response implies that the speaker is mocking the obviousness of their actions, a common sarcastic technique.

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious contradictions or irony that would indicate sarcasm.
2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.
3. there's no detectable contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **straightforward statement**: the statement is a simple recounting of a past event without any apparent irony or contradiction.
2. **anecdotal nature**: the use of an anecdote typically aims to share a personal experience rather than to convey sarcasm.
3. **lack of emotional contrast**: there is no significant emotional contrast or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.
4. **neutral tone**: the tone is neutral and factual, focusing on the act of receiving a gift rather than mocking or ridiculing it.
5. **punctuation and language style**: the punctuation and informal, conversational language style do not indicate sarcasm.

### explanation:
the text provided does not exhibit clear signs of sarcasm. instead, it appears to be a straightforward suggestion. here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **literal interpretation**: raj is offering a genuine alternative if the current options are not satisfactory. the suggestion to ""go next door and build her a bear"" is a practical and sincere solution.
2. **tone and context**: the tone is light-hearted and playful, but not mocking or condescending. the use of humor through wordplay (""build her a bear"") adds a fun element, but it does not imply sarcasm.
3. **emotional contrast**: the contrast between disliking the current situation and suggesting a positive alternative does not inherently indicate sarcasm. it simply shows a willingness to find a better option.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **content and context**: leonard's statement is straightforward and does not contain any absurd or highly unlikely claims. he is simply suggesting that he might have misheard something because many words sound like ""yoga.""
2. **tone and language style**: the tone is conversational and informal, indicating a genuine attempt to clarify a potential misunderstanding rather than to mock or convey sarcasm.
3. **rhetorical device**: the use of wordplay (pun) here is to add humor and lighten the conversation, not to convey sarcasm.
4. **emotional contrast**: leonard's expression of confusion or uncertainty suggests a genuine attempt to understand, rather than a sarcastic remark.

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

1. **rhetorical question**: leonard's use of a rhetorical question (""why don't i get a shot?"") suggests that he is not expecting an actual answer but is instead highlighting his frustration or sense of being overlooked. this is a common device used in sarcasm.
2. **emotional words**: phrases like ""excuse me"" and ""what about me?"" indicate a strong emotional response, often associated with feelings of exclusion or frustration, which can be expressed sarcastically.
3. **context of exclusion**: leonard feels left out and is seeking inclusion, which can lead to sarcastic remarks as a way to cope with or highlight his feelings.
4. **informal and conversational style**: the casual tone can often accompany sarcastic remarks, especially in informal settings where individuals feel comfortable expressing their true feelings indirectly.

given these cues, leonard's statement appears to be sarcastic, as he is likely using sarcasm to express his frustration about not being given an opportunity.",1.0

2. **emotional words**: the phrase ""all night"" suggests an exaggeration, which is a common feature of sarcasm. it implies that the situation is dragging on unnecessarily.
3. **context**: leonard is trying to persuade someone to join him and others, suggesting that the conversation or situation could continue indefinitely otherwise. this exaggeration can be seen as a sarcastic way to emphasize the futility of resisting.

the text shows a genuine emotional outburst with clear progression from shock to anger to a harsh judgment. the exclamations and the rapid shift in emotions indicate sincere, intense feelings rather than sarcastic undertones. the directness of the statements, especially the final accusation ""you are just a horrible person!"", suggests that rachel is expressing her true feelings without any irony or sarcasm.","### response:

the word ""terrific"" at the beginning of leonard's statement is a strong indicator of sarcasm. he describes the situation as ""terrific"" but immediately follows it with a concern that penny doesn't want him to go, which creates a contrast between the positive word and the negative situation. this contrast suggests that leonard is not genuinely enthusiastic but rather using sarcasm to express his disappointment or frustration.",1.0

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **absurdity and exaggeration**: the statement ""big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken"" is absurd and exaggerated, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm. it implies that the person being addressed is not as tough or brave as they are pretending to be.
2. **teasing tone**: the phrase ""big talk"" is often used sarcastically to mock someone who is boasting or making grand claims. it suggests that the speaker does not take the other person's words seriously.
3. **context of teasing**: the context provided indicates that raj is teasing someone about an embarrassing incident. teasing often involves sarcasm to highlight the contrast between the person's current behavior and a past, less impressive event.
4. **conversational style**: the informal and conversational style of the statement supports the sarcastic tone, as sarcasm is often used in casual, everyday interactions to make a point humorously.

2. **character context**: sheldon is known for his sarcastic and often condescending remarks, especially when discussing topics he considers beneath his intellectual level.
3. **contrast**: the contrast between the actual nature of waitressing and sheldon's description highlights the sarcastic tone. the over-the-top language used to describe a relatively simple job suggests that sheldon is not being sincere.
4. **language style**: the formal and analytical language used to describe a mundane job is a common technique in sarcasm, where the speaker intentionally uses inappropriate language to mock or belittle the subject.

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### response:

### reasoning:
1. **absurdity and hyperbole**: howard's statement contains an exaggerated and absurd claim that the person will only have a new girlfriend when he figures out how to build one. this hyperbole is a clear indicator of sarcasm.
2. **contrast**: the contrast between the ease with which the woman will find a new boyfriend and the impossibility of the man finding a new girlfriend (unless he builds one) highlights the sarcastic tone.
3. **humor**: the statement is intended to be humorous, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
4. **context**: the context of the statement suggests a humorous and sarcastic commentary on the difficulties of finding a new partner after a breakup.

based on these points, the statement by howard is clearly sarcastic.",1.0

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

while there is some uncertainty, the cues provided offer strong indications of emotional contrasts and extreme reactions that are often associated with sarcasm. the rapid shift from excitement to anger and harsh judgment, along with the exaggerated language, suggests a potentially sarcastic tone. however, it's important to note that context beyond these cues would provide even greater certainty in determining sarcastic polarity.

sarcastic

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:

the given text contains the following punctuation marks:
- a colon (:)
- a comma (,)
- a period (.)

in the given text, howard is expressing an understanding of someone's point of view but asserts that, when given a choice, jewish people typically prefer chinese food.

the emotional contrast in the text is between understanding and preference. howard acknowledges the other person's point (understanding) but emphasizes a strong cultural preference for chinese food among jews (preference).

the topic of the text is about a preference among jews for chinese food.

the language style in the given text is conversational and informal.

in the given text, howard uses a rhetorical device known as ""hyperbole"" to emphasize a cultural preference by making a broad, exaggerated statement. he suggests that jews always choose chinese food, which is an overstatement meant to humorously highlight a common stereotype.

the provided cues offer valuable context and analysis, but they are not entirely sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while the rhetorical device of hyperbole is identified, which can be associated with sarcasm, the overall tone and intent remain somewhat ambiguous without additional context or delivery cues (like tone of voice or facial expressions). the statement could be interpreted as a genuine, if humorously exaggerated, apology or as a sarcastic comment, depending on the broader context and delivery. therefore, more information would be needed to confidently determine sarcastic polarity.

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### response:

1. **humor and absurdity**: penny's statement about studying humans and reporting to alien overlords is clearly absurd and humorous, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.

3. **underlying distrust**: the statement implies a mix of light-heartedness and underlying suspicion, which is often conveyed through sarcasm.
4. **context**: given the context of a sitcom or comedy show, such statements are typically meant to be taken sarcastically rather than literally.

1. **emotional contrast**: the brief emotional contrast in the text is between curiosity and a hint of sarcasm or teasing. penny's question about a new girlfriend suggests curiosity, while the follow-up comment ""you might need one"" implies a teasing or sarcastic tone.
2. **context**: the context of asking about a new girlfriend and then suggesting that the person might need one indicates a sarcastic jab, implying that the person currently does not have a girlfriend and might be in need of one.
3. **language style**: the conversational and informal style, along with the playful nature of the comment, supports the interpretation of sarcasm.

the text shows howard questioning someone's plan with a tone that suggests disbelief or incredulity. the phrasing ""so what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"" implies that howard finds the plan either impractical or absurd, which is a common indicator of sarcasm. the use of ""so what"" at the beginning of the sentence further emphasizes a dismissive or mocking attitude, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and descriptive, using simple adjectives ""old"" and ""dingy"" to describe something.
2. there's no apparent contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typical in sarcasm.
3. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than exaggerated or mocking, which are common in sarcastic statements.
4. the phrase ""that's all"" suggests a simple, direct conclusion rather than any hidden meaning.
5. the informal, conversational style is consistent with genuine speech rather than sarcastic intent.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, in this case, joey's statement appears to be a sincere description without any indicators of sarcastic undertones.","### response:

1. **polite and considerate language**: the statement uses polite language (""that's very thoughtful"") which is typically not associated with sarcasm.
2. **clear preference**: the speaker clearly states their preference to finish their coffee first, which is a straightforward and sincere expression.
3. **lack of exaggeration or mocking tone**: there is no exaggeration or mocking tone in the statement, which are common indicators of sarcasm.
4. **contextual clarity**: the context suggests a genuine response to a considerate offer or suggestion, indicating a sincere intent rather than a sarcastic one.

chandler's statement exhibits classic elements of sarcasm, particularly his deadpan delivery contrasting others' potential amusement with his own affected indifference. the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is a clear example of dry humor, understating his reaction in a way that actually emphasizes the amusing nature of whatever is being discussed. this kind of sardonic comment is very characteristic of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic wit.","### response:

sheldon's statement about albert einstein's ""fondest hope"" for the laser being ""bitchin'"" is a clear example of sarcasm. the use of the informal and slang term ""bitchin'"" in the context of a highly scientific and historical discussion is deliberately incongruous and humorous, which is a hallmark of sarcastic speech. this kind of humor is characteristic of sheldon's character in ""the big bang theory,"" known for his intellectual yet socially awkward and often sarcastic remarks.",1.0

1. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism.
2. the rhetorical question ""and what would my opening line be?"" suggests chandler is mocking the idea.
3. the abrupt ""excuse me"" at the end appears to be chandler sarcastically imagining a weak opening line, further emphasizing his skepticism about the suggestion.

given chandler's character (likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor), and the context provided in the cues, this response is definitely sarcastic in nature.","### response:

the input text does not show clear signs of sarcasm. here’s the analysis:

1. **context**: leonard is discussing a research topic that many people are working on and then asks for clarification about something else. this context does not inherently suggest sarcasm.
2. **language style**: the language style is conversational and informal, which is typical for a discussion about research but does not indicate sarcasm.
3. **rhetorical devices**: 
   - **hyperbole**: ""a lot of people"" could be seen as an exaggeration, but it is not necessarily sarcastic.
   - **rhetorical question**: ""so what is all this?"" is a question asked for effect, but it does not imply sarcasm on its own.
4. **emotional words**: the text does not contain any explicit emotional words that would suggest sarcasm.
5. **punctuation**: the punctuation used (colon, period, question mark) is standard and does not indicate sarcasm.

given the cues and the analysis, the text appears to be a straightforward inquiry rather than a sarcastic remark.

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
the statement ""well, i'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper."" can be interpreted as sarcastic due to several cues:

1. **keywords and phrasing**: the use of ""finally"" implies that the speaker may have had doubts or frustrations about the person's previous choices, which can be a setup for sarcasm.
2. **emotional contrast**: the contrast between ""glad"" and ""finally"" suggests a possible underlying dissatisfaction or impatience, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
3. **colloquialism**: the phrase ""found yourself a keeper"" is informal and can be used sarcastically to imply that the speaker is not genuinely impressed.
4. **contextual implication**: without additional context, the statement can be read as a backhanded compliment, which is a common form of sarcasm.

sarcastic

the line from chandler exhibits classic sarcastic humor, using an absurd, exaggerated scenario (spanish midgets wrestling julie) to comedically comment on a situation. the follow-up ""okay yes i see how they got there"" is a clear use of deadpan sarcasm, pretending to understand a ridiculous leap in conversation or events. this type of humor is very characteristic of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic quips and witty remarks.","### response:

1. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism.
2. the rhetorical question ""and what would my opening line be?"" suggests chandler is mocking the idea.

while punctuation can sometimes provide hints about tone, the given punctuation information alone is not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this text. sarcasm often relies on context, word choice, and knowledge of the situation being discussed, which are not captured by simple punctuation analysis. more comprehensive linguistic and contextual cues would be needed to accurately identify sarcastic intent.

while the provided cues offer some useful information about the text's structure, punctuation, and content, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. sarcasm often relies heavily on context, tone, and shared understanding between speakers, which are not fully captured in these cues. the absurdist nature of the statement (a famous actor living in a broom closet) could potentially indicate sarcasm, but it could also be part of a nonsensical joke or a misunderstanding within the context of a larger conversation. without more information about the broader context, the speaker's typical manner of speech, or the recipient's reaction, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether this statement is meant to be sarcastic.

next_cue_response:common knowledge

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrast**: the statement ""yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?"" can be interpreted as having an emotional contrast between the surface-level optimism and an underlying negative sentiment. this contrast is a common indicator of sarcasm.
2. **rhetorical device**: the use of irony in the statement suggests that penny is implying the opposite of what is being said, indicating that the current situation is not actually great.
3. **contextual clues**: the informal and conversational tone, combined with the use of a rhetorical question, further supports the interpretation of sarcasm.
4. **common knowledge**: given the context, it is likely that penny is responding to a situation that is not actually positive, making her statement sarcastic.

based on these cues, it is reasonable to label the text as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

while i'm not 100% certain, i'm about 70% confident that these punctuation cues alone are not sufficient to detect sarcasm in this text. the punctuation mainly indicates pauses and hesitation, which could be present in both sincere and sarcastic speech. without additional context, tone indicators, or content analysis, it's difficult to determine sarcasm based solely on these punctuation cues.

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward, albeit hesitant, admission from ross about the existence of ""someone else"" in a likely romantic context. the hesitation, repetition, and nervous language (""umm"", ""there's-there's"") indicate genuine discomfort and seriousness, which is inconsistent with sarcasm. the content and delivery suggest this is a sincere, potentially relationship-altering confession, rather than a sarcastic remark.","### label:

1. **emotional contrast**: the text indicates an emotional contrast between surprise and disbelief, which is a common marker of sarcasm.
2. **questioning tone**: the use of a questioning tone, especially with the phrase ""i'm sorry,"" suggests that the speaker finds the situation hard to believe, which can imply sarcasm.
3. **context**: the context provided (sheldon buying a loom and learning to weave) is unusual and unexpected, which can lead to a sarcastic response.
4. **informal and conversational style**: the informal and conversational style, combined with the specific actions mentioned, adds to the likelihood that the speaker is being sarcastic.

3. the hesitation in speech (""we- we"") implies sincerity and potentially emotional vulnerability.
4. the context suggests this is part of a personal narrative or conversation, where ross is likely sharing information about his relationship honestly.
5. there are no contradictory elements or unexpected twists that might indicate sarcastic intent.

3. **context**: bernadette is likely trying to make the person feel better about themselves, which suggests sincerity.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
the text provided by howard contains cues that suggest sarcasm. the phrase ""here's some other fun news"" is an understatement, as giving diamond earrings and leasing a car are significant and extravagant gestures. the use of the word ""fun"" downplays the seriousness of these actions, which is a common technique in sarcasm. additionally, the informal and conversational tone, combined with the rhetorical device of understatement, indicates that howard might be using sarcasm to comment on the extravagance of raj's actions. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate for this text.",1.0

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:
howard's remark is clearly sarcastic. the statement ""whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you"" is meant to highlight the absurdity of whispering in the presence of someone who is deaf, as whispering would be ineffective. the use of the word ""smart"" at the beginning of the sentence further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, as it is likely meant to be taken ironically.

### reasoning:
1. **contradiction/irony**: the phrase ""mighty white of you"" is an outdated and often sarcastic expression implying that someone is being condescending or patronizing.
2. **context**: leonard's statement ""i'll make you a list"" followed by ""oh, that would be mighty white of you"" suggests a sarcastic tone, as it implies that making a list is a trivial or unnecessary task.
3. **language style**: the use of the phrase ""mighty white of you"" is typically sarcastic in modern usage, indicating that the speaker does not genuinely appreciate the offer.
4. **tone**: the tone of the statement is dismissive and mocking, which are common indicators of sarcasm.

therefore, leonard's statement is best labeled as sarcastic.",1.0

2. **language style**: the phrase ""oh, how could i be so stu..."" implies a self-deprecating tone, which is a common marker of sarcasm.
3. **emotional words**: the use of ""oh"" and the unfinished ""stu..."" (likely ""stupid"") indicates a heightened emotional response, often found in sarcastic comments.

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

1. **language style**: the statement is delivered in a dry, matter-of-fact tone that is typical of sarcastic remarks.

3. **emotional contrasts**: there is a contrast between the expectation (a winner should be competent) and the reality (the winner cannot make a decent cup of cocoa), which highlights the sarcastic tone.
4. **character context**: knowing sheldon's character from ""the big bang theory,"" he often uses sarcasm to express his disappointment or criticism in a humorous way.

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:
based on the current cues and the context provided, it appears that sheldon is making a humorous and somewhat ironic statement. the idea that someone might specifically want a man with a pocket watch is unexpected and amusing, which aligns with sheldon's character and the show's style of humor. this suggests that the statement is not meant to be taken literally but rather as a humorous or sarcastic remark.

based on the input text and the provided cues, i can confidently label this as:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious contradictions or irony that would indicate sarcasm.
2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.
3. there's no detectable contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **tone of frustration**: amy's statement begins with ""oh, screw her,"" which indicates frustration or disdain, a common precursor to sarcastic remarks.
2. **implied superiority**: the phrase ""she's just lucky we let her hang out with us"" implies a sense of superiority and dismissiveness, suggesting that the inclusion of the person in their social group is a favor rather than a genuine acceptance.
3. **contrast between literal and implied meaning**: the literal meaning of the statement is that the person is fortunate to be included, but the implied meaning, given the context of frustration, is likely that amy does not genuinely believe this person deserves to be part of the group.
4. **mockery**: the statement carries a mocking tone, which is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

therefore, amy's statement appears to be sarcastic, expressing disdain under the guise of a seemingly positive remark.",1.0

the text appears to be a genuinely concerned or anxious statement from monica about a potentially uncomfortable situation. the use of informal language, emotional punctuation (interrobang ?!), and the context of worry about someone's reaction all point to a sincere expression of concern rather than a sarcastic remark. the emotional contrast between the current state and anticipated future reaction further supports the sincerity of the statement. there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm in the phrasing or context provided.","### current cues:

2. **euphemism**: the phrase ""making boom-boom in the potty"" is a childish euphemism for using the toilet, which adds to the ridiculousness of the statement.
3. **implied criticism**: the statement implies that the nobel prize is being awarded for something trivial and unworthy, which is a sarcastic way of criticizing the situation or the person being referred to.
4. **contextual clues**: the context of the statement, likely from a sitcom or comedic dialogue, supports the interpretation of sarcasm.

given these points, leonard's remark is clearly sarcastic, as it uses humor and exaggeration to make a critical point in a mocking manner.",1.0

2. **exaggeration**: the notion that religious people would accuse him of being a witch due to the complexity of his work is an exaggerated and humorous way to criticize their lack of understanding.
3. **tone**: the tone of the statement carries a mocking undertone towards the religious people's reaction, which is a common marker of sarcasm.

while the given cues provide some context, they are not sufficient to definitively determine whether the statement is sarcastic or not. the information provided is mostly factual and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. to detect sarcasm, we would typically need more indicators such as tone, exaggeration, contrast between literal and intended meaning, or additional context about ross's personality or the situation. without more information, it's not possible to confidently determine the sarcastic polarity of this text.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward description of a recent event.
2. there's no indication of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the hesitation in speech (""we- we"") implies sincerity and potentially emotional vulnerability.
4. the context suggests this is part of a personal narrative or conversation, where ross is likely sharing information about his relationship honestly.
5. there are no contradictory elements or unexpected twists that might indicate sarcastic intent.

the text appears to be a genuine statement about ross experiencing his first fight in a relationship, without any sarcastic undertones.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **language style**: the informal and conversational tone can often be a vehicle for sarcasm, especially in personal anecdotes.
2. **emotional contrast**: the contrast between the innocent mention of a box of crayons and the implied discomfort or trauma is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the exaggerated reaction of crossing her legs at the sight of crayons suggests a humorous or sarcastic undertone.
3. **rhetorical devices**: the statement uses hyperbole, a common rhetorical device in sarcasm, to emphasize the lasting impact of the experience in a way that is likely meant to be humorous.
4. **context**: without additional context, the statement appears to be a humorous exaggeration rather than a literal expression of discomfort.

given these cues, the text is likely intended to be sarcastic, using humor to convey the lasting impression of an uncomfortable experience.",1.0

based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **frustration and disappointment**: the cues indicate that the speaker is expressing frustration and disappointment, which are often associated with sarcastic remarks.
2. **content and tone**: the statement ""it's like you're not even trying to get better"" implies a criticism that is likely not meant to be taken literally. the use of ""exactly what it was half an hour ago"" suggests impatience and a lack of progress, which can be a setup for sarcasm.
3. **context**: the context of the conversation, where one person is likely expected to improve or change something, and the lack of perceived effort, supports the interpretation of sarcasm.

while the given cues provide some context, they are not sufficient to definitively determine whether the statement is sarcastic or not. the information provided is mostly factual and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. to detect sarcasm, we would typically need more indicators such as tone, exaggeration, contrast between literal and intended meaning, or additional context about ross's personality or the situation. without more information, it's not possible to confidently determine the sarcastic polarity of this text.

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward description of a recent event.

2. **exaggeration**: the phrase ""looking at creepy in the rearview mirror"" is an exaggerated way of saying they have already been creepy for a while, which adds a layer of sarcasm.
3. **tone**: the tone of the statement, especially with the use of ""oh, i think,"" suggests a casual dismissal of the idea that installing the camera was the point where they became creepy, implying that they were already creepy before that.
4. **context**: the context provided indicates that howard is responding to a suggestion that they had already surpassed the point of being creepy, which aligns with a sarcastic response to downplay the creepiness of his actions.

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **content and context**: bernadette's statement is about someone's driving behavior, specifically their reluctance to go around a bus. the phrase ""i'm sure she finds it charming"" is likely not meant to be taken literally, as it is improbable that someone would genuinely find such behavior charming.
2. **tone and word choice**: the use of ""i'm sure"" in this context is often a sarcastic way to express the opposite of what is being stated. it implies that the speaker actually believes the behavior is not charming at all.
3. **conversational style**: the informal and somewhat exasperated tone of the statement suggests sarcasm, as it is a common way to express frustration or disbelief in a humorous manner.

the text from sheldon contains several cues that suggest a sarcastic tone. the repetition of ""no, no, no"" and the confident assertion ""i'm really good at this"" followed by the request for a hint indicates a playful and possibly sarcastic attitude. the rhetorical question ""does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"" further supports this interpretation, as it seems to mock the complexity or obscurity of the task at hand. the overall informal and conversational style, combined with the exaggerated confidence and the request for a hint, suggests that sheldon is not being entirely serious and is likely using sarcasm.",1.0

howard: right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

steps:
yes.

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

label:
sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

based on the current cues provided, leonard's statement is clearly sarcastic. he contrasts the undesirable gift he received (an ugly, itchy sweater) with the much more desirable gift his brother received (a car) to highlight the absurdity of claiming he was his mother's favorite. this stark contrast and the context of discussing past experiences strongly suggest sarcasm.

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **rhetorical devices**: penny uses humor and irony in her statement. the humor comes from the playful and absurd suggestion that a beer might contain clues, which is unexpected and amusing.
2. **irony**: the irony lies in the fact that she is looking for clues in a place where they are unlikely to be found, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.
3. **context**: the context of the statement suggests that penny is not seriously expecting to find clues in a beer, but rather making a humorous comment.

given these points, the statement is clearly sarcastic, as it uses humor and irony to convey a message that is not meant to be taken literally.",1.0

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
the phrase ""how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"" contains a stark emotional contrast between the seemingly serious inquiry about the duration of time and the harsh, judgmental, and exaggerated term ""demented sex pervert."" this contrast is a strong indicator of sarcasm, as it suggests that the speaker is not genuinely asking a serious question but rather making a mocking or ironic statement. the use of such an extreme and offensive term in a context that appears to be a question further supports the interpretation of sarcasm.",1.0

1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious contradictions or irony that would indicate sarcasm.
2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.
3. there's no detectable contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.

1. **contrast and irony**: amy's statement highlights a stark contrast between her three-year relationship with no significant progress and another woman's two-minute interaction leading to immediate intimacy. this contrast is a common marker of sarcasm.
2. **frustration and jealousy**: the emotional tone of frustration and jealousy suggests that amy is not just stating facts but is likely using sarcasm to emphasize her dissatisfaction.
3. **exaggeration**: the hyperbolic nature of the comparison (three years vs. two minutes) adds to the sarcastic tone, as it exaggerates the situation to make a point.
4. **context**: the context provided indicates that amy is expressing frustration, which often accompanies sarcastic remarks to underscore the speaker's feelings.

sarcastic

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:
penny's statement, ""maybe it's a good thing we came here. it's like a lesson in what not to do,"" appears to be sarcastic. the first part of the statement suggests a positive outlook, but it is immediately followed by a negative observation, which creates a contrast that is often indicative of sarcasm. the use of ""lesson in what not to do"" implies that the situation is so bad that it serves as an example of failure, which is a sarcastic way of highlighting the negative aspects of their current situation.

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

not sarcastic

explanation:
the text appears to be a genuinely concerned or anxious statement from monica about a potentially uncomfortable situation. the use of informal language, emotional punctuation (interrobang ?!), and the context of worry about someone's reaction all point to a sincere expression of concern rather than a sarcastic remark. the emotional contrast between the current state and anticipated future reaction further supports the sincerity of the statement. there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm in the phrasing or context provided.","### response:
based on the provided cues and analysis of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

### explanation:
sheldon's statement employs hyperbole and vivid imagery to describe an exaggerated and highly unlikely scenario (a barn spider laying eggs in someone's nose). this use of extreme exaggeration and the absurdity of the situation suggest that sheldon is not being serious and is likely using sarcasm to make a point or to mock the situation. the tone and content of the statement indicate a sarcastic remark rather than a genuine concern.",1.0

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

label:
based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### explanation:
based on the cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label ""not sarcastic"" to bernadette's statement. here are the reasons:

1. **appreciation and love**: bernadette explicitly states that she loves the fact that someone takes pride in their appearance. this indicates genuine appreciation.
2. **mild frustration**: while there is a mention of inconvenience (having to wait to use the bathroom), it is presented in a light-hearted and humorous manner rather than a mocking or condescending tone.
3. **hyperbole**: the use of hyperbole (exaggerating the time spent on hair to an hour) adds a touch of humor but does not necessarily indicate sarcasm.
4. **conversational tone**: the overall tone is informal and personal, suggesting a genuine expression of feelings rather than sarcasm.

therefore, the text does not display clear sarcastic elements and is better categorized as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrasts**: howard's statement contrasts the positive expression of love and appreciation with the negative act of peeing in the kitchen sink, which is an unusual and inappropriate behavior.
2. **absurdity**: the idea of someone being ""too good"" to pee in the kitchen sink is absurd and unlikely to be a genuine compliment, suggesting a sarcastic tone.
3. **context**: the context implies that howard is likely responding to someone's high standards in a sarcastic manner, as peeing in the kitchen sink is not a common or acceptable behavior.
4. **language style**: the use of ""i love that"" in a context where the behavior being praised is clearly inappropriate adds to the sarcastic nature of the statement.

next_cue_response:context
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

the given cues indicate that the text ""sheldon: so as they say, all good things must come to an end."" contains an emotional contrast between the positive sentiment of ""all good things"" and the negative sentiment of ""must come to an end."" sheldon is acknowledging that something positive is coming to a conclusion. the phrase ""all good things must come to an end"" is a common saying that means enjoyable experiences or positive situations eventually conclude.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.","### response:

sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrast**: the statement has a playful tone juxtaposed with an unpleasant and graphic imagery, which is a common marker of sarcasm.
2. **exaggeration**: the suggestion to ""pop it like a zit"" is an exaggerated and absurd way to describe eating something, indicating a sarcastic intent.
3. **contextual clues**: the casual and dismissive tone of ""oh, just put it in your mouth"" suggests that the speaker is not being serious and is likely making a sarcastic comment to downplay the situation.

the provided cues offer valuable context and analysis, but they are not entirely sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while the rhetorical device of hyperbole is identified, which can be associated with sarcasm, the overall tone and intent remain somewhat ambiguous without additional context or delivery cues (like tone of voice or facial expressions). the statement could be interpreted as a genuine, if humorously exaggerated, apology or as a sarcastic comment, depending on the broader context and delivery. therefore, more information would be needed to confidently determine sarcastic polarity.

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **reference to pop culture**: leonard's statement references ""a disturbance in the force,"" a concept from the star wars universe. this is a humorous and exaggerated way to imply that he will instinctively know when ""she"" arrives, which is not meant to be taken literally.
2. **exaggeration**: the idea that leonard can sense someone entering california airspace is an obvious exaggeration, indicating a sarcastic tone.
3. **contextual clues**: the use of a well-known fictional concept to describe a real-world event suggests that leonard is not being serious but rather making a humorous, sarcastic comment.
4. **character's typical speech**: if leonard is known for making nerdy or pop culture references in a humorous way, this further supports the interpretation of sarcasm.

### reasoning:
1. **juxtaposition**: the text contrasts the serene and timeless elements of the moon and trees with the sudden mention of elizabeth mcnulty's death, creating a stark and thought-provoking comparison. this juxtaposition is often used in sarcasm to highlight absurdity or irony.
2. **context**: raj is observing the surroundings and then abruptly mentions elizabeth mcnulty's death, which seems out of place and could be intended to be ironic or sarcastic.
3. **emotional contrasts**: the initial positive sentiment about the moon and trees is quickly contrasted with the somber note about elizabeth mcnulty's death. this sudden shift in tone can be a hallmark of sarcasm.
4. **language style**: the conversational and informal style, along with the use of ""oh, yes,"" suggests a casual tone that can often accompany sarcastic remarks.
5. **punctuation**: the use of ellipsis (...) indicates a pause or trailing off, which can imply a sarcastic or ironic undertone.

label: not sarcastic

the given text ""joey: nope. op, wait! there he goes."" appears to be a straightforward line of dialogue. it doesn't contain any obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal meaning and the intended meaning. instead, it seems to be a simple, direct observation of something happening in real-time. the speaker (joey) is describing what they're seeing, first denying something, then quickly noticing a change and commenting on it. this kind of statement is typically literal rather than sarcastic.","### response:

based on the provided cues and analysis, i can determine the label for the input text.

the text ""chandler: and then and then you clicked it again, she's dressed. she is a business woman, she is walking down the street and oh oh oh she's naked."" contains several indicators that suggest it might be sarcastic:

1. **excitement and surprise**: the use of ""oh oh oh"" indicates a heightened emotional state, which can be a sign of sarcasm when describing an absurd or exaggerated scenario.
2. **scenario description**: the scenario described by chandler is highly improbable and exaggerated (a woman alternates between being dressed as a businesswoman and being naked as someone clicks a button). this kind of exaggeration is often used in sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of a situation.
3. **informal and conversational tone**: the informal and repetitive language style (""and then and then"") can be indicative of a sarcastic tone, especially when paired with an exaggerated scenario.

given these cues, it is reasonable to label the text as sarcastic.

while there is some uncertainty due to the limited context, i'm fairly confident (at least 60%) that the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues correctly point out the lack of context and inability to determine emotional contrasts, which are often key elements in identifying sarcasm. without additional information or context, it's not possible to reliably detect sarcasm in this brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:context
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

### label:

### reasoning:
chandler's exaggerated self-deprecation and the dramatic way he describes himself as ""hopeless and awkward and desperate for love"" suggest a tone of sarcasm. the over-the-top nature of his statements indicates that he is likely making fun of himself in a sarcastic manner rather than genuinely expressing these feelings.",1.0

the line appears to be a witty, humorous remark from the character chandler, likely from a tv show. the sarcastic tone is evident in the exaggerated statement about something costing ""one husband,"" which is not a literal price but a joking way to suggest something is very expensive or undesirable. this kind of playful hyperbole is characteristic of sarcastic humor.","### response:

2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.
3. there's no detectable contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.

### reasoning:
1. **irony**: chandler's statement ""i'd miss you if i broke up with you"" is ironic because it contrasts the usual expectation of feeling relief or indifference after a breakup with the unexpected sentiment of missing the person.
2. **humor**: the statement adds a layer of humor by presenting an unexpected twist, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
3. **supportive intent**: while chandler mentions he is trying to be supportive, the way he phrases it is humorous and ironic, indicating a sarcastic tone.
4. **context**: the cues suggest that chandler is using irony to express his feelings, which aligns with the characteristics of sarcasm.

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.","### response:

chandler's statement, ""yes, the doctor's say if they remove it, he will die!"" does not exhibit the typical elements of sarcasm. instead, it appears to be a straightforward and serious comment about a medical situation. the use of hyperbole here is to emphasize the severity of the situation rather than to convey sarcasm. the emotional tone is one of concern and fear, which aligns with the context of discussing a potentially fatal medical diagnosis. therefore, the label for this input should be ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious contradictions or irony that would indicate sarcasm.
2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.
3. there's no detectable contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **hyperbole**: the statement ""and i just won a million dollars!"" is an exaggerated claim, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.
2. **context**: without additional context, the claim seems highly improbable and is likely not meant to be taken literally.
3. **language style**: the informal and exclamatory style, combined with the hyperbolic nature of the statement, suggests that chandler is not being serious.
4. **punctuation**: the exclamation mark adds to the dramatic and exaggerated tone, which is often used in sarcastic remarks.
5. **emotional words**: the excitement and joy expressed in the statement can be interpreted as mock excitement, further hinting at sarcasm.

given these cues, chandler's statement is best understood as a sarcastic remark rather than a genuine claim.",1.0

steps:
yes.

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

label:
sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:
chandler's remark is clearly sarcastic. he is implying that the measure or action being discussed is ineffective in keeping kids in school. by phrasing it as a rhetorical question, he is highlighting the inadequacy of the measure in a sarcastic manner.

5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

in the given text, chandler uses a rhetorical device known as ""contrast"" to highlight the difference between crying over a real-life event and crying over a cartoon. by juxtaposing the emotional response to bambi, a fictional character, with the implied expectation of crying over something more serious, chandler emphasizes the perceived absurdity of the situation. chandler is commenting on the appropriateness of crying over a particular situation, suggesting that while he understands crying over certain things, he finds it less understandable to cry over bambi, which he points out is a cartoon.

while there is some uncertainty due to the limited context, i'm fairly confident (at least 60%) that the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues correctly point out the lack of context and inability to determine emotional contrasts, which are often key elements in identifying sarcasm. without additional information or context, it's not possible to reliably detect sarcasm in this brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:context
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

based on the provided cues and the input text ""chandler: because his penis was too big. i am sorry, that’s the kind of thing i do."", i can confidently say that the statement is sarcastic.

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
the cues indicate that chandler is making a humorous or sarcastic remark, which is typical behavior for his character. the statement ""because his penis was too big"" is an exaggerated and humorous explanation, followed by an apology that acknowledges this type of comment is characteristic of him. this combination of humor, exaggeration, and self-awareness is a strong indicator of sarcasm.",1.0

while there's some uncertainty without more context, this single line of dialogue doesn't provide sufficient cues to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the statement could be straightforwardly answering a question, or it could potentially be sarcastic, but there's not enough information from this line alone to make that determination with confidence.
next_cue_response:language style
yes

label:
sarcastic

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:
the given text ""chandler: oh hurry up, i want to sign that."" does not exhibit clear signs of sarcasm. the language style is informal and conversational, and chandler is expressing a straightforward sense of urgency and impatience to sign something. there are no indicators of irony or a sarcastic tone in this statement.

sarcastic

the line appears to be a witty, humorous remark from the character chandler, likely from a tv show. the sarcastic tone is evident in the exaggerated statement about something costing ""one husband,"" which is not a literal price but a joking way to suggest something is very expensive or undesirable. this kind of playful hyperbole is characteristic of sarcastic humor.","### response:

based on the current cues, the text does not contain any emotional contrasts or indicators of sarcasm. chandler is giving a straightforward compliment to joe, praising his craftsmanship. the language style is informal and conversational, and the rhetorical device used is a compliment. there is no indication of sarcasm in chandler's remark, making it a genuine compliment.",0.0

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

based on the current cues and the context provided, it is reasonable to interpret chandler's statement as sarcastic. chandler bing is a character known for his sarcastic humor, and the statement ""well thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it"" is likely meant to be ironic. he is probably implying that the situation being discussed is not critical to the person's livelihood, but the exaggerated expression of relief suggests the opposite, creating a sarcastic tone.

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.

3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
the text ""joey: we got a box."" is a simple, straightforward statement. it does not contain any elements that typically indicate sarcasm, such as irony, exaggerated language, or emotional contrasts. the use of a period at the end of the sentence further suggests that it is a plain statement rather than a sarcastic remark. in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it is more likely that this statement is a genuine, non-sarcastic response.",0.0

i'm about 70% confident in this answer. the cues provided offer a good analysis of the language style and tone, highlighting elements like mild sarcasm, unusual phrasing, and contrasting viewpoints that are often indicative of sarcastic speech. while more context could potentially increase certainty, these cues seem sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in chandler's statement, especially given his character's well-known tendency for sarcasm in the show ""friends.""

label: sarcastic

chandler's statement exhibits classic elements of sarcasm, particularly his deadpan delivery contrasting others' potential amusement with his own affected indifference. the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is a clear example of dry humor, understating his reaction in a way that actually emphasizes the amusing nature of whatever is being discussed. this kind of sardonic comment is very characteristic of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic wit.","### current cues:
- the text contains a colon (:) after ""chandler"" and a period (.) at the end of the sentence.
- chandler is emphasizing that he was literally saying the specific words in question.
- the brief emotional word in the given text is ""actual.""
- the language style in the given text is conversational and informal.

this statement by chandler uses vivid imagery and humor to describe someone's legs moving erratically, almost as if they are not under the person's control. the exaggerated description and the humorous comparison to the legs being ""independent from his body"" suggest a sarcastic tone. chandler is likely making a humorous and exaggerated comment about someone's lack of coordination, which is a common form of sarcasm. therefore, based on the cues and context, this statement can be classified as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

### response:

### label:

the dialogue from chandler contains a contradiction between the statements ""yes you can"" and ""you can't go back in time."" this contradiction, combined with chandler's known tendency for sarcasm, suggests that the initial affirmative statement is meant to be ironic. the emotional contrast between the encouragement and the impossibility further supports the interpretation of sarcasm. therefore, the label for this input is ""sarcastic.""",1.0

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.","### response:

while there's some uncertainty without more context, this single line of dialogue doesn't provide sufficient cues to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the statement could be straightforwardly answering a question, or it could potentially be sarcastic, but there's not enough information from this line alone to make that determination with confidence.

label:
sarcastic

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:
chandler's statement, ""great! now we can do laundry all night. all night laundry!"" appears to be sarcastic. the enthusiasm and repetition of ""all night"" for a typically mundane task like laundry suggest that chandler is not genuinely excited but rather expressing the opposite sentiment in a sarcastic manner.

3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

### label:

1. **content and context**: chandler's statement contrasts what ""some might find amusing"" with what he personally finds ""regular."" this juxtaposition often indicates a sarcastic tone, as it downplays the amusement others might feel.

3. **common knowledge**: chandler is a character from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor. this background knowledge supports the interpretation of his statement as sarcastic.

2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **content and context**: the statement refers to a historical event involving the jamestown colony and king george granting land. this is a factual statement rather than an absurd or exaggerated claim.
2. **language style**: the language is straightforward and informative, without any clear indicators of sarcasm such as hyperbole or irony.
3. **punctuation and tone**: the punctuation and tone do not suggest sarcasm. the use of a colon and periods indicates a formal and factual presentation of information.
4. **common knowledge**: the reference to the jamestown colony and king george is a historical fact, which supports the interpretation that the statement is meant to be taken literally.

given these points, the text does not exhibit the typical characteristics of sarcasm and is more likely to be a straightforward, factual statement.",0.0

4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of hyperbole by exaggerating the urgency and importance of getting up, despite initially downplaying it, creates a humorous contrast and emphasizes the action.
4. **context**: chandler's need to do something quickly and his sudden shift in tone imply that he is being sarcastic about the urgency of the task.

1. **repetition for emphasis**: the phrase ""really really liked"" is used to exaggerate the extent of liking the new couch, which is a common technique in sarcasm.
2. **contextual humor**: chandler is known for his sarcastic humor, and the context suggests he is making a humorous remark about someone's apparent enthusiasm for a new couch.
3. **contrast and misunderstanding**: chandler's comment contrasts a misunderstanding with humor, implying that the situation is not as it seems, which is a typical sarcastic approach.

2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

while these cues provide some context, they are not sufficient on their own to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the given text. chandler's character from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic tone, but without more context or information about the tone and delivery, it's difficult to be certain about the sarcastic intent in this specific line. additional cues like tone indicators, surrounding context, or more detailed dialogue would be needed to make a more confident assessment of sarcasm.

the input text shows clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism.
2. the rhetorical question ""and what would my opening line be?"" suggests chandler is mocking the idea.
3. the abrupt ""excuse me"" at the end appears to be chandler sarcastically imagining a weak opening line, further emphasizing his skepticism about the suggestion.

given chandler's character (likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor), and the context provided in the cues, this response is definitely sarcastic in nature.","### response:

the input text shows signs of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""oh boy"" can be used sarcastically to express a lack of genuine excitement or enthusiasm.

based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
the text ""rachel: all right, cut, let's pick again, pick again."" is a straightforward directive statement. rachel is instructing someone to stop and start over, likely in the context of a performance or recording. there is no indication of irony, mockery, or emotional contrast that would suggest sarcasm. the language style is informal and conversational, and the use of the phrase ""all right"" indicates a calm and directive tone rather than a sarcastic one. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0.0

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

based on the cues provided, the statement ""it's that whole sensitive thing."" by joey can be analyzed as follows:

- **language style**: informal and conversational.
- **emotional contrast**: between sensitivity and the implied lack of sensitivity.
- **keywords**: sensitive thing.
- **topic**: sensitivity.
- **rhetorical device**: colloquialism.
- **punctuation**: apostrophe and period.

### label:
sarcastic

### explanation:
the phrase ""it's that whole sensitive thing."" can be interpreted as sarcastic because joey's use of ""that whole"" suggests a dismissive or minimizing attitude towards sensitivity. the informal and conversational tone, combined with the context of discussing sensitivity, implies that joey might be downplaying or mocking the concept of being sensitive. this subtle mockery or irony is a common indicator of sarcasm. therefore, based on the cues and the context, the statement is labeled as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

sheldon: frankly, mom, i'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become-- willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.

steps:
yes

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

label:
based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.","### response:

### explanation:
the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. ross's statement, ""for what? for letting you throw me out of your office?"" is a prime example of sarcasm. he is questioning why he should be grateful for being thrown out, which is inherently a negative experience. the emotional contrast between frustration and the implied expectation of gratitude creates a sarcastic tone. ross's rhetorical question emphasizes the absurdity of the situation, further underscoring the sarcastic nature of his remark.",1.0

sarcastic

the line appears to be a witty, humorous remark from the character chandler, likely from a tv show. the sarcastic tone is evident in the exaggerated statement about something costing ""one husband,"" which is not a literal price but a joking way to suggest something is very expensive or undesirable. this kind of playful hyperbole is characteristic of sarcastic humor.","### response:

while there is some uncertainty, the cues provided offer strong indications of emotional contrasts and extreme reactions that are often associated with sarcasm. the rapid shift from excitement to anger and harsh judgment, along with the exaggerated language, suggests a potentially sarcastic tone. however, it's important to note that context beyond these cues would provide even greater certainty in determining sarcastic polarity.

based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign a label to this input:

label: not sarcastic

the text shows a genuine emotional outburst with clear progression from shock to anger to a harsh judgment. the exclamations and the rapid shift in emotions indicate sincere, intense feelings rather than sarcastic undertones. the directness of the statements, especially the final accusation ""you are just a horrible person!"", suggests that rachel is expressing her true feelings without any irony or sarcasm.","### current cues:
the topic is about someone needing to act surprised.; joey is instructing someone to pretend to be surprised.; the rhetorical device used in the text ""you'd better act surprised"" by joey is an imperative sentence. this type of sentence gives a command or instruction, urging the listener to perform a specific action.; the brief emotional contrast in the text is between the expectation of surprise and the need to act surprised. joey is implying that the person should display an emotion (surprise) that they may not genuinely feel.

### input:
joey: you'd better act surprised.

### response:

### label:
sarcastic

the imperative sentence ""you'd better act surprised"" suggests that joey is aware that the person may not genuinely feel surprised and is instructing them to fake it. this implies a level of irony and insincerity, which are key indicators of sarcasm. the emotional contrast between the expectation of genuine surprise and the need to act surprised further supports the sarcastic tone.",1.0

while there is some uncertainty due to the limited context, i'm fairly confident (at least 60%) that the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues correctly point out the lack of context and inability to determine emotional contrasts, which are often key elements in identifying sarcasm. without additional information or context, it's not possible to reliably detect sarcasm in this brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:context
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:language style
yes

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
based on the provided cues and the input text ""rachel: okay, you guys, just relax. i doooo."", it appears that rachel is trying to calm others down in a casual and relaxed manner. the use of informal language and the elongation of ""doooo"" suggest a friendly and reassuring tone rather than a sarcastic one. there is no indication of irony or emotional contrast that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, the statement is more likely to be sincere and non-sarcastic.",0.0

howard: right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

steps:
yes.

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

label:
sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### current cues:
the given text ""chandler: excellent hole, joe."" contains the rhetorical device of **praise**. chandler is complimenting joe on his performance, which can be seen as a form of positive reinforcement or encouragement.;chandler is complimenting joe on a well-executed action, likely in a game or activity involving creating or navigating holes.;the text ""chandler: excellent hole, joe."" does not provide explicit emotional contrasts. it simply conveys a positive remark from chandler to joe, indicating approval or satisfaction.;the language style in the given text is informal and conversational.;chandler, excellent hole, joe.;the brief topic information from the given text is: chandler complimenting joe on an excellent hole.;the text contains a colon (:) and a period (.).;chandler is complimenting joe on an excellent hole.;""excellent""

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe these cues are not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this text. the given keywords and sentence alone don't provide clear indicators of sarcastic intent. more context about the tone, situation, or surrounding dialogue would likely be needed to make a confident determination about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:context
no

while the given cues provide some context, they are not sufficient to definitively determine whether the statement is sarcastic or not. the information provided is mostly factual and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. to detect sarcasm, we would typically need more indicators such as tone, exaggeration, contrast between literal and intended meaning, or additional context about ross's personality or the situation. without more information, it's not possible to confidently determine the sarcastic polarity of this text.

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward description of a recent event.

4. the context suggests this is part of a personal narrative or conversation, where ross is likely sharing information about his relationship honestly.
5. there are no contradictory elements or unexpected twists that might indicate sarcastic intent.

the text appears to be a genuine statement about ross experiencing his first fight in a relationship, without any sarcastic undertones.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **exaggeration and hyperbole**: rachel's statement ""you are just a horrible person!"" is an exaggerated expression of disapproval, which can often be a sign of sarcasm.
2. **emotional contrast**: the strong emotional outburst and the use of multiple exclamations suggest a heightened emotional state, which can sometimes be associated with sarcastic remarks.
3. **context and tone**: the informal and conversational language style, combined with the intense frustration and anger, indicates that rachel might be using sarcasm to emphasize her point.
4. **rhetorical devices**: the use of exclamations and hyperbole are common in sarcastic statements to convey a sense of irony or mockery.

given these cues, it is reasonable to interpret rachel's statement as sarcastic, as the exaggerated language and emotional intensity suggest a possible sarcastic intent.",1.0

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

based on the cues provided, the statement ""ross: we- we had our first fight this morning."" appears to be a straightforward declaration of a recent event. ross is simply stating that he and someone else had their first argument earlier in the day. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or contradiction in this statement. the conversational and informal language style further supports the interpretation that this is a sincere expression of a negative experience.

while i'm not 100% certain, i'm about 70% confident that these punctuation cues alone are not sufficient to detect sarcasm in this text. the punctuation mainly indicates pauses and hesitation, which could be present in both sincere and sarcastic speech. without additional context, tone indicators, or content analysis, it's difficult to determine sarcasm based solely on these punctuation cues.

no

while the provided cues offer some insight into the structure and potential context of the statement, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. the punctuation and brief context analysis don't provide enough information to determine whether the speaker is being sarcastic or sincere. sarcasm often relies on tone of voice, broader context, and knowledge of the speaker's personality or the situation, which are not fully captured in these cues alone.

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward, albeit hesitant, admission from ross about the existence of ""someone else"" in a likely romantic context. the hesitation, repetition, and nervous language (""umm"", ""there's-there's"") indicate genuine discomfort and seriousness, which is inconsistent with sarcasm. the content and delivery suggest this is a sincere, potentially relationship-altering confession, rather than a sarcastic remark.","### response:

the statement ""nobody sees the king!"" is direct and authoritative, emphasizing the exclusivity and inaccessibility of the king. the use of hyperbole and the exclamation mark suggest a strong emphasis on the point being made, rather than sarcasm. the emotional contrast and keywords indicate a serious tone, focusing on the restricted access to the king. there is no indication of irony or mockery that would suggest sarcasm. therefore, the statement is best interpreted as a sincere assertion about the king's inaccessibility.",0.0

2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.
3. there's no detectable contrast between the literal meaning and any implied meaning.
4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **keywords**: the text contains the word ""yeah,"" which is a common affirmative response. without additional context, it is difficult to infer sarcasm from this alone.
2. **context**: the provided text is very brief and lacks sufficient context to determine any underlying sarcasm.
3. **language style**: the language is informal and conversational, which is typical for straightforward communication.
4. **punctuation**: the period after ""yeah"" suggests a simple, declarative statement rather than an exclamatory or questioning tone that might hint at sarcasm.
5. **emotional words**: there are no specific emotional words in the text that would indicate sarcasm.
6. **common knowledge**: the text is too brief to apply any common knowledge effectively.

given the lack of clear indicators of sarcasm and the straightforward nature of the response, it is reasonable to label this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as:

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the context provided indicates that chandler is admitting to making up a game, which suggests a situation where he might be expected to defend the game's authenticity.
2. **emotional contrasts**: there is a contrast between the expectation (that the game is real) and the admission (that it is not real), which can be a setup for sarcasm.
3. **rhetorical devices**: the exclamatory nature of ""it's not a real game! i made it up!"" can indicate a sarcastic tone, as chandler might be emphasizing the obviousness of the statement.
4. **keywords**: the phrase ""i made it up!"" can be seen as a punchline, often used in sarcastic contexts to highlight the absurdity of believing otherwise.
5. **emotional words**: the use of exclamation marks suggests a heightened emotional state, which can be associated with sarcasm.
6. **punctuation**: the exclamation marks add to the sarcastic tone, indicating that chandler might be expressing frustration or mock surprise.
7. **topic**: the topic itself, involving the admission of a made-up game, lends itself to a sarcastic interpretation, as chandler might be mocking the seriousness with which the game was taken.

given these cues, chandler's statement appears to be sarcastic, as he is likely emphasizing the obviousness of the game's lack of authenticity in a mocking manner.",1.0

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### label:

while these cues provide useful information about the language style and context, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this short text. sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, broader context, and knowledge of the speaker's typical manner of expression, which are not fully captured in these linguistic cues alone. there's significant uncertainty about whether this statement is meant to be taken at face value or sarcastically without more context.

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and descriptive, using simple adjectives ""old"" and ""dingy"" to describe something.
2. there's no apparent contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typical in sarcasm.
3. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than exaggerated or mocking, which are common in sarcastic statements.
4. the phrase ""that's all"" suggests a simple, direct conclusion rather than any hidden meaning.
5. the informal, conversational style is consistent with genuine speech rather than sarcastic intent.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, in this case, joey's statement appears to be a sincere description without any indicators of sarcastic undertones.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **straightforward declaration**: the statement ""so to sum up, i'm professor geller"" is a clear and direct declaration of identity.
2. **lack of emotional contrast**: there is no emotional contrast or undertone that would suggest sarcasm. the statement is factual and lacks any exaggerated or mocking tone.
3. **context**: the context provided indicates that ross is summarizing or concluding a discussion by identifying himself, which aligns with a straightforward and sincere statement.
4. **rhetorical device**: the use of the epithet ""professor geller"" emphasizes his professional identity, which is consistent with a genuine statement rather than a sarcastic one.
5. **punctuation and language style**: the punctuation and informal, conversational style do not indicate any sarcastic intent.

based on these points, the statement by ross appears to be sincere and not sarcastic.",0.0

while i cannot be 100% certain without more context, based solely on the given text and cues, there does not appear to be sufficient information to detect sarcastic polarity. the statement seems relatively straightforward, and the analysis provided does not indicate any clear markers of sarcasm. however, there is some uncertainty, as sarcasm can sometimes be subtle or dependent on broader context not provided here.

no

while the provided cues give some context about bernadette's statement, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the text. the cues describe the statement as straightforward and lacking clear emotional contrasts, which suggests an absence of sarcasm. however, without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to be completely certain about the presence or absence of sarcasm in this isolated statement.

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and doesn't contain any obvious contradictions or irony that would indicate sarcasm.
2. the language is casual and sincere, expressing a genuine desire for a familiar experience.

4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **straightforward statement**: joey's statement is direct and lacks any obvious contradictions or irony.
2. **language style**: the language is informal and conversational, which suggests a genuine observation rather than a sarcastic remark.
3. **rhetorical device**: the use of hypophora (raising a question and then answering it) indicates a logical explanation rather than sarcasm.
4. **context**: the context provided suggests a simple cause-and-effect relationship (hunger leading to action), which is typically expressed sincerely.
5. **emotional contrast**: the brief emotional contrast between hunger and the action of coming in does not imply sarcasm but rather a natural consequence.

while there is some uncertainty due to the limited context, i'm fairly confident (at least 60%) that the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues correctly point out the lack of context and inability to determine emotional contrasts, which are often key elements in identifying sarcasm. without additional information or context, it's not possible to reliably detect sarcasm in this brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:context
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:language style
yes

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

the text ""monica: well, don't 'cha wanna?"" appears to be a straightforward question posed by monica. the informal and conversational language style, along with the use of colloquialism (""don't 'cha""), suggests that monica is genuinely asking if the other person wants to do something. there is no clear indication of sarcasm, such as irony or exaggerated contrast, in the text. therefore, based on the given cues and the nature of the question, it is more likely that the statement is not sarcastic.",0.0

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

based on the given input and cues, chandler's statement appears to have a sarcastic tone. the use of the phrase ""your little breakfast adventure"" suggests a mocking or ironic attitude, implying that the incident was not as trivial as it sounds. additionally, the context of blaming someone for the condition of the furniture adds to the sarcastic undertone.

while punctuation can sometimes provide hints about tone, the given punctuation information alone is not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this text. sarcasm often relies on context, word choice, and knowledge of the situation being discussed, which are not captured by simple punctuation analysis. more comprehensive linguistic and contextual cues would be needed to accurately identify sarcastic intent.

the provided cues are not sufficient to definitively detect the sarcastic polarity of the text. while the punctuation information and the observation about the humorous or absurd claim provide some context, they don't offer enough evidence to conclusively determine sarcasm. additional cues such as tone indicators, broader context, or more detailed analysis of the language used would be necessary to make a more confident assessment of sarcastic intent.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i believe i can reliably assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the content of the statement is absurd and highly unlikely (a famous actor living in a broom closet), which is a common characteristic of sarcastic statements.
2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **repetition and emphasis**: the repetition of ""what"" emphasizes rachel's surprise and disbelief, which is often a marker of sarcasm.
2. **absurdity**: the idea of staying married forever is presented in a way that suggests it is unrealistic or undesirable, which can be a sarcastic way to express skepticism or disbelief.
3. **conversational tone**: the informal and conversational tone of the statement aligns with how sarcasm is often conveyed in everyday speech.
4. **context**: rachel's questioning tone and the use of a rhetorical question suggest that she is not genuinely seeking an answer but rather expressing her incredulity in a sarcastic manner.

given these cues, it is reasonable to conclude that rachel's statement is intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### current cues:

### response:
the text ""rachel: ohhh!!!!"" suggests a strong emotional reaction, likely indicating surprise, excitement, or shock. however, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this reaction is sarcastic or genuine. the use of multiple exclamation marks and the elongated ""ohhh"" indicate a heightened emotional state, but do not provide enough information to definitively label the statement as sarcastic or not sarcastic.

while the given cues provide some context, they are not sufficient to definitively determine whether the statement is sarcastic or not. the information provided is mostly factual and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. to detect sarcasm, we would typically need more indicators such as tone, exaggeration, contrast between literal and intended meaning, or additional context about ross's personality or the situation. without more information, it's not possible to confidently determine the sarcastic polarity of this text.

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward description of a recent event.
2. there's no indication of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the hesitation in speech (""we- we"") implies sincerity and potentially emotional vulnerability.
4. the context suggests this is part of a personal narrative or conversation, where ross is likely sharing information about his relationship honestly.
5. there are no contradictory elements or unexpected twists that might indicate sarcastic intent.

the text appears to be a genuine statement about ross experiencing his first fight in a relationship, without any sarcastic undertones.","### response:

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as:

**sarcastic**

### reasoning:
1. **repetition and rhetorical device**: rachel's use of repetition (""wait, wait"") serves as a rhetorical device to emphasize her surprise or disbelief.
2. **rhetorical question**: the rhetorical question (""this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner?"") is used to express her astonishment and prompt chandler to reconsider his choice.
3. **context**: the context suggests that rachel is questioning chandler's choice of food for thanksgiving dinner, which implies that she finds it unusual or inappropriate.
4. **emotional contrast**: rachel's surprise or disbelief contrasts with what would be a normal reaction to a typical thanksgiving dinner choice, indicating a sarcastic tone.

the combination of these elements strongly suggests that rachel's statement is sarcastic.",1.0

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### label:

this statement from chandler is a straightforward question asking for help with a crossword puzzle clue. there are no indicators of sarcasm in the text. the language is direct, informal, and typical of someone seeking genuine assistance. the context and tone do not suggest any hidden meaning or irony that would characterize sarcasm.","based on the given input and the current cues provided, i can confidently output the result directly:

while there is some uncertainty due to the limited context, i'm fairly confident (at least 60%) that the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues correctly point out the lack of context and inability to determine emotional contrasts, which are often key elements in identifying sarcasm. without additional information or context, it's not possible to reliably detect sarcasm in this brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:context
no

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe the given cues are not sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""joey: no!"". the cues mainly point out the lack of context, which makes it difficult to determine any emotional nuances or sarcasm. without more surrounding information or tone indicators, it's challenging to confidently assess whether sarcasm is present or not in such a brief exclamation.
next_cue_response:language style

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

based on the provided cues and the input text ""person: ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."", i can confidently say that the statement is not sarcastic. the repetition of ""ow"" and ""leg cramp"" clearly indicates that the person is experiencing genuine pain and discomfort. the informal and repetitive language style further emphasizes the urgency and intensity of the situation, which is consistent with a sincere expression of pain rather than sarcasm.

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and descriptive, using simple adjectives ""old"" and ""dingy"" to describe something.
2. there's no apparent contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typical in sarcasm.
3. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than exaggerated or mocking, which are common in sarcastic statements.
4. the phrase ""that's all"" suggests a simple, direct conclusion rather than any hidden meaning.

1. **hyperbole**: chandler uses exaggeration by mentioning ""chasing the churo guy"" to emphasize that it is not a form of exercise, which is a common rhetorical device in sarcasm.
2. **contrast**: there is a clear contrast between what is being said (chasing the churo guy) and what is meant (that it is not a serious form of jogging or exercise).
3. **tone**: the tone of the statement is dismissive and mocking, which aligns with sarcastic speech.

while these cues provide some context, they are not sufficient on their own to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the given text. chandler's character from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic tone, but without more context or information about the tone and delivery, it's difficult to be certain about the sarcastic intent in this specific line. additional cues like tone indicators, surrounding context, or more detailed dialogue would be needed to make a more confident assessment of sarcasm.

the input text shows clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism.
2. the rhetorical question ""and what would my opening line be?"" suggests chandler is mocking the idea.
3. the abrupt ""excuse me"" at the end appears to be chandler sarcastically imagining a weak opening line, further emphasizing his skepticism about the suggestion.

given chandler's character (likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor), and the context provided in the cues, this response is definitely sarcastic in nature.","### response:

the input text shows signs of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""i still don't know how that happened"" is ironic because the process of getting someone pregnant is generally well understood. this statement highlights a contrast between the expected knowledge and the speaker's claimed ignorance.
2. the context of discussing an unexpected pregnancy adds to the irony, as it is unlikely that the speaker genuinely does not understand how the pregnancy occurred.

1. **rhetorical devices**: chandler uses humor and self-deprecation, which are common in sarcastic speech. by saying ""i don't know if you got any of that,"" he humorously implies that his request might have been unclear, even though it likely wasn't.
2. **emotional contrasts**: there's a contrast between the uncertainty expressed (""i don't know if you got any of that"") and the clear desire (""i would really like a copy of the tape""), which can indicate sarcasm.
3. **tone**: the informal and conversational style, combined with the humorous self-deprecation, suggests a sarcastic tone.
4. **context**: knowing chandler's character from ""friends,"" he often uses sarcasm and humor in his speech, which supports the interpretation of this statement as sarcastic.

given these cues, chandler's statement appears to be sarcastic rather than a straightforward request.",1.0

while these cues provide some context, they are not sufficient on their own to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the given text. chandler's character from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic tone, but without more context or information about the tone and delivery, it's difficult to be certain about the sarcastic intent in this specific line. additional cues like tone indicators, surrounding context, or more detailed dialogue would be needed to make a more confident assessment of sarcasm.

1. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism.
2. the rhetorical question ""and what would my opening line be?"" suggests chandler is mocking the idea.
3. the abrupt ""excuse me"" at the end appears to be chandler sarcastically imagining a weak opening line, further emphasizing his skepticism about the suggestion.

given chandler's character (likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor), and the context provided in the cues, this response is definitely sarcastic in nature.","### response:

the given text ""joey: nope. op, wait! there he goes."" appears to be a straightforward line of dialogue. it doesn't contain any obvious indicators of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal meaning and the intended meaning. instead, it seems to be a simple, direct observation of something happening in real-time. the speaker (joey) is describing what they're seeing, first denying something, then quickly noticing a change and commenting on it. this kind of statement is typically literal rather than sarcastic.","### response:

yes

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.","### response:

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward, albeit hesitant, admission from ross about the existence of ""someone else"" in a likely romantic context. the hesitation, repetition, and nervous language (""umm"", ""there's-there's"") indicate genuine discomfort and seriousness, which is inconsistent with sarcasm. the content and delivery suggest this is a sincere, potentially relationship-altering confession, rather than a sarcastic remark.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### explanation:
the text provided is a direct plea from person1, who is expressing urgency and desperation for someone not to leave. the repetition of ""please"" and the informal, conversational tone indicate a sincere request rather than a sarcastic remark. the emotional weight and context of the statement suggest genuine concern and earnestness, which are inconsistent with sarcasm.",0.0

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe these cues are not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this text. the given keywords and sentence alone don't provide clear indicators of sarcastic intent. more context about the tone, situation, or surrounding dialogue would likely be needed to make a confident determination about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:context
no

while the given cues provide some context, they are not sufficient to definitively determine whether the statement is sarcastic or not. the information provided is mostly factual and doesn't inherently suggest sarcasm. to detect sarcasm, we would typically need more indicators such as tone, exaggeration, contrast between literal and intended meaning, or additional context about ross's personality or the situation. without more information, it's not possible to confidently determine the sarcastic polarity of this text.

my judgment is that these cues are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. the provided information gives context about the speaker, situation, and language style, but does not provide clear indicators of sarcasm. sarcasm often relies on tone, context beyond what's given here, and more extensive language cues that are not present in this brief statement. while i'm not 100% certain, i'm confident enough to answer ""no"" within the allowed 40% uncertainty margin.

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement is a straightforward description of a recent event.
2. there's no indication of irony or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the hesitation in speech (""we- we"") implies sincerity and potentially emotional vulnerability.
4. the context suggests this is part of a personal narrative or conversation, where ross is likely sharing information about his relationship honestly.
5. there are no contradictory elements or unexpected twists that might indicate sarcastic intent.

the text appears to be a genuine statement about ross experiencing his first fight in a relationship, without any sarcastic undertones.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **language style**: the informal and conversational tone can often be a vehicle for sarcasm, especially in casual dialogue.
2. **context**: ross is agreeing with someone, but the statement ""even if it's to say something complementary"" introduces a contrast that can imply sarcasm. it suggests that saying something complimentary is unexpected or unusual, which can be a sarcastic way of highlighting the rarity or insincerity of compliments.
3. **emotional contrast**: the expectation of a positive comment (complimentary) is contrasted with an underlying tension or hesitation, which is a common feature in sarcastic remarks.
4. **rhetorical devices**: the phrase ""even if"" can be used to downplay the significance of the compliment, adding a layer of irony.
5. **common knowledge**: in everyday conversation, people often use sarcasm to make a point about the rarity or insincerity of compliments, especially if they feel the compliment is not genuine.

given these cues, the statement by ross likely carries a sarcastic undertone.",1.0

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward request without any clear indicators of sarcasm. monica is simply asking for the return of a kitchen item (a broiling pan) that was borrowed by joey. the informal, conversational tone and the use of filler words like ""uh"" and phrases like ""listen"" suggest a casual, sincere communication rather than a sarcastic one. there are no apparent contradictions, exaggerations, or ironic elements that would typically signal sarcasm. therefore, based on the available information and context, this statement can be classified as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

rachel's statement ""oh-oh, that's a risky little game!"" contains several indicators of sarcasm. the use of ""oh-oh"" and the exclamation mark suggests a heightened emotional response, which can often be a sign of sarcasm. additionally, the phrase ""risky little game"" can be interpreted as downplaying the seriousness of the situation, which is a common sarcastic technique. the informal and conversational tone further supports the interpretation that rachel is being sarcastic about the perceived riskiness of the situation.",1.0

while there is some uncertainty, the cues provided offer strong indications of emotional contrasts and extreme reactions that are often associated with sarcasm. the rapid shift from excitement to anger and harsh judgment, along with the exaggerated language, suggests a potentially sarcastic tone. however, it's important to note that context beyond these cues would provide even greater certainty in determining sarcastic polarity.

the text shows a genuine emotional outburst with clear progression from shock to anger to a harsh judgment. the exclamations and the rapid shift in emotions indicate sincere, intense feelings rather than sarcastic undertones. the directness of the statements, especially the final accusation ""you are just a horrible person!"", suggests that rachel is expressing her true feelings without any irony or sarcasm.","### response:

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

not sarcastic

### reasoning:
the text shows rachel emphatically denying or rejecting something, which suggests a genuine reaction rather than a sarcastic one. the repeated use of ""no"" and the fragmented, interrupted speech pattern indicate a strong emotional response, likely confusion or frustration. sarcasm often involves a more subtle or ironic tone, which is not evident in this text. the informal and conversational language style further supports the interpretation of a sincere reaction. therefore, based on the cues and the input text, it is more likely that rachel's statement is not sarcastic.",0.0

4. the context suggests a simple preference for comfort and routine, which is typically expressed genuinely rather than sarcastically.
5. the tone is neutral to positive, without any hints of mockery or exaggeration that often accompany sarcasm.

therefore, bernadette's statement appears to be a sincere expression of wanting a familiar dining experience, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **exclamation mark**: the use of an exclamation mark suggests heightened emotion, which can often accompany sarcasm.
2. **surprise or realization**: joey's expression of surprise or realization (""whoa, maybe i was!"") can be interpreted as sarcastic, especially if he is acknowledging something he previously denied or was unaware of.
3. **informal and conversational style**: the casual tone can sometimes mask sarcasm, making it seem more genuine.
4. **contextual clues**: without additional context, joey's sudden acknowledgment can be seen as a sarcastic admission, especially if it follows a conversation where he was in denial or being accused of something.

given these cues, joey's statement likely carries a sarcastic undertone, indicating a shift from denial to a mock acknowledgment.",1.0

howard: right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

yes.

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

label:
sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

based on the cues provided, chandler's statement appears to be sarcastic. the rhetorical question ""just look at them i mean, is it okay if they come visit?"" suggests that chandler is implying the answer should be obvious, likely indicating that the guys are not in a state to visit or that it should be clear they should not be allowed to visit. this use of a rhetorical question and the informal, conversational tone are common indicators of sarcasm.

based on the provided cues and the input text ""joey: no!"", i can confidently say that there is not enough context to determine whether this statement is sarcastic or not. a simple exclamation like this could be genuine or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone of voice, and situation, none of which are provided here.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
the text ""ross umm, there's something that i've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else."" does not exhibit characteristics typically associated with sarcasm. the language style is informal and conversational, with filler words and hesitations indicating discomfort and hesitation. the emotional contrast and rhetorical devices used (such as ellipsis) suggest that ross is struggling to convey a difficult truth, which is more aligned with a sincere and serious tone rather than a sarcastic one. therefore, based on the cues and the context provided, the statement is more likely to be straightforward and non-sarcastic.",0.0

steps:
no

while these cues provide some context, they are not sufficient on their own to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in the given text. chandler's character from the tv show ""friends"" is known for his sarcastic tone, but without more context or information about the tone and delivery, it's difficult to be certain about the sarcastic intent in this specific line. additional cues like tone indicators, surrounding context, or more detailed dialogue would be needed to make a more confident assessment of sarcasm.

yes

label:
sarcastic

the input text shows clear signs of sarcasm:

1. the phrase ""oh yeah right"" is often used sarcastically to express disbelief or skepticism.
2. the rhetorical question ""and what would my opening line be?"" suggests chandler is mocking the idea.
3. the abrupt ""excuse me"" at the end appears to be chandler sarcastically imagining a weak opening line, further emphasizing his skepticism about the suggestion.

given chandler's character (likely referring to chandler bing from the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic humor), and the context provided in the cues, this response is definitely sarcastic in nature.","### response:

the given text does not exhibit clear signs of sarcasm. chandler's statement, ""yeah, i mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now,"" appears to be a straightforward expression of politeness and consideration for others. there are no rhetorical questions, exaggerated expressions, or other typical markers of sarcasm present in the text. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0.0

reasoning:
1. the statement is straightforward and descriptive, using simple adjectives ""old"" and ""dingy"" to describe something.
2. there's no apparent contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is typical in sarcasm.
3. the tone seems matter-of-fact rather than exaggerated or mocking, which are common in sarcastic statements.
4. the phrase ""that's all"" suggests a simple, direct conclusion rather than any hidden meaning.
5. the informal, conversational style is consistent with genuine speech rather than sarcastic intent.

while sarcasm can sometimes be subtle, in this case, joey's statement appears to be a sincere description without any indicators of sarcastic undertones.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the statement implies that enduring something for ""twenty-one hours"" will make someone a ""hero,"" which seems exaggerated and unlikely to be taken literally.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the contrast between the relatively short duration (""twenty-one hours"") and the significant recognition (""you're a hero"") suggests an ironic or sarcastic tone.
3. **keywords**: the use of ""hero"" in this context is likely hyperbolic, indicating sarcasm.
4. **common knowledge**: typically, becoming a ""hero"" is associated with significant, often prolonged efforts or achievements, not just enduring something for a short period like twenty-one hours.

given these cues, the statement appears to be sarcastic, as it exaggerates the outcome of a relatively minor effort.",1.0

the text appears to be a genuinely concerned or anxious statement from monica about a potentially uncomfortable situation. the use of informal language, emotional punctuation (interrobang ?!), and the context of worry about someone's reaction all point to a sincere expression of concern rather than a sarcastic remark. the emotional contrast between the current state and anticipated future reaction further supports the sincerity of the statement. there are no clear indicators of irony or sarcasm in the phrasing or context provided.","### response:

### label:
not sarcastic

### explanation:
the text ""phoebe: the end."" is a straightforward, declarative statement indicating the conclusion of something. there are no indicators of irony, sarcasm, or emotional contrasts in the phrasing. the language style is concise and direct, and the context provided is minimal, making it difficult to infer any sarcastic intent. therefore, based on the cues and analysis, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0.0

steps:
no

while i'm not 100% certain, i'm about 70% confident that these punctuation cues alone are not sufficient to detect sarcasm in this text. the punctuation mainly indicates pauses and hesitation, which could be present in both sincere and sarcastic speech. without additional context, tone indicators, or content analysis, it's difficult to determine sarcasm based solely on these punctuation cues.
next_cue_response:context
no

while the provided cues offer some insight into the structure and potential context of the statement, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. the punctuation and brief context analysis don't provide enough information to determine whether the speaker is being sarcastic or sincere. sarcasm often relies on tone of voice, broader context, and knowledge of the speaker's personality or the situation, which are not fully captured in these cues alone.

not sarcastic

this dialogue appears to be a straightforward, albeit hesitant, admission from ross about the existence of ""someone else"" in a likely romantic context. the hesitation, repetition, and nervous language (""umm"", ""there's-there's"") indicate genuine discomfort and seriousness, which is inconsistent with sarcasm. the content and delivery suggest this is a sincere, potentially relationship-altering confession, rather than a sarcastic remark.","### response:

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

**not sarcastic**

### reasoning:
the dialogue appears to be a straightforward, conversational interaction. the person is momentarily interrupted, invites someone in, and then instructs another party to think about something and call back later. the language style is informal and conversational, with interjections and casual phrases indicating a natural flow of dialogue. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggerated tone, irony, or contradictory statements. the emotional contrasts and punctuation cues suggest genuine communication rather than sarcastic intent.",0.0

howard: right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

steps:
yes.

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

label:
sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

phoebe's statement ""yeah. yeah, that's what you need a good .. pill."" is sarcastic. the repetition of ""yeah. yeah."" followed by the suggestion of needing a ""good .. pill"" indicates a dismissive or mocking tone, implying that the solution being suggested is overly simplistic or not serious. this contrast creates the sarcasm in her statement.",1.0

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently label this as:

**sarcastic**

### reasoning:
1. **humor and understatement**: joey uses humor and understatement to describe the state of his room and hamper. this downplays the actual condition in a light-hearted manner, which is a common technique in sarcasm.
2. **implied contrast**: the statement implies that the condition of his room and hamper is worse than he is letting on, which creates a contrast between the literal meaning and the intended meaning.
3. **context**: joey's character is known for his humorous and often sarcastic remarks, which adds to the likelihood that this statement is sarcastic.
4. **tone**: the casual and dismissive tone (""yeah well that's because uh .. i stayed in my room. yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper."") suggests that joey is not being entirely serious.

the text appears to be a sarcastic remark about the state of joey's room and hamper, using humor to downplay the actual condition.",1.0

i'm about 70% confident in this answer. the cues provided offer a good analysis of the language style and tone, highlighting elements like mild sarcasm, unusual phrasing, and contrasting viewpoints that are often indicative of sarcastic speech. while more context could potentially increase certainty, these cues seem sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in chandler's statement, especially given his character's well-known tendency for sarcasm in the show ""friends.""

chandler's statement exhibits classic elements of sarcasm, particularly his deadpan delivery contrasting others' potential amusement with his own affected indifference. the phrase ""i myself find it regular"" is a clear example of dry humor, understating his reaction in a way that actually emphasizes the amusing nature of whatever is being discussed. this kind of sardonic comment is very characteristic of chandler's character in the tv show ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic wit.","### label:

rachel's statement, ""i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"" exhibits elements of sarcasm. the phrase ""i guess"" introduces a tone of uncertainty or doubt, which is often used sarcastically to imply the opposite. additionally, the phrase ""being one of the two of us"" suggests a level of obviousness that rachel is highlighting, likely to point out something that should be clear to the other person. this combination of mild frustration and the highlighting of an obvious fact is characteristic of sarcastic speech.",1.0

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.

however, since you've asked me to choose a label between 'not sarcastic' and 'sarcastic', i will make a judgment based on the limited information available:

label: not sarcastic

reasoning: in the absence of additional context that might suggest otherwise, it's more likely that this exclamation is a straightforward, non-sarcastic response. the use of an exclamation mark typically denotes emphasis or strong emotion, which is more commonly associated with sincere reactions rather than sarcastic ones. sarcasm often relies on more complex linguistic structures or situational irony, which are not evident in this brief statement.","### response:

2. the informal, conversational tone and the use of ""ofcourse"" at the beginning suggest a sarcastic response to a previous question or statement.
3. the misspelling of cary grant's name as ""carrey grant"" adds to the overall humorous or exaggerated tone of the statement.
4. the context of responding to ""ma"" (mother) with such an outlandish claim further supports the sarcastic nature of the dialogue.

while sarcasm can sometimes be difficult to detect without additional context or tone of voice, the combination of the absurd content and the conversational style strongly suggests that this statement is intended to be sarcastic rather than a genuine, factual claim.","### response:

### reasoning:
1. **content**: the statement ""no i am upset because crocodin turbs are wearing darker colors"" does not contain any absurd or highly unlikely claims. it seems to be a straightforward expression of dorothy's feelings.
2. **tone**: the tone of the statement is serious and direct, indicating genuine concern or upset rather than sarcasm.
3. **context**: there is no indication of a previous statement or question that would suggest a sarcastic response. the statement stands alone as a direct expression of emotion.
4. **language style**: the language used is informal and conversational, but it does not exhibit the exaggerated or humorous elements typically associated with sarcasm.
5. **rhetorical devices**: while the phrase ""crocodin turbs"" might be a neologism, it does not inherently suggest sarcasm. the statement lacks other rhetorical devices that might indicate a sarcastic tone.

the provided cues offer some helpful context and analysis, but they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while the language style and content suggest potential for sarcasm or humor, especially with the absurd claim about ""someone else's subconscious,"" we don't have enough information about the tone, delivery, or broader context to confidently determine if the statement is genuinely sarcastic or just humorously evasive. more context about the situation, the speaker's typical manner of speech, and the reaction of other characters would be needed to make a clear determination about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:rhetorical devices
no

the provided cues offer valuable context and analysis, but they are not entirely sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while the rhetorical device of hyperbole is identified, which can be associated with sarcasm, the overall tone and intent remain somewhat ambiguous without additional context or delivery cues (like tone of voice or facial expressions). the statement could be interpreted as a genuine, if humorously exaggerated, apology or as a sarcastic comment, depending on the broader context and delivery. therefore, more information would be needed to confidently determine sarcastic polarity.
next_cue_response:punctuation
no

while the provided cues offer valuable insights into the text's content, tone, and style, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity. the cues provide good context and analysis, but sarcasm often relies heavily on additional factors such as delivery, broader context, and the speaker's typical manner of speech. without more information about chandler's character or the full context of the conversation, it's challenging to determine with certainty whether this statement is genuinely apologetic or sarcastic.

the provided cues offer some useful context and analysis, but they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while we have information about the emotional words, language style, and rhetorical devices used, sarcasm often relies heavily on tone, delivery, and broader context that may not be fully captured in these cues. the statement could be genuinely apologetic or sarcastically insincere, and without additional context or cues about chandler's typical speech patterns or the situation he's referencing, it's difficult to determine the sarcastic polarity with high confidence.

no
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts

label:
based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **humor and wordplay**: the description of the chicken as ""extra flat and crispy"" is unusual and humorous, suggesting a playful tone rather than a serious one.
2. **absurdity**: the idea of chicken being ""extra flat"" is absurd and not a typical way to describe food, indicating that the statement is not meant to be taken literally.
3. **contextual clues**: the informal and conversational style, combined with the playful description, suggests that dorothy is not making a genuine offer but rather making a humorous or sarcastic comment.
4. **emotional contrast**: while the text does not provide explicit emotional contrasts, the light-hearted and casual tone contrasts with the absurdity of the description, further indicating sarcasm.

given these points, the statement by dorothy is likely meant to be sarcastic.",1.0

howard: right, right, whereas jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

steps:
yes.

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

label:
sarcastic

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

the statement ""dorothy: it's a musical rose"" does not contain any clear indicators of sarcasm. the language is straightforward and lacks the contrast or irony typically associated with sarcastic remarks. dorothy is simply informing rose that ""it"" is a musical, and there is no evident emotional contrast or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm.",0.0

based on the cues provided, the text does not exhibit clear signs of sarcasm. the language style is conversational and informal, and the concern expressed by dorothy appears to be genuine rather than sarcastic. the use of cultural references (michael jackson and the elephant man) serves to emphasize her worry rather than to mock or convey irony.

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

this line appears to be a sarcastic response from dorothy to rose. the context suggests that rose likely asked a question about where something occurred, and dorothy's reply is a sarcastic retort implying that the answer should have been obvious. the mention of a ""pie eating contest"" is likely not meant literally, but rather used sarcastically to emphasize the absurdity of rose's implied question or statement. the tone and structure of the response, along with the context provided about it being dialogue from a likely comedic source, strongly indicate that this is a sarcastic comment.","### response:

while there is some uncertainty without the full context, these cues provide enough information to reasonably detect the sarcastic tone of the statement. the contrast between the described ""casual, la-di-da approach"" and the implied reality of jewish mothers being very invested in their sons' lives strongly suggests sarcasm. this aligns with common stereotypes about jewish mothers being overly involved, which further supports interpreting the statement as sarcastic.

this statement is clearly sarcastic. howard is using irony to make a point about jewish mothers, who are stereotypically known for being very involved and protective of their children, especially their sons. by describing their approach as ""casual"" and ""la-di-da"" (which means carefree or nonchalant), howard is saying the exact opposite of what is commonly understood about jewish mothers' parenting style. this stark contrast between the statement and the widely held perception creates the sarcasm.","### response:

while the emotional words provide some context, they are not sufficient on their own to definitively determine sarcastic polarity in this case. the statement could be genuinely apologetic or sarcastic depending on the broader context, tone, and delivery, which are not fully captured by just these emotional cues. additional information or context would be needed to make a more confident assessment of sarcasm.

the provided cues offer valuable context and analysis, but they are not entirely sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. while the rhetorical device of hyperbole is identified, which can be associated with sarcasm, the overall tone and intent remain somewhat ambiguous without additional context or delivery cues (like tone of voice or facial expressions). the statement could be interpreted as a genuine, if humorously exaggerated, apology or as a sarcastic comment, depending on the broader context and delivery. therefore, more information would be needed to confidently determine sarcastic polarity.

based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **absurdity and hyperbole**: the statement ""i just give up every tuesday of my life to help these screwups for the good of my health"" is an exaggerated claim that is unlikely to be taken literally. the idea that the moderator is sacrificing their time for their own health is clearly hyperbolic and absurd.
2. **language style**: the informal and conversational tone, combined with the use of the term ""screwups,"" suggests a sarcastic and dismissive attitude.
3. **contrast**: there is a stark contrast between the supposed altruistic action of giving up tuesdays and the derogatory term ""screwups,"" which indicates a sarcastic undertone.
4. **context**: the context provided indicates that the moderator is being sarcastic about their role and the people they are helping, implying that they do not genuinely believe they are doing it for their own well-being.

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### label:

### reasoning:
1. **allusion**: the phrase ""the british are coming?"" alludes to a famous historical event, which is often used in a dramatic or exaggerated context.
2. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, typical of chandler's character in the sitcom ""friends,"" often includes sarcasm.
3. **context**: chandler's character is known for his sarcastic humor. the use of a dramatic historical reference in a mundane or humorous context is a common sarcastic technique.
4. **punctuation**: the question mark at the end suggests a questioning or incredulous tone, which can be indicative of sarcasm.
5. **emotional contrasts**: while the text does not provide explicit emotional contrasts, the use of a dramatic historical reference in a likely non-serious context suggests a sarcastic tone.

label:
based on the analysis of the cues provided and the input text, i believe the correct label for this text is:

sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement contains an absurd claim (""it was someone else's subconscious"") which is a clear use of hyperbole for comedic effect.
2. the language style is described as informal and conversational, with an element of comedy, typical of sitcom dialogue.
3. chandler, the speaker, is employing humor to deflect responsibility, which is a common sarcastic technique.
4. the contrast between the apology and the ridiculous excuse highlights the sarcastic tone.
5. the use of ""someone else's subconscious"" as an excuse is so outlandish that it can't be taken seriously, indicating sarcasm.

while the apology starts sincerely, the addition of the impossible excuse about someone else's subconscious turns the entire statement into a sarcastic comment, likely meant to be humorous in the context of a sitcom or comedy show.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **absurdity and hyperbole**: the statement ""i was making a coconut phone with a professor"" is inherently absurd and exaggerated. the idea of making a phone out of a coconut is ridiculous, and the involvement of a professor in such a task adds to the hyperbolic nature of the statement.
2. **humor and informal style**: the language style is informal and conversational, typical of chandler's character in the sitcom ""friends,"" known for his sarcastic and humorous remarks.
3. **contrast and emotional effect**: the contrast between the mundane activity (making a phone) and the unexpected involvement of a professor creates a humorous and surprising emotional effect, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.
4. **character context**: knowing chandler's character, who often uses sarcasm and humor to deflect or make light of situations, supports the interpretation of this statement as sarcastic.

given these points, the statement is best understood as sarcastic, intended to be humorous and not to be taken literally.",1.0

steps:
yes

i can provide this answer with a high degree of confidence (at least 60% certain). the cues given provide strong indicators of sarcasm in sheldon's statement:

1. the contrast between encouragement and condescension clearly signals sarcastic intent.
2. the juxtaposition of ""advanced"" thinking with an implied primitive belief (flat earth) is a classic sarcastic technique.
3. the overall tone described, where sheldon's apparent praise is actually mocking, is a hallmark of sarcasm.

these cues, taken together, provide sufficient information to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text.

label:
based on the current cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the text displays clear sarcastic elements, as highlighted in the cues. sheldon's statement is a prime example of sarcasm, where he's using seemingly positive words (""encouraged"", ""advanced"") to actually convey a condescending and mocking attitude towards his mother's group. the implication that they previously believed in a flat earth further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, creating a stark contrast between supposed advancement and implied primitive beliefs.","### response:

chandler's statement, ""what do you know? it's a treat for the eyes and the ears,"" is likely sarcastic. the phrase ""what do you know?"" often precedes a sarcastic remark, and the exaggerated praise ""a treat for the eyes and the ears"" suggests that chandler is not genuinely impressed but rather mocking the situation. the cues provided, including chandler's tendency to use sarcasm, support this interpretation.",1.0
