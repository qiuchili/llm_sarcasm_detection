steps:
yes

while there is some room for uncertainty, i believe these cues are likely sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in this text. the juxtaposition of serious topics like misogyny with casual language like ""cat fight,"" along with the implied contrast between right and left reactions, strongly suggests sarcastic intent. however, without full context, there remains a degree of ambiguity, which is why i'm not 100% certain.

based on the provided context and the content of the input text, i would classify this as:

label: sarcastic

the text appears to be using sarcasm to comment on the perceived double standard in how discussions about misogyny are handled when involving women from different political alignments. the use of phrases like ""cat fight"" and ""imagine pulling that on the left"" suggest a mocking tone towards the situation, implying that such characterizations would be considered unacceptable if applied to left-wing women. the sarcasm is employed to highlight this perceived inconsistency in treatment.","### response:

sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **tone and language style**: the use of all caps in the hashtag ""#not gonna win"" suggests an emphatic tone, which is often used in sarcasm to exaggerate a point.
2. **context and emotional words**: the phrase ""not gonna win"" carries a strong negative sentiment. in the context of social media, such a statement is often used sarcastically to express frustration or disbelief, especially when the outcome is still uncertain.
3. **punctuation and hashtag**: the hashtag itself can be a marker of sarcasm, as it is used to draw attention to the statement in a dramatic way.
4. **lack of additional context**: while the url might provide more context, the standalone text already suggests a sarcastic tone due to its emphatic and negative nature.

given these cues, the text appears to be sarcastic, likely expressing doubt or frustration in a hyperbolic manner.",1.0

1. **emotional contrast**: the text contrasts a neutral description (""he is exactly that sort of person"") with a negative judgment (""weirdo!""), which can indicate sarcasm.
2. **rhetorical device**: the use of the epithet ""weirdo!"" adds a dismissive and exclamatory tone, often used in sarcastic remarks.

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""people who tell people with anxiety to 'just stop worrying about it' are my favorite kind of people #not #educateyourself"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of the phrase ""my favorite kind of people"" in conjunction with the hashtags #not and #educateyourself indicates that the author is being ironic and actually finds such advice unhelpful and dismissive.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

the given text is indeed sarcastic. the user is expressing a strong dislike for ""context and large ensemble fridays"" by sarcastically stating that they ""love"" them. the use of exaggerated punctuation (""!!!!!""), hashtags (#sarcasm, #getthefuckout), and the informal, expressive language style all contribute to the sarcastic tone.

reasoning:
1. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" is a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance with the social media platform.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or unexpected twist that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the sentiment aligns with common opinions about social media platforms sometimes being frustrating.
4. the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of hidden meaning or contradiction that are typical of sarcastic statements.
5. the use of ""so"" as an intensifier emphasizes the genuine feeling of annoyance rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of irritation with twitter, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:

1. **excitement and anticipation**: the text conveys genuine excitement and anticipation with phrases like ""oh boy..."" and ""warm up the dj booth.""
2. **direct address**: the use of direct address (""@masongoodman in the house"") and social media handles suggests a straightforward announcement rather than sarcasm.

4. **lack of sarcastic markers**: there are no clear markers of sarcasm such as irony, exaggeration, or contradiction in the text.

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text. the contrasting concepts of ""divide"" and ""unite"" paired with the exclamation ""what an irony!"" strongly suggest sarcasm. the hashtags further reinforce the controversial topics being addressed sarcastically. this combination of elements provides a reasonably clear indication of sarcastic intent, even if not 100% certain.

given the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement uses irony explicitly and juxtaposes contrasting concepts (divide vs. unite) in an unexpected way, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. the exclamation marks and the use of hashtags further emphasize the sardonic tone of the message. the speaker is using sarcasm to critique a perceived societal contradiction, making this a clear example of sarcastic expression.","### response:

reasoning:
1. the tone of the message is sincere and positive. the author expresses genuine interest in the other person's reading achievement and shows determination to improve their own.

2. the use of words like ""interesting"" and ""surely"" indicate a positive and earnest attitude.

3. there's no apparent irony or contradiction in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.

4. the author is openly admitting to reading fewer books (17) and expressing a desire to improve, which is a straightforward and honest sentiment.

5. the use of the hashtag #2015 suggests a genuine intention to set a goal for the coming year.

6. the informal language and twitter-style writing are consistent with a casual, friendly exchange rather than a sarcastic comment.

### reasoning:
1. **tone and context**: the statement suggests an exaggerated and impractical rule, which is a common indicator of sarcasm. the idea that one should stay up all night just because something is open all night is not a serious suggestion.

2. **irony**: there is a clear irony in the statement. the literal interpretation of the rule is impractical and humorous, which suggests that the speaker is not being serious.

3. **language style**: the use of ""i think the general rule is"" followed by an exaggerated statement is a common way to introduce a sarcastic comment.

4. **contextual understanding**: in the context of social media, such statements are often made in a tongue-in-cheek manner to entertain or make a point humorously.

therefore, the tweet appears to be a sarcastic comment rather than a genuine suggestion.",1.0

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

the statement ""being a hipster now is so mainstream. oh, the irony. #hipster #irony"" contains clear indicators of sarcasm. the use of the word ""irony"" and the hashtags ""#hipster"" and ""#irony"" emphasize the contradiction between the original concept of being a hipster (which is often associated with non-mainstream, alternative culture) and the current state of it being mainstream. this contradiction is a classic setup for sarcasm.

sarcastic

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### current cues:

### response:
the statement ""well got the truck buried today perfect way to start a rainy wednesday work day off #not #annoyed #pissed"" is likely meant sarcastically. the use of ""perfect way"" in a clearly negative situation, combined with the hashtags ""#not #annoyed #pissed,"" indicates that the speaker is being ironic and expressing frustration rather than genuine positivity.

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, i believe the identified cue of sarcasm is likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in this text. the stark contrast between mccoist's actions (handing in notice and getting a pay rise) and the statement about having the club's best interests at heart creates a clear sarcastic tone. this single cue provides a strong indication of the overall sarcastic intent, even if there's a small possibility of misinterpretation.

label:
based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""he really has rangers best interests at heart"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. this sarcasm is evident when contrasted with the actions described in the first part of the sentence - mccoist handing in his notice and getting a pay rise. these actions typically do not align with having the club's best interests at heart, making the final statement ironic and sarcastic in nature.","### response:

the statement ""i'm so at home!"" is clearly sarcastic when contrasted with the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#stickoutlikeasorethumb,"" which indicate that the person actually feels out of place among the posh people on the train. the use of sarcasm is evident in the stark contrast between the literal meaning of the statement and the true sentiment expressed through the hashtags.",1.0

next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### current cues:
the language style in the given text is informal and conversational, featuring casual expressions and the use of hashtags. it also includes a touch of humor or sarcasm, as indicated by the use of the word ""irony.""

### input:
stupid #doctors visits is gonna bury me!! now that's #irony

### response:
the text uses informal language and hashtags, which is typical of social media posts. the phrase ""stupid #doctors visits is gonna bury me!!"" expresses frustration, and the exclamation marks emphasize the intensity of this feeling. the use of ""now that's #irony"" suggests that the speaker finds it ironic that something meant to help (doctor visits) is causing them significant distress or trouble.

while there is some room for uncertainty, i believe these cues are likely sufficient to detect sarcastic polarity in this text. the juxtaposition of serious topics like misogyny with casual language like ""cat fight,"" along with the implied contrast between right and left reactions, strongly suggests sarcastic intent. however, without full context, there remains a degree of ambiguity, which is why i'm not 100% certain.

the text appears to be using sarcasm to comment on the perceived double standard in how discussions about misogyny are handled when involving women from different political alignments. the use of phrases like ""cat fight"" and ""imagine pulling that on the left"" suggest a mocking tone towards the situation, implying that such characterizations would be considered unacceptable if applied to left-wing women. the sarcasm is employed to highlight this perceived inconsistency in treatment.","### response:

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text ""planning a vacation instead of studying.... my priorities are in line. #not"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""my priorities are in line"" followed by the hashtag ""#not"" indicates that the speaker is aware that their priorities are not actually in line and is using sarcasm to highlight this.

### reasoning:
1. **language style**: the text is informal and conversational, featuring casual expressions like ""lol"" and hashtags such as ""#socute"" and ""#3moreweeks."" this suggests a light-hearted and genuine tone rather than sarcasm.
2. **context**: the speaker finds dan's gesture of having a sign at the airport cute and endearing. the use of ""lol"" and ""#socute"" indicates that the speaker is amused and genuinely finds the gesture charming.
3. **emotional words**: words like ""socute"" and the use of ""lol"" convey positive emotions and amusement, which are not typically associated with sarcasm.
4. **common knowledge**: the context of someone making a sign for another person at the airport is generally seen as a sweet and thoughtful gesture, not something that would typically be mocked or treated sarcastically.

given these points, the text appears to be a sincere expression of amusement and affection, rather than sarcasm. therefore, the label ""not sarcastic"" is appropriate.",0.0

the statement ""he really has rangers best interests at heart"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. this sarcasm is evident when contrasted with the actions described in the first part of the sentence - mccoist handing in his notice and getting a pay rise. these actions typically do not align with having the club's best interests at heart, making the final statement ironic and sarcastic in nature.","### current cues:

while there is some uncertainty, i believe the identified cue of sarcasm is likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in this text. the stark contrast between mccoist's actions (handing in notice and getting a pay rise) and the statement about having the club's best interests at heart creates a clear sarcastic tone. this single cue provides a strong indication of the overall sarcastic intent, even if there's a small possibility of misinterpretation.

4. the word ""dummy"" could be seen as mildly insulting, but its use here doesn't seem to indicate sarcasm.

while the context is limited, the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit fragmented, communication on a social media platform.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **promotional nature**: the text is clearly promotional, aiming to inform the audience about an extended cut of a film titled ""nicha.""
2. **hashtags**: the use of hashtags like #trailer, #spoof, #film, #dramatic, #action, #film2014, #youtube, and #fightscenes is typical for categorizing content on social media and attracting viewers interested in those topics.
3. **lack of sarcastic markers**: there are no indicators of sarcasm such as irony, exaggeration, or incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning.
4. **direct language**: the language is straightforward and direct, focusing on providing information rather than conveying a sarcastic tone.

given these points, the text does not exhibit characteristics of sarcasm and is best labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

the tweet is indeed sarcastic. the user is mocking the idea of the ""trickle-down"" effect, which suggests that benefits provided to businesses will eventually benefit everyone. the use of ""#not"" at the end of the tweet clearly indicates the user's skepticism and disbelief in this concept. the mention of the ""trickle down fairy"" adds a whimsical and mocking tone, further reinforcing the sarcastic nature of the comment.

1. **rhetorical question**: the use of a rhetorical question (""can you not understand that not everything is about the president?"") is often a marker of sarcasm, as it implies that the answer should be obvious and that the speaker is frustrated with the other person's inability to see it.
2. **emotional word**: the word ""understand"" in this context carries an emotional weight, suggesting frustration or exasperation.
3. **context**: the text is a response to a discussion or argument, which often heightens the likelihood of sarcasm, especially when addressing multiple users on a social media platform.
4. **emphasis**: the capitalization of ""everything"" adds emphasis, which can be a sign of sarcasm, indicating that the speaker finds the idea being refuted to be absurd.

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### response:

the statement ""when you're in the doctors waiting room and hear a baby in the back screaming her lungs out is always a reassuring feeling #not"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""#not"" at the end of the sentence explicitly indicates that the speaker means the opposite of what they are saying. instead of finding the situation reassuring, they find it unsettling or annoying.

reasoning:
1. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" is a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance with the social media platform.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or unexpected twist that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the sentiment aligns with common opinions about social media platforms sometimes being frustrating.
4. the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of hidden meaning or contradiction that are typical of sarcastic statements.
5. the use of ""so"" as an intensifier emphasizes the genuine feeling of annoyance rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of irritation with twitter, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:

### reasoning:
1. **positive emotions**: the text expresses positive emotions such as happiness and love, which are not typically associated with sarcasm.
2. **affectionate language**: phrases like ""happy birthday,"" ""love you,"" and ""legend"" are sincere and affectionate, indicating genuine admiration and celebration.
3. **context**: the context of a birthday greeting is generally straightforward and sincere, aiming to convey good wishes and positive sentiments.

5. **hashtags**: the hashtags #phillies and #legend further support the genuine admiration and respect for the person being addressed.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### label:

2. **hashtags**: the use of multiple hashtags, especially ones that seem to mock the importance of the topic (#new #shirt #im #sorry), can be a sign of sarcasm.
3. **context**: the context of the statement, which is about a new shirt, is generally not something that would elicit a strong negative reaction, making the exaggerated disinterest more likely to be sarcastic.

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, casual statement about spending time with a dog. the informal language, use of slang, and inclusion of a hashtag and image link are typical of sincere social media posts. there's no apparent irony, contradiction, or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems genuinely relaxed and positive, consistent with someone casually sharing a moment with their pet.","### response:

the text ""wow...lol"" suggests a tone of disbelief or mockery, which is a strong indicator of sarcasm. the use of ""lol"" (laughing out loud) after ""wow"" implies that the statement is not meant to be taken seriously. additionally, the hashtags ""#not"" and the repetition of it further suggest a sarcastic tone, as if dismissing the legitimacy of the work-from-home opportunities mentioned. the overall informal and mocking tone, combined with the rhetorical question and the use of hashtags, points towards sarcasm.",1.0

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues are not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this short text. the title phrased as a question and the link to a forbes article don't provide enough context to determine if sarcasm is present. more content from the actual article or surrounding discussion would be needed to make that assessment with reasonable confidence.

my confidence in this judgment is about 70%. the given cues provide some context about the text being a headline or title for an article, but they don't offer enough specific information about sarcastic elements or tone to conclusively determine sarcastic polarity. without more details about the content or style of the full article, it's difficult to assess whether sarcasm is present or not.
next_cue_response:language style
no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question about obamacare's impact on health care spending, shared as a tweet with a link to a forbes article. without more context or content from the actual article, it's not possible to determine if there's any sarcastic intent behind the question.

my reasoning is that while the provided cues offer some useful context about the text's structure and topic, they do not provide sufficient information to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the cues mainly describe the format and content of what appears to be a tweet sharing an article headline, but don't give insight into potential sarcastic intent or tone. without more information about the article's content or the poster's typical communication style, it's not possible to make a confident determination about sarcasm based solely on these cues.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward headline or title of an article, followed by a link to forbes.
2. it's phrased as a neutral question about a serious topic (healthcare spending).
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
4. the source (forbes) is a reputable business magazine, typically associated with factual reporting rather than sarcastic commentary.
5. the language is concise and direct, which is common for social media shares of news articles.

the text seems to be a genuine inquiry into the effects of obamacare on healthcare spending, likely leading to an informative article on the topic. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the phrase ""at least i don't have to clean the floor"" suggests a sense of relief or consolation, which can often be used sarcastically to downplay a worse situation.
2. **rhetorical device**: the use of consolation in this context can imply sarcasm, as it might be highlighting a minor positive in the face of a larger negative.
3. **emotional contrasts**: the relief expressed contrasts with an implied negative situation, which is a common feature of sarcastic statements.
4. **language style**: informal and conversational language can often be used to convey sarcasm.
5. **punctuation**: the use of an apostrophe and a period does not significantly affect the sarcastic tone but maintains the informal style.

given these cues, the statement likely carries a sarcastic undertone, implying that while not having to clean the floor is a small relief, there is a larger, more burdensome situation at play.",1.0

while these linguistic cues provide helpful context, they are not definitively sufficient to determine sarcastic polarity with high confidence. the informal style, hashtag use, and emojis could be consistent with either sincere or sarcastic intent in this case. more contextual information or clearer indicators of irony would be needed to make a confident judgment about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
yes

label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

2. the contrast between claiming to be ""strong"" while simultaneously begging for a drink (brew) with the hashtag and emojis suggests sarcasm.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – strength vs. desperation – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

given these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this text.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the phrase ""justice delayed is justice denied"" is a serious statement about the importance of timely justice, but its use in this context, related to a movie foreword by subroto roy sahara, suggests irony.
2. the hashtag #irony explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be taken sarcastically.
3. the use of ""incidentally"" at the beginning of the sentence adds a casual tone that contrasts with the serious nature of the statement, further suggesting sarcasm.
4. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – a serious statement about justice in a seemingly trivial context – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

3. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, characterized by the use of hashtags, abbreviations, and a rhetorical question, can be indicative of sarcasm, especially in social media contexts.
4. **punctuation and emphasis**: the use of multiple hashtags and punctuation marks (exclamation mark, question mark) adds to the sarcastic tone by emphasizing the speaker's disbelief or frustration.
5. **common knowledge**: the assertion that the usa is a republic, not a democracy, is a common point of contention in political discourse. the rhetorical question ""do you #know #what the #pledge of #allegiance say's?"" implies that the speaker believes the recipient should already know this, adding to the sarcastic tone.

I blame my mom. Mother of the Year #sarcasm,1,"input:
maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed in obtaining world peace?  #missworld2014

steps:
no

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""i blame my mom. mother of the year #sarcasm"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates that the statement is not meant to be taken literally. the phrase ""mother of the year"" is used ironically to suggest that the speaker's mother has done something that is the opposite of what a ""mother of the year"" would do.

steps:
no

while these linguistic cues provide helpful context, they are not definitively sufficient to determine sarcastic polarity with high confidence. the informal style, hashtag use, and emojis could be consistent with either sincere or sarcastic intent in this case. more contextual information or clearer indicators of irony would be needed to make a confident judgment about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
yes

label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

2. the contrast between claiming to be ""strong"" while simultaneously begging for a drink (brew) with the hashtag and emojis suggests sarcasm.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – strength vs. desperation – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

given these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this text.","### response:

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues are not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this short text. the title phrased as a question and the link to a forbes article don't provide enough context to determine if sarcasm is present. more content from the actual article or surrounding discussion would be needed to make that assessment with reasonable confidence.

my confidence in this judgment is about 70%. the given cues provide some context about the text being a headline or title for an article, but they don't offer enough specific information about sarcastic elements or tone to conclusively determine sarcastic polarity. without more details about the content or style of the full article, it's difficult to assess whether sarcasm is present or not.
next_cue_response:language style
no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question about obamacare's impact on health care spending, shared as a tweet with a link to a forbes article. without more context or content from the actual article, it's not possible to determine if there's any sarcastic intent behind the question.

4. the source (forbes) is a reputable business magazine, typically associated with factual reporting rather than sarcastic commentary.
5. the language is concise and direct, which is common for social media shares of news articles.

the text seems to be a genuine inquiry into the effects of obamacare on healthcare spending, likely leading to an informative article on the topic. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

### reasoning:
1. **language style**: the text is informal and conversational, typical of social media interactions.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the use of the phrase ""to be fair"" followed by a playful critique suggests a contrast that can be indicative of sarcasm.
3. **emotional words**: the inclusion of the emoticon "":p"" is often used to convey a joking or teasing tone, which can be associated with sarcasm.
4. **keywords**: the mention of a ""mandatory #sarcasm hashtag"" directly references sarcasm, indicating that the speaker is likely being sarcastic.
5. **punctuation**: the use of the emoticon adds a playful and sarcastic tone to the message.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:
the text ""so there used to be a crossfit place here.... #irony #pizzawins http://t.co/9bdkxt9gfj"" is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to highlight the contrast between a place dedicated to fitness (crossfit) and the implication that it has been replaced by something less healthy, likely a pizza place, as suggested by the hashtags #irony and #pizzawins.

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward social media post, likely from twitter, given the mention of ""140 limits"" and multiple twitter handles.
2. there's no evident contrast between literal and intended meaning, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
3. the language used is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or mockery.
4. the word ""dummy"" could be seen as mildly insulting, but its use here doesn't seem to indicate sarcasm.
5. the overall structure and content of the message appear to be informational rather than sarcastic.

while the context is limited, the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit fragmented, communication on a social media platform.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts the enjoyment or nostalgia of singing songs from ""once more with feeling"" with the potential distraction or frustration of having them stuck in one's head while at work.
2. **context**: the context of being at work and having songs stuck in one's head suggests a situation where the person might be feeling annoyed or distracted, which can be a setup for sarcasm.
3. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, along with the use of hashtags, adds a layer of personal expression that can often be sarcastic.
4. **rhetorical devices**: the use of the phrase ""stuck in my head"" is a colloquial expression that conveys the idea of a song being memorable or catchy, which can be considered a form of hyperbole to emphasize how persistently the song is remembered.
5. **emotional words**: words like ""feeling"" and ""stuck"" indicate an emotional state that can be exaggerated for sarcastic effect.
6. **common knowledge**: it is commonly known that having a song stuck in one's head can be both amusing and annoying, which can lead to sarcastic remarks.

given these points, the text likely carries a sarcastic tone, as it humorously highlights the inconvenience of having catchy songs stuck in one's head while trying to work.",1.0

the given text uses an informal and emphatic language style, with hashtags for emphasis (#not, #terrorists) and a mix of punctuation (exclamation mark, hyphen) to convey strong emotions. the tone is defensive and assertive, which can sometimes be indicative of sarcasm, especially when someone feels the need to clarify their stance strongly.

however, in this case, the statement appears to be a genuine expression of the speaker's feelings about being misunderstood or mischaracterized. the use of hashtags and the strong emotional tone suggest a sincere attempt to clarify their position rather than a sarcastic remark.

while i'm fairly confident this text is likely sincere rather than sarcastic, i don't believe the given cues alone provide enough context to definitively determine sarcastic polarity with less than 40% uncertainty. the brief description of the topic and content align with the text, but sarcasm can sometimes mimic sincere praise. without additional contextual cues about tone, setting, or the speaker's typical communication style, i can't rule out potential sarcasm with the required level of certainty.

based on the input text and the given context, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### current cues:
the text expresses a contrast between the literal meaning of ""awesome"" and the sarcastic tone indicating that spending the day in and out of the doctor was actually unpleasant.

### input:
spending the majority of my day in and out of the doctor has been awesome. #sarcasm

1. the text appears to be a straightforward social media post, likely from twitter, given the mention of ""140 limits"" and multiple twitter handles.
2. there's no evident contrast between literal and intended meaning, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
3. the language used is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or mockery.
4. the word ""dummy"" could be seen as mildly insulting, but its use here doesn't seem to indicate sarcasm.
5. the overall structure and content of the message appear to be informational rather than sarcastic.

while the context is limited, the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit fragmented, communication on a social media platform.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **hashtags**: the hashtags #sarcastic and #sarcasm directly indicate that the content is intended to be sarcastic.
2. **emojis**: the use of the smiling emoji 😁 can be seen as a playful or mocking tone, which often accompanies sarcasm.
3. **context**: the phrase ""this is definitely me!"" followed by a link suggests that the content being linked to is likely an exaggerated or humorous representation, which aligns with sarcastic intent.
4. **additional hashtags**: hashtags like #tease, #funny, and #lol further support the idea that the post is meant to be humorous and not taken literally.

given these cues, the text is clearly intended to be sarcastic.",1.0

no

while these linguistic cues provide helpful context, they are not definitively sufficient to determine sarcastic polarity with high confidence. the informal style, hashtag use, and emojis could be consistent with either sincere or sarcastic intent in this case. more contextual information or clearer indicators of irony would be needed to make a confident judgment about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
yes

label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

2. the contrast between claiming to be ""strong"" while simultaneously begging for a drink (brew) with the hashtag and emojis suggests sarcasm.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – strength vs. desperation – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

given these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this text.","### response:
the text ""christmas alone😊 how nice #not"" contrasts the initial positive sentiment suggested by the smiley face with the negative sentiment indicated by the hashtag ""#not.""

while there is some uncertainty without more context, the cues provided are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic tone in this statement. the contrast between wanting to ""look super cute"" and the mundane situation of repair workers visiting suggests sarcasm, especially given the topic description. however, there's still a degree of ambiguity without more context or tone indicators, which is why i'm not 100% certain but am confident enough to say ""yes"" within the allowed 40% uncertainty margin.

label:
based on the input text and the given context, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### response:

based on the current cues, the text expresses mixed emotions about working wednesday-sunday. the hashtags and emojis indicate a combination of enthusiasm (#yay), reluctance (#not), and a focus on the financial benefit (#moneytho). the negative emojis (😩😭😒) further emphasize the frustration or reluctance.

while there is some uncertainty, i believe the identified cue of sarcasm is likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in this text. the stark contrast between mccoist's actions (handing in notice and getting a pay rise) and the statement about having the club's best interests at heart creates a clear sarcastic tone. this single cue provides a strong indication of the overall sarcastic intent, even if there's a small possibility of misinterpretation.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""yay for fire alarms at 3am #not"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""yay"" typically expresses excitement or happiness, but in this context, it is followed by a situation that is generally undesirable (a fire alarm going off at 3 am). the hashtag ""#not"" further emphasizes the sarcasm by explicitly negating the initial expression of excitement.

steps:
no

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### current cues:
the language style in the given text is informal and conversational, featuring casual language, abbreviations, and a rhetorical question. it also includes a hashtag to emphasize the tone or theme, in this case, irony.

### input:
@surianibteabu if it got the attention of the smartass to comment that.. didnt it work anyway?? #irony

### response:
the text uses a rhetorical question and the hashtag #irony to emphasize a sarcastic tone. the term ""smartass"" is a derogatory term often used sarcastically to describe someone who is being overly critical or pedantic. the rhetorical question ""didnt it work anyway??"" suggests that the speaker is mocking the idea that the comment was effective in some way, despite the criticism.

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty without more context, the cues provided are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic tone in this statement. the contrast between wanting to ""look super cute"" and the mundane situation of repair workers visiting suggests sarcasm, especially given the topic description. however, there's still a degree of ambiguity without more context or tone indicators, which is why i'm not 100% certain but am confident enough to say ""yes"" within the allowed 40% uncertainty margin.

label:
based on the input text and the given context, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### response:

reasoning:
1. the text is a straightforward expression of a desire to return to college.
2. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the use of hashtags (#feeling #this) appears to be genuine emphasis rather than mocking or sarcastic.
4. the ellipsis (..) at the end suggests a trailing thought or contemplation, which is consistent with a sincere expression of wanting to return to college.
5. the informal, brief style is typical of sincere social media posts rather than sarcastic commentary.

the text seems to be a genuine expression of the author's feelings about returning to college, without any discernible sarcastic intent.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts the passage of time (""two years later"") with the ongoing emotional response (""still makes me cry"") to the activity of gingerbread house making. this contrast can imply a sense of exaggeration or irony, which are common indicators of sarcasm.
2. **context**: the context of gingerbread house making, typically a joyful and festive activity, juxtaposed with the phrase ""still makes me cry"" suggests an unexpected and exaggerated emotional response, hinting at sarcasm.
3. **language style**: the informal and personal tone, combined with the phrase ""still makes me cry,"" adds a sense of ongoing struggle or frustration. this can be interpreted as a humorous exaggeration, a hallmark of sarcastic language.
4. **punctuation**: the use of the ampersand (&) and the period (.) contributes to the conversational and informal tone, which can be used to convey sarcasm in a casual manner.
5. **keywords**: the phrase ""still makes me cry"" is key here. in the context of gingerbread house making, it is likely an exaggeration meant to be humorous rather than a literal expression of sadness.

given these points, the text appears to be a sarcastic commentary on the emotional impact of making gingerbread houses, using exaggeration and irony to convey humor.",1.0

no

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""amar singh gives a+ rating to the modi govt but arun #shourie says more is said than done in present govt #irony #politics"" contains several cues that suggest sarcasm. the use of the hashtag #irony directly indicates a sarcastic tone. additionally, the contrast between amar singh's positive rating and arun shourie's critical comment implies a skeptical view of the modi government's performance. the context of politics and the use of irony further support the interpretation that the statement is sarcastic.

no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question and a link to an article, without any clear indicators of sarcasm. the available information focuses on analyzing the structure, style, and content of the text, but does not provide specific cues that would help determine if the text is meant to be sarcastic or sincere.
next_cue_response:topic

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward headline or title of an article, followed by a link to forbes.
2. it's phrased as a neutral question about a serious topic (healthcare spending).
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
4. the source (forbes) is a reputable business magazine, typically associated with factual reporting rather than sarcastic commentary.
5. the language is concise and direct, which is common for social media shares of news articles.

the text seems to be a genuine inquiry into the effects of obamacare on healthcare spending, likely leading to an informative article on the topic. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the text criticizes the deployment of five police officers to manage speed cameras, suggesting it is excessive and unnecessary.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the use of hashtags like #waste #of #money and the emoji 😂 (laughing face) indicate a mocking and humorous tone.
3. **emotional words**: words like ""waste"" and the repeated use of hashtags emphasize the criticism.
4. **language style**: the text uses a conversational and exaggerated style, particularly with the phrase ""yes it takes 5 police officers!!"" which implies disbelief and sarcasm.
5. **keywords**: the hashtags and emojis are key indicators of sarcasm, as they add a layer of humor and criticism to the statement.
6. **punctuation**: the use of multiple exclamation marks and the structured hashtags contribute to the sarcastic tone.

given these cues, the text is clearly intended to be sarcastic, mocking the perceived overuse of police resources.",1.0

so ally mccoist hands his notice in and gets a pay rise,he really has rangers best interests at heart

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, i believe the identified cue of sarcasm is likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in this text. the stark contrast between mccoist's actions (handing in notice and getting a pay rise) and the statement about having the club's best interests at heart creates a clear sarcastic tone. this single cue provides a strong indication of the overall sarcastic intent, even if there's a small possibility of misinterpretation.

sarcastic

the statement ""he really has rangers best interests at heart"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. this sarcasm is evident when contrasted with the actions described in the first part of the sentence - mccoist handing in his notice and getting a pay rise. these actions typically do not align with having the club's best interests at heart, making the final statement ironic and sarcastic in nature.","### response:

sarcastic

the statement ""picked an excellent day to get my hair done 😒 #sarcasm"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates the sarcastic intent, and the emoji 😒 further emphasizes the dissatisfaction or irony in the statement. the phrase ""excellent day"" is used ironically to suggest that the day was actually not ideal for getting their hair done.",1.0

1. **context**: the person is describing a situation where they had poor sleep for two days but finally got good sleep last night. this context suggests a genuine expression of relief and happiness.

2. **emotional words**: the use of ""finally"" and the emoji 😁 indicate a positive emotional response, which aligns with genuine relief rather than sarcasm.

3. **language style**: the capitalization of ""finally"" emphasizes the relief and satisfaction of getting good sleep, which is a straightforward expression rather than an ironic or sarcastic one.

4. **punctuation**: the use of the emoji 😁 adds a visual cue that conveys happiness and relief, further supporting a non-sarcastic interpretation.

5. **hyperbole**: while the text uses hyperbole to emphasize the lack of sleep, it does not contradict the overall positive tone of finally getting good sleep. hyperbole here serves to highlight the extent of the sleep deprivation rather than to convey sarcasm.

based on these cues, the text appears to be a genuine expression of relief and happiness about finally getting good sleep, without any indicators of sarcasm.",0.0

the text seems to be a genuine expression of the author's feelings about returning to college, without any discernible sarcastic intent.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **punctuation and emphasis**: the use of ""*primal scream*"" and the exclamation mark (!) indicates a heightened emotional state, often associated with sarcasm.
2. **hyperbole**: the phrase ""*primal scream*"" is an exaggerated reaction, suggesting that the frustration might be overstated for effect, a common trait in sarcastic remarks.
3. **accusation and irony**: the accusation of ""re writing history"" implies a significant and controversial action, which can be seen as an ironic statement, especially in a political context.
4. **context and common knowledge**: the tweet is directed at a public figure (barack obama) and discusses a politically charged topic (cuba embargo), where sarcasm is often used to criticize or mock.
5. **language style**: the informal and expressive style, along with the use of hashtags and social media conventions, supports the interpretation of the tweet as sarcastic.

given these cues, the tweet appears to be a sarcastic expression of frustration towards barack obama's actions regarding the cuba embargo.",1.0

the text ""wow: look what the nfl rams player who did 'hands up, don't shoot' pose has been arrested for | http://t.co/fho7lcmvon via @po_st #ferguson"" contains several indicators of sarcasm:

1. **rhetorical devices**: the use of ""wow"" and ""look"" suggests a tone of surprise or disbelief, which can often be associated with sarcasm, especially when discussing a serious or controversial topic.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the contrast between the player's previous positive or supportive action (""hands up, don't shoot"" pose) and the negative event of being arrested creates a juxtaposition that can be interpreted as sarcastic.
3. **language style**: the informal and sensational language style, combined with the exclamatory expression, hints at a sarcastic undertone.
4. **context**: the reference to the ferguson protests and the use of the hashtag #ferguson add a layer of social and political context that can amplify the sarcastic tone.

next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

2. **ellipsis**: the use of an ellipsis at the end of the sentence can imply that there is more to the story or that the speaker is leaving something unsaid, often hinting at sarcasm or irony.
3. **informal and conversational style**: the informal and conversational style of the text can be a vehicle for sarcastic remarks, as it mimics casual speech where sarcasm is often used.
4. **emotional word ""casually""**: the word ""casually"" suggests a relaxed or nonchalant attitude, which can be ironic if the situation actually calls for more excitement or attention.

1. **context**: the text is discussing the #orionlaunch feed buffering, which is a specific event that can be frustrating.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the use of the word ""stressful"" in a context that is not typically associated with high stress (watching a feed) suggests an exaggeration.
3. **emotional words**: the word ""stressful"" is a strong emotional word that contrasts with the relatively minor inconvenience of buffering.
4. **language style**: the phrase ""am i the only one who finds it very stressful"" is often used sarcastically to imply that the situation is more universally annoying than just to the speaker.
5. **punctuation**: the use of ellipsis and an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence adds to the sarcastic tone, indicating frustration and exaggeration.

3. the language used is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or mockery.
4. the word ""dummy"" could be seen as mildly insulting, but its use here doesn't seem to indicate sarcasm.
5. the overall structure and content of the message appear to be informational rather than sarcastic.

1. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts the emotions of celebration and gratitude, highlighting the joy of christmas and appreciation for essential workers.
2. **context**: the message is a reminder to honor essential service workers during christmas.

5. **topic**: the topic is about expressing gratitude and appreciation, which is generally straightforward and sincere.
6. **punctuation**: the punctuation used (period, vertical bar, hashtag) does not suggest sarcasm.

the text appears to be using sarcasm to comment on the perceived double standard in how discussions about misogyny are handled when involving women from different political alignments. the use of phrases like ""cat fight"" and ""imagine pulling that on the left"" suggest a mocking tone towards the situation, implying that such characterizations would be considered unacceptable if applied to left-wing women. the sarcasm is employed to highlight this perceived inconsistency in treatment.","### response:

the text ""just ranted on and the moment i'm about to hit send, my ipod just died. #greatmorning #not"" contains clear indicators of sarcasm. the use of the hashtag ""#greatmorning"" followed by ""#not"" is a common sarcastic expression to indicate that the morning is, in fact, not great at all. the frustration of the ipod dying at a critical moment further supports the sarcastic tone.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

while these cues provide useful context, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this text. the statement could be genuinely sincere appreciation, or it could potentially be sarcastic, depending on the broader context and tone that isn't fully captured in these brief cues. without additional indicators of tone or contradictory information, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether sarcasm is present or not.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text ""everyone wants the truth but nobody wants to be honest... #irony"" is highlighting a contradiction in human behavior, which is a common theme in sarcastic remarks. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly points out the contradictory nature of the statement, which is a strong indicator of sarcasm.

### reasoning:
1. **context and content**: the text suggests a cynical view of the situation, implying that the shelling might be a deliberate tactic to influence election issues. this kind of statement often carries a sarcastic undertone, as it hints at manipulation and insincerity in political actions.
2. **language style**: the informal and conversational tone, combined with the prediction about future events, can be indicative of sarcasm, especially in the context of political commentary.
3. **rhetorical devices**: while not explicitly containing rhetorical devices, the statement's implication that such a serious event (shelling) could be used to manipulate election issues suggests irony.
4. **common knowledge**: it is commonly understood that elections and border conflicts are serious matters. the suggestion that one might be used to influence the other can be seen as a sarcastic critique of political strategies.
5. **punctuation and emotional words**: the use of contractions and the casual tone contribute to the sarcastic feel. the lack of explicit emotional words does not negate the possibility of sarcasm, as the overall context and implication carry the sarcastic tone.

given these points, the text appears to be sarcastic, as it subtly mocks the potential manipulation of serious events for political gain.",1.0

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

label:
based on the provided context and the use of the :unamused_face: emoji, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

while these cues provide useful context, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this text. the statement could be genuinely sincere appreciation, or it could potentially be sarcastic, depending on the broader context and tone that isn't fully captured in these brief cues. without additional indicators of tone or contradictory information, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether sarcasm is present or not.

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

the statement uses irony explicitly and juxtaposes contrasting concepts (divide vs. unite) in an unexpected way, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. the exclamation marks and the use of hashtags further emphasize the sardonic tone of the message. the speaker is using sarcasm to critique a perceived societal contradiction, making this a clear example of sarcastic expression.","### current cues:
the topic of the text is about a person contemplating what to ask for as gifts from their dad, who is still giving them ""santa's gifts"" for the last time before they turn 18.

### input:
my dad's still gonna get me santa's gifts since it's my last year before 18, but i really don't know what to ask for... #irony

### response:
the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" suggests that the speaker is aware of the ironic situation where they are almost an adult but still receiving ""santa's gifts."" the phrase ""i really don't know what to ask for..."" adds to the sense of irony, as it implies a certain level of detachment or bemusement about the situation.

### label:
sarcastic

the statement uses irony explicitly and highlights the contrast between the speaker's age and the tradition of receiving ""santa's gifts,"" which is typically associated with younger children. the hashtag ""#irony"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone of the message.",1.0

no

while these linguistic cues provide helpful context, they are not definitively sufficient to determine sarcastic polarity with high confidence. the informal style, hashtag use, and emojis could be consistent with either sincere or sarcastic intent in this case. more contextual information or clearer indicators of irony would be needed to make a confident judgment about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
yes

label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

2. the contrast between claiming to be ""strong"" while simultaneously begging for a drink (brew) with the hashtag and emojis suggests sarcasm.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – strength vs. desperation – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

given these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this text.","### response:

the text uses **sarcasm** as a rhetorical device, indicated by the hashtags #sarcasm and #notworthit. sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often to mock or convey contempt.

3. **call to action**: the suggestion to ""look up '4th trimester abortions'"" is likely intended to be ironic, as there is no such thing as a fourth trimester in pregnancy, indicating a sarcastic tone.
4. **context**: the use of ""actually"" at the beginning of the message often signals a correction or contradiction, which can be a setup for sarcasm.

sarcastic

the statement ""he really has rangers best interests at heart"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. this sarcasm is evident when contrasted with the actions described in the first part of the sentence - mccoist handing in his notice and getting a pay rise. these actions typically do not align with having the club's best interests at heart, making the final statement ironic and sarcastic in nature.","### response:

label:
based on the provided context and the use of the :unamused_face: emoji, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

the use of the phrase ""what a great way to start the day!!"" followed by ""#not"" and the angry face emoji 😠 clearly indicates sarcasm. the initial positive statement is immediately negated by ""#not"" and further emphasized by the angry emoji, which conveys frustration or anger. this combination strongly suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic about their day starting off poorly.",1.0

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **contrast between literal and intended meaning**: the statement ""easiest cl group with two rubbish teams"" suggests that the group should have been easy to win, but the reality is that the team only won one game, indicating a poor performance. this contrast is a key indicator of sarcasm.
2. **exaggeration and irony**: describing the group as the ""easiest"" and the other teams as ""rubbish"" exaggerates the expectation of winning easily, which is ironic given the actual poor performance.
3. **emotional tone**: the use of phrases like ""lucky last minute pen"" and hashtags ""#not good enough"" and ""#gutted"" convey frustration and disappointment, which can often accompany sarcastic remarks.
4. **context**: the context of sports, particularly football, often involves passionate and sarcastic commentary, especially when expectations are not met.

given these indicators, the text displays typical markers of sarcasm.",1.0

label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""no one up? okay cool #not"" exhibits clear signs of sarcasm. the use of ""#not"" at the end of the statement is a direct indicator of sarcasm, as it negates the preceding statement in a mocking or resigned tone. the phrase ""okay cool"" also adds to the sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is not actually okay with the situation.

2. **context**: the context of the statement, where the author mentions seeing a leaf blowing in the breeze, sets up a mundane and trivial scenario. the suggestion to yell at the leaf highlights the absurdity, reinforcing the sarcastic tone.

3. **tone and intent**: the overall tone of the message appears to be mocking or dismissive, suggesting that the action being proposed (yelling at a leaf) is ridiculous. this aligns with a sarcastic intent.

4. **lack of literal meaning**: the statement does not make sense if taken literally, as yelling at a leaf is an irrational action. this incongruity between the literal meaning and the intended message is a hallmark of sarcasm.

label:
based on the provided context and the content of the input text, i would classify this as:

label: sarcastic

the text appears to be using sarcasm to comment on the perceived double standard in how discussions about misogyny are handled when involving women from different political alignments. the use of phrases like ""cat fight"" and ""imagine pulling that on the left"" suggest a mocking tone towards the situation, implying that such characterizations would be considered unacceptable if applied to left-wing women. the sarcasm is employed to highlight this perceived inconsistency in treatment.","### response:

### reasoning:
the text ""if you've got the world on a string, you should give me some of that string, think of all the cool applications. #whatamidoing"" employs a playful and whimsical tone, which can often be a marker of sarcasm. the phrase ""got the world on a string"" suggests a highly advantageous position, and the request to ""give me some of that string"" implies a desire to share in that advantage. the hashtag ""#whatamidoing"" adds a layer of self-awareness and confusion, which can be interpreted as a sarcastic acknowledgment of the improbability or absurdity of the request. the informal and conversational language style, combined with the whimsical tone and the use of a hashtag, further supports the interpretation of sarcasm.",1.0

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts the typical excitement around christmas with a dismissive attitude, suggesting that people should ""get a grip"" and eat mopani worms instead. this contrast is a strong indicator of sarcasm.
2. **context**: the context of the message is a reaction to the excessive focus on christmas, which the speaker finds frustrating.
3. **language style**: the use of phrases like ""foh"" (an abbreviation for ""fuck outta here"") and ""get a grip"" indicates a dismissive and mocking tone.
4. **rhetorical devices**: the suggestion to eat mopani worms, which are not a typical holiday food, serves as a hyperbolic and ironic statement meant to mock the situation.
5. **emotional words**: words like ""foh"" and ""get a grip"" convey strong emotions, often associated with sarcasm.
6. **topic**: the topic of christmas, which is generally associated with positive emotions, is being treated with disdain, adding to the sarcastic tone.
7. **punctuation**: the use of exclamation marks emphasizes the speaker's frustration and adds to the sarcastic tone.
8. **common knowledge**: it is commonly known that christmas is a widely celebrated and anticipated holiday, making the suggestion to eat mopani worms instead an obvious sarcastic remark.

the combination of these cues strongly suggests that the text is sarcastic.",1.0

my response is ""no"" because the given cues do not provide sufficient information to confidently detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""twitter can be so annoying."" the statement could be a genuine expression of frustration or a sarcastic comment, and the current cues don't offer enough context or clear indicators of sarcasm to make a definitive judgment.

while the provided cues offer some context and analysis, they are not sufficient to confidently detect sarcastic polarity in this short text. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" could be a straightforward expression of frustration or a sarcastic comment, depending on the broader context, tone, and intent of the speaker. without additional information or more specific indicators of sarcasm, it's challenging to determine the sarcastic polarity with certainty.

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" is a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance with the social media platform.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or unexpected twist that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the sentiment aligns with common opinions about social media platforms sometimes being frustrating.
4. the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of hidden meaning or contradiction that are typical of sarcastic statements.
5. the use of ""so"" as an intensifier emphasizes the genuine feeling of annoyance rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of irritation with twitter, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, including abbreviations and internet slang, often accompanies sarcastic remarks in online communication.
2. **tone**: the use of ""lol"" (laugh out loud) at the end of the statement can indicate a humorous or mocking tone, which is a common feature of sarcasm.
3. **context**: the suggestion that @railwaysloth needs to ""get a wee bit more"" without specifying what, combined with the ""lol,"" implies that the speaker might be making a light-hearted or sarcastic comment about @railwaysloth's current state or behavior.
4. **emotional words**: the presence of ""lol"" suggests that the statement is not entirely serious and may be intended to be taken humorously or sarcastically.
5. **punctuation**: the use of the ""@"" symbol indicates a direct message to a specific user, which can often be a setup for a sarcastic remark in social media contexts.

given these cues, the statement ""@railwaysloth u do really need to get a wee bit more lol"" appears to be sarcastic, as it combines a seemingly critical suggestion with a humorous tone.",1.0

while there is some uncertainty, i believe the identified cue of sarcasm is likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in this text. the stark contrast between mccoist's actions (handing in notice and getting a pay rise) and the statement about having the club's best interests at heart creates a clear sarcastic tone. this single cue provides a strong indication of the overall sarcastic intent, even if there's a small possibility of misinterpretation.

label:
based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""he really has rangers best interests at heart"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. this sarcasm is evident when contrasted with the actions described in the first part of the sentence - mccoist handing in his notice and getting a pay rise. these actions typically do not align with having the club's best interests at heart, making the final statement ironic and sarcastic in nature.","### current cues:

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### current cues:

### reasoning:
1. **content and context**: the text is a social media post that includes hashtags related to bob ross and a tattoo, along with a request to retweet and links to external content. the primary purpose appears to be sharing and promoting content rather than making a sarcastic remark.

2. **language style**: the language style is informal and typical of social media posts, characterized by the use of hashtags, abbreviations, and internet slang. there is no indication of irony or contradiction in the language used.

3. **emotional tone**: the text does not contain explicit emotional words or contrasts. it is neutral and straightforward, focusing on sharing content rather than expressing an emotional or sarcastic sentiment.

4. **punctuation and keywords**: the punctuation and keywords used (hashtags, request to retweet) are consistent with a genuine social media post aimed at engagement rather than sarcasm.

5. **rhetorical devices**: the text does not contain any clear examples of rhetorical devices such as metaphors, similes, or hyperbole, which are often used to convey sarcasm.

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""i guess waking up every couple hours is cool |#not"" is clearly sarcastic. the phrase ""i guess waking up every couple hours is cool"" is immediately contradicted by the hashtag ""#not,"" which indicates that the speaker actually finds waking up every couple of hours undesirable. this use of contradiction is a common indicator of sarcasm.

### reasoning:
1. **punctuation**: the use of ""lol"" and ""xxx"" suggests a playful, possibly sarcastic tone.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts the sense of accomplishment (""#bedroom #decoration done"") with the triviality of the remaining task (""#upstairs just needs a hoover...""), which can imply a sarcastic undertone.
3. **emotional words**: the use of ""lol"" (laughing out loud) often indicates that the speaker finds something amusing or is not taking it seriously, which can be a marker of sarcasm.
4. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, combined with the use of hashtags and emojis, adds to the playful and potentially sarcastic tone.
5. **common knowledge**: the juxtaposition of mundane tasks with festive activities (christmas decorations) can be seen as humorous, adding to the sarcastic feel.

so ally mccoist hands his notice in and gets a pay rise,he really has rangers best interests at heart

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, i believe the identified cue of sarcasm is likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity in this text. the stark contrast between mccoist's actions (handing in notice and getting a pay rise) and the statement about having the club's best interests at heart creates a clear sarcastic tone. this single cue provides a strong indication of the overall sarcastic intent, even if there's a small possibility of misinterpretation.

label:
based on the provided cues and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""he really has rangers best interests at heart"" is clearly meant to be sarcastic. this sarcasm is evident when contrasted with the actions described in the first part of the sentence - mccoist handing in his notice and getting a pay rise. these actions typically do not align with having the club's best interests at heart, making the final statement ironic and sarcastic in nature.","### response:

sarcastic

the statement ""look good feel good!"" is typically positive and enthusiastic. however, the hashtags #not, #teamnosleep, and #cantopeneyes introduce a stark contrast, indicating that the speaker is actually feeling the opposite due to lack of sleep. this contrast creates a clear sarcastic tone, as the initial positive statement is undermined by the reality of the situation described by the hashtags.",1.0

while these cues provide useful context, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this text. the statement could be genuinely sincere appreciation, or it could potentially be sarcastic, depending on the broader context and tone that isn't fully captured in these brief cues. without additional indicators of tone or contradictory information, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether sarcasm is present or not.

my confidence in this judgment is about 70%. the given cues provide some context about the text being a headline or title for an article, but they don't offer enough specific information about sarcastic elements or tone to conclusively determine sarcastic polarity. without more details about the content or style of the full article, it's difficult to assess whether sarcasm is present or not.

no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question about obamacare's impact on health care spending, shared as a tweet with a link to a forbes article. without more context or content from the actual article, it's not possible to determine if there's any sarcastic intent behind the question.

2. it's phrased as a neutral question about a serious topic (healthcare spending).
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
4. the source (forbes) is a reputable business magazine, typically associated with factual reporting rather than sarcastic commentary.
5. the language is concise and direct, which is common for social media shares of news articles.

the text seems to be a genuine inquiry into the effects of obamacare on healthcare spending, likely leading to an informative article on the topic. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the phrase ""i may have had a 'few' empties to recycle"" suggests understatement, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the use of quotation marks around ""few"" implies that the actual number of empties is likely much higher, creating a contrast between the literal meaning and the implied meaning.
3. **emotional words**: the word ""few"" in quotation marks is used ironically to downplay the actual situation.
4. **language style**: the use of quotation marks around ""few"" and the recycling symbol (♻♻) adds a playful tone, which is often associated with sarcasm.
5. **keywords**: the term ""few"" in quotation marks is a key indicator of sarcasm, as it suggests the speaker is not being entirely truthful about the quantity.
6. **punctuation**: the quotation marks around ""few"" serve as a cue for sarcasm, indicating that the word should not be taken at face value.
7. **common knowledge**: it is commonly understood that people often use understatement to humorously downplay a situation, which is a form of sarcasm.

given these cues, the text is best classified as ""sarcastic.""",1.0

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

1. **promotional nature**: the text appears to be a promotional tweet, focusing on advertising content or services related to photography, photoshop, photos, art, and eye candy.
2. **use of hashtags and emojis**: the use of hashtags and emojis is typical of social media posts aimed at attracting attention and engaging with an audience, rather than indicating sarcasm.
3. **call to action**: the inclusion of a call to action to follow a link suggests a straightforward intent to promote or advertise, rather than to convey sarcasm.
4. **lack of irony or contrast**: there is no clear irony or contrast between what is said and what is meant, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
5. **informal and promotional language style**: the language style is informal and promotional, which aligns with the intent to advertise rather than to be sarcastic.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### current cues:
the language style of the given text is informal and concise, with a touch of irony indicated by the hashtag.

### input:
the song was 'don't cry for me argentina' #irony

### response:
the use of the hashtag #irony clearly indicates that the speaker is being ironic. the song title ""don't cry for me argentina"" is likely being referenced in a context where it is not appropriate or fitting, which adds to the ironic tone.

3. the use of hashtags (#feeling #this) appears to be genuine emphasis rather than mocking or sarcastic.

the text seems to be a genuine expression of the author's feelings about returning to college, without any discernible sarcastic intent.","### label:

### reasoning:
1. **rhetorical questions**: the use of rhetorical questions (""i wonder how many people who visit food banks have huge tvs or are drunks?"") often implies a sarcastic tone, as it suggests the speaker already has a preconceived notion and is not genuinely seeking an answer.
2. **skeptical viewpoint**: the text expresses skepticism about the financial priorities or lifestyle choices of people who visit food banks, which can be interpreted as a sarcastic critique.
3. **hashtags**: the hashtags (#freedomofspeech #foodbanks) may serve to frame the context of the statement in a way that aligns with broader social or political issues, often used sarcastically to emphasize a point.
4. **emotional contrast**: the text contrasts feelings of skepticism or judgment towards people who visit food banks with the notion of exercising ""freedom of speech,"" which can be seen as a sarcastic justification for making a controversial statement.

the text uses sarcasm to highlight the contrast between the expected cheerful mood of ""jingle bells"" and the less festive feeling created by playing it in a minor key. the hashtag ""#not"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, indicating that the speaker does not actually believe that the minor key version sets a festive mood.

while the provided cues offer some insight into the emotional contrast in the text, they are not sufficient to conclusively detect sarcastic polarity. the text could be genuinely expressing skepticism or employing sarcasm, but the current cues don't provide enough context or specific markers of sarcasm to make a definitive determination. additional information about the context, tone, or typical communication style of the speaker would be needed for a more accurate assessment of sarcastic intent.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text expresses frustration or disappointment about getting sick at an inconvenient time, indicated by the sad emoji and the sarcastic hashtag ""#not"".

3. there's no apparent irony or contradiction in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.

4. the author is openly admitting to reading fewer books (17) and expressing a desire to improve, which is a straightforward and honest sentiment.

5. the use of the hashtag #2015 suggests a genuine intention to set a goal for the coming year.

6. the informal language and twitter-style writing are consistent with a casual, friendly exchange rather than a sarcastic comment.

therefore, this tweet appears to be a genuine response expressing admiration, self-reflection, and determination, without any indicators of sarcasm.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **contrast and informal language**: the text contrasts the idea of change being a process with the misconception that it is a single event. the use of informal language (""dafuq you thinking"") adds a casual, conversational tone that can often be associated with sarcasm.

2. **emotional tone**: the shift from a calm, informative statement to a more abrupt, questioning, and slightly confrontational tone suggests a sarcastic undertone. the use of ""dafuq"" indicates frustration or disbelief, which is often a marker of sarcasm.

3. **rhetorical question**: the phrase ""dafuq you thinking"" is a rhetorical question that implies the speaker believes the other person should already understand that change is a process. this rhetorical device is commonly used in sarcastic statements to highlight the obviousness of the point being made.

4. **context and keywords**: the context of the statement and the keywords used suggest that the speaker is emphasizing a point that they believe should be obvious, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.

based on these cues, the text appears to be sarcastic, as it uses informal language, emotional contrast, and rhetorical devices to convey a point in a way that suggests the speaker is mocking or questioning the other person's understanding.",1.0

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

- **context**: the text is discussing the height of interviewers at the big bash league (bbl) season 04, suggesting that they might be the tallest interviewers ever, using hashtags like #talltowers and #sevenfoot to emphasize their height.
- **emotional contrasts**: the text humorously contrasts the height of the interviewers with the typical expectations, suggesting that the interviewers are exceptionally tall.

the use of the word ""seriously"" at the beginning of the sentence, combined with hyperbolic language (""the tallest on ground interviewers of all time"") and humorous hashtags (#talltowers, #sevenfoot), suggests a playful and exaggerated tone. this indicates that the statement is likely not meant to be taken literally and is instead a sarcastic comment on the height of the interviewers.

3. the use of hashtags and colloquial language is typical of sincere social media posts.
4. there's no clear irony or contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
5. the rhetorical question at the end (#yallknowthatsnotcoolright?) seems to genuinely seek agreement rather than express sarcasm.

while the statement is provocative and critical, it doesn't display the typical markers of sarcasm. it appears to be a direct expression of the author's opinion or observation, albeit in an informal and colloquial manner.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **contrasting elements**: the text juxtaposes humor (#funny) and adult content (#18+) with a negative reaction to accommodations (disgustinghotels). this contrast can be a marker of sarcasm.
2. **hashtags**: the use of hashtags like #not all men, which is often used sarcastically in social media contexts, suggests a sarcastic tone.
3. **informal language**: the casual and informal language style, combined with the hashtags, often indicates a sarcastic or ironic intent.
4. **contextual clues**: the mention of ""turn on aquabreeze"" and ""disgustinghotels"" in the same breath, along with the link, implies a sarcastic commentary on the quality of the accommodations.

given these cues, the text appears to be making a sarcastic remark about the quality of the accommodations, using humor and irony to convey dissatisfaction.",1.0

next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message about a smartphone app that can help raise money for a church. the use of capitalization, abbreviations, and multiple links is typical of social media marketing, especially on platforms like twitter with character limits. the exclamation point and emphasis on ""app pays you!"" convey enthusiasm rather than sarcasm. the direct addressing of specific users (@revarun @c_of_e) and the provision of multiple informational links also suggest this is a genuine attempt to share information about the app, not a sarcastic comment. therefore, based on the content and style of the message, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

### label:

### reasoning:
1. **informal and conversational tone**: the text uses casual language and abbreviations, which is typical of sincere, informal communication.
2. **rhetorical question**: the rhetorical question (""has anyone visualised the different colours and flavours of twitter streams?"") seems to genuinely seek input or provoke thought rather than express sarcasm.
3. **metaphor usage**: the metaphor (""kinda lipmus test"") is used to explain the concept in a relatable way, not to mock or convey irony.
4. **lack of clear irony**: there is no clear contrast between what is said and what is meant, which is a common indicator of sarcasm.
5. **emotional words**: the brief emotional word ""kinda"" does not carry a strong sarcastic tone.

:unamused_face: half of the testing group was very helpful today.

steps:
yes

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

label:
based on the provided context and the use of the :unamused_face: emoji, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### label:

next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""@darlamiles7 then later he snuggles up to the royals with giddy glee #irony"" uses informal and conversational language, and the hashtag #irony explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be taken ironically. the phrase ""snuggles up to the royals with giddy glee"" suggests an exaggerated and unlikely scenario, further supporting the sarcastic tone.

the text appears to be a genuine expression of admiration and inspiration after hearing justice ruth bader ginsburg speak. the language used is straightforward, positive, and lacks any indicators of sarcasm or irony. the emotional words ""incredible"" and ""inspiration"" are used sincerely to convey the author's positive experience. the tone and context align with a straightforward, appreciative comment about a respected public figure, without any hint of sarcasm or hidden meaning.","### response:

not sarcastic

the text appears to be a straightforward social media post or tweet that includes hashtags and links, likely promoting or discussing something related to ping pong and home decor. there are no indicators of sarcasm such as exaggerated praise, unexpected contrasts, or context that would suggest the speaker means the opposite of what they're saying. the language is typical of social media posts aiming to reach a broader audience or categorize content, and the request to ""please rt"" (retweet) is a common call to action. therefore, the text is best labeled as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

steps:
no

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues are not sufficient to reliably detect sarcasm in this short text. the title phrased as a question and the link to a forbes article don't provide enough context to determine if sarcasm is present. more content from the actual article or surrounding discussion would be needed to make that assessment with reasonable confidence.

my confidence in this judgment is about 70%. the given cues provide some context about the text being a headline or title for an article, but they don't offer enough specific information about sarcastic elements or tone to conclusively determine sarcastic polarity. without more details about the content or style of the full article, it's difficult to assess whether sarcasm is present or not.
next_cue_response:language style
no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question about obamacare's impact on health care spending, shared as a tweet with a link to a forbes article. without more context or content from the actual article, it's not possible to determine if there's any sarcastic intent behind the question.

my reasoning is that while the provided cues offer some useful context about the text's structure and topic, they do not provide sufficient information to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the cues mainly describe the format and content of what appears to be a tweet sharing an article headline, but don't give insight into potential sarcastic intent or tone. without more information about the article's content or the poster's typical communication style, it's not possible to make a confident determination about sarcasm based solely on these cues.
next_cue_response:common knowledge
no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question and a link to an article, without any clear indicators of sarcasm. the available information focuses on analyzing the structure, style, and content of the text, but does not provide specific cues that would help determine if the text is meant to be sarcastic or sincere.

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward headline or title of an article, followed by a link to forbes.
2. it's phrased as a neutral question about a serious topic (healthcare spending).
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
4. the source (forbes) is a reputable business magazine, typically associated with factual reporting rather than sarcastic commentary.
5. the language is concise and direct, which is common for social media shares of news articles.

the text seems to be a genuine inquiry into the effects of obamacare on healthcare spending, likely leading to an informative article on the topic. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **language style**: the use of strong language (""fucking"") and expressive hashtags (#not-happy) suggests a heightened emotional response, which can often be a sign of sarcasm.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the phrase ""just gave up"" implies a sense of betrayal or unexpected failure, which can be exaggerated for sarcastic effect.
3. **emotional words**: the strong negative emotion conveyed by ""fucking"" and ""not-happy"" indicates frustration, which can be a component of sarcastic expression.
4. **context**: the context of a car breaking down is a common scenario where people might use sarcasm to cope with their frustration.

given these cues, the text likely uses sarcasm to express the speaker's frustration and disappointment with their car breaking down. therefore, the label ""sarcastic"" is appropriate.",1.0

the text ""i like the feeling when people thinks they're 2 steps ahead of me... but the truth is they're miles and miles behind me ahahahaha |#sarcasm"" contains several indicators of sarcasm:

1. **punctuation**: the use of ellipsis (""..."") and the exaggerated laughter (""ahahahaha"") suggest a mocking tone.
2. **language style**: the phrase ""i like the feeling when people thinks they're 2 steps ahead of me... but the truth is they're miles and miles behind me"" implies a contrast between what people think and the speaker's actual opinion, which is a common feature of sarcasm.
3. **hashtag**: the use of the hashtag ""#sarcasm"" explicitly indicates that the statement is sarcastic.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""bm 'gives me' from 3 pm to 8 pm with my son today, that's fair huh? #not!"" contains several cues that suggest sarcasm:

1. **quotation marks**: the use of quotation marks around ""gives me"" implies that the speaker is questioning the fairness or generosity of the time allotted.
2. **rhetorical question**: the phrase ""that's fair huh?"" is a rhetorical question that implies the speaker does not actually believe the situation is fair.

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### current cues:

5. **keywords**: words like ""smiles,"" ""scowls,"" ""recognition,"" and ""ignorance"" are used in a way that implies a critique of societal behavior, which is often done sarcastically.
6. **common knowledge**: it is commonly understood that sarcasm is used to criticize or mock societal norms, and the text appears to be doing just that by highlighting the influence of money on various aspects of life.

not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the text describes a tense and potentially dangerous situation where someone realizes they are in another person's territory and is pleading not to be shot. this context suggests a serious and urgent scenario rather than a sarcastic one.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the shift from confusion and realization to sudden fear and desperation indicates genuine panic and distress, not sarcasm.
3. **emotional words**: phrases like ""didn't know,"" ""what are you doin-,"" and ""please don't shoot at me"" convey real fear and urgency.
4. **language style**: the informal and fragmented language, use of capital letters, and incomplete sentences further emphasize the panic and fear, which are not typical of sarcastic communication.
5. **punctuation**: the use of ellipses, hyphens, and exclamation marks adds to the sense of urgency and distress, reinforcing the serious tone of the text.

given these cues, the text appears to be a genuine plea in a dangerous situation rather than a sarcastic remark. therefore, the appropriate label is ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

1. **contradiction**: the statement ""hyper at 1am when i really should be getting rest"" presents a clear contradiction, which is a common indicator of sarcasm. the speaker acknowledges that they should be resting but are instead hyper.
2. **hashtag and emojis**: the use of the hashtag ""#ohwhale"" and the whale emojis 🐋🐳 add a humorous and resigned tone to the statement, suggesting that the speaker is not genuinely concerned about their lack of rest. the phrase ""oh whale"" is a playful twist on ""oh well,"" often used to indicate a nonchalant or sarcastic acceptance of a situation.

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""we were miles apart, but you found me, now we are close enough, still apart #irony"" contains several cues that suggest a sarcastic tone. the use of contrasting phrases like ""miles apart"" and ""close enough, still apart"" creates a sense of irony, which is explicitly highlighted by the hashtag #irony. this indicates that the author is likely using sarcasm to comment on the paradoxical nature of the situation.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

sarcastic

the statement uses irony explicitly and juxtaposes contrasting concepts (divide vs. unite) in an unexpected way, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. the exclamation marks and the use of hashtags further emphasize the sardonic tone of the message. the speaker is using sarcasm to critique a perceived societal contradiction, making this a clear example of sarcastic expression.","### response:

while there is some room for uncertainty, the cues provided offer strong indications of sarcasm:

1. the context of addressing a customer service team
2. the phrase ""continuing with"" implying an ongoing issue
3. the use of ""wonderful"" in a context that suggests the opposite

:unamused_face: half of the testing group was very helpful today.

steps:
yes

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

label:
based on the provided context and the use of the :unamused_face: emoji, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

the text reflects a mix of emotions: frustration or regret for setting the alarm incorrectly (""set my alarm for pm not am""), a sense of humor or sarcasm about the situation (""guess you could say i've got my life together #not sorry""), and possibly a sense of identity or pride (""@pe_tweetcher #pearlburg mom and jesus"").

### label:
sarcastic

the phrase ""guess you could say i've got my life together #not sorry"" is a clear indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying the opposite of having their life together, as evidenced by the mistake of setting the alarm for pm instead of am. the hashtag ""#not sorry"" further emphasizes the sarcastic tone.",1.0

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the comment ""gun nut yells at cops conducting dui checkpoint, later hit by drunk driver on way home #irony #karma"" is sarcastic. the use of terms like ""gun nut"" and hashtags such as ""#irony"" and ""#karma"" indicate a mocking tone. the commenter is highlighting the perceived poetic justice or irony in the situation where someone who was antagonistic towards police officers at a dui checkpoint ends up being hit by a drunk driver. the hashtags further emphasize the sarcastic nature by pointing out the supposed moral lesson or comeuppance in the event.

### reasoning:
1. **punctuation and hashtags**: the use of hashtags (#yoga, #merrychristmas) and the exclamation mark (!) suggest an attempt to draw attention and add emphasis, which can be indicative of a playful or sarcastic tone.
2. **pun and playful language**: the phrase ""down faced dog dinner"" is a pun on the yoga pose ""downward-facing dog,"" which adds a humorous twist. this kind of wordplay is often used in sarcastic or humorous contexts.
3. **context and common knowledge**: the combination of yoga (a typically calm and serene activity) with a festive greeting (merry christmas) and a dinner (which is not typically associated with yoga) creates a contrast that can be seen as humorous or sarcastic.
4. **social media style**: the informal and conversational style, along with the mention of a specific person (@ollielocke) and a link to additional content, is typical of social media posts that often use sarcasm or humor to engage the audience.

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the text is a social media interaction where one user, @restlessduncan, is addressing another user, @sr_duncan, and expressing relief or satisfaction that @sr_duncan understood their joke.
2. **emotional contrasts**: there is a subtle emotional contrast where @restlessduncan seems to express a sense of relief or satisfaction, which can imply that the joke might not have been well-received or understood by others.
3. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, along with the light-hearted tone, suggests a playful interaction, which is often a context where sarcasm is used.
4. **keywords**: the phrase ""at least you got my joke"" can imply that others did not get the joke, which can be a sarcastic way of highlighting that the joke might not have been very successful or obvious.
5. **common knowledge**: in social media interactions, especially when discussing jokes, sarcasm is a common element.

given these points, the text likely contains a sarcastic undertone, as the user is highlighting that their joke was understood, possibly implying that it was not universally appreciated or understood by others.",1.0

while i'm fairly confident this text is likely sincere rather than sarcastic, i don't believe the given cues alone provide enough context to definitively determine sarcastic polarity with less than 40% uncertainty. the brief description of the topic and content align with the text, but sarcasm can sometimes mimic sincere praise. without additional contextual cues about tone, setting, or the speaker's typical communication style, i can't rule out potential sarcasm with the required level of certainty.

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward observation or comment about perceived social behavior.
2. the tone is informal and critical, but not overtly sarcastic.
3. the use of hashtags and colloquial language is typical of sincere social media posts.
4. there's no clear irony or contrast between what's said and what's meant, which is often a hallmark of sarcasm.
5. the rhetorical question at the end (#yallknowthatsnotcoolright?) seems to genuinely seek agreement rather than express sarcasm.

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **hashtags**: the use of hashtags like #johnny #football #time #is #not #a #fun time #any #more suggests a mocking tone, especially when broken down into individual words.
2. **context**: the context provided indicates that the cleveland browns' game was not enjoyable, which aligns with the sarcastic tone of the hashtags.
3. **irony**: the phrase ""not a fun time anymore"" implies a contrast between past expectations of enjoyment and the current disappointing reality, a common feature of sarcasm.
4. **language style**: the fragmented hashtag style adds to the sarcastic tone, emphasizing each word in a way that suggests frustration or disappointment.

given these cues, the text appears to be sarcastic, expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of the cleveland browns and johnny manziel's performance.",1.0

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### label:

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts serious economic issues with the seemingly trivial mention of ""chocolate pudding,"" which is an unusual and whimsical element in the context of an election. this contrast can be a marker of sarcasm.

4. **rhetorical devices**: the juxtaposition of serious and trivial elements can be a rhetorical device used to convey sarcasm.

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### current cues:

### label:
not sarcastic

this text appears to be a genuine reflection on a funny and memorable event from the previous year. the use of informal language, slang, and hashtags suggests a casual and nostalgic tone rather than a sarcastic one. the hyperbolic expression ""hella funny"" emphasizes the humor of the memory, and the hashtag ""#khwaaaa"" encapsulates the sentiment in a relatable way. therefore, based on the content and style of the message, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

### reasoning:
1. **literal meaning**: the sentence ""hoar frost is challenging for some to spell."" is a straightforward statement about the difficulty some people have with spelling the term ""hoar frost.""
2. **language style**: the language used is clear and informative without any indication of irony or mockery.
3. **emotional words**: there are no emotional words or contrasts present in the text.
4. **rhetorical devices**: the text does not employ any rhetorical devices that would suggest sarcasm.
5. **context**: the context provided is purely informational and does not hint at any underlying sarcastic tone.

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

while the provided cues offer some insight into the emotional contrast in the text, they are not sufficient to conclusively detect sarcastic polarity. the text could be genuinely expressing skepticism or employing sarcasm, but the current cues don't provide enough context or specific markers of sarcasm to make a definitive determination. additional information about the context, tone, or typical communication style of the speaker would be needed for a more accurate assessment of sarcastic intent.

label: sarcastic

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text is clearly sarcastic. the speaker is expressing displeasure about vomiting early in the morning by ironically stating that it is ""exactly what i want to be doing."" the use of the hashtag ""#not"" and the sick face emojis further emphasize the sarcastic tone.

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty without more context, the cues provided are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic tone in this statement. the contrast between wanting to ""look super cute"" and the mundane situation of repair workers visiting suggests sarcasm, especially given the topic description. however, there's still a degree of ambiguity without more context or tone indicators, which is why i'm not 100% certain but am confident enough to say ""yes"" within the allowed 40% uncertainty margin.

label:
based on the input text and the given context, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### response:

the text contains several indicators of sarcasm:
1. **punctuation**: the use of ellipses (""...""), multiple periods (""..""), and the winking emoticon ("";)"") suggest a sarcastic tone.
2. **language style**: the phrase ""ahem... yeah.. something like that"" implies a dismissive or mocking tone.

while these linguistic cues provide helpful context, they are not definitively sufficient to determine sarcastic polarity with high confidence. the informal style, hashtag use, and emojis could be consistent with either sincere or sarcastic intent in this case. more contextual information or clearer indicators of irony would be needed to make a confident judgment about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
yes

label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

2. the contrast between claiming to be ""strong"" while simultaneously begging for a drink (brew) with the hashtag and emojis suggests sarcasm.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – strength vs. desperation – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

2. the use of ""for all the customers that are here!!!!!!"" with excessive exclamation marks suggests an exaggerated or ironic tone, indicating that there are no customers.
3. the hashtags ""#not"" and ""#itsdead"" further emphasize the sarcastic nature of the statement, as they directly contradict the initial claim of being ""glad.""

2. **contradiction**: the statement ""definitely not..."" followed by a definitive assertion about racism being systematic and entrenched creates a contradiction. this juxtaposition is a common marker of sarcasm, where the initial statement is meant to be understood in the opposite sense.

3. **context and content**: the tweet addresses a serious and complex social issue (systemic racism) in a manner that seems to undermine or mock the gravity of the topic. the casual and conversational language style, combined with the assertive tone, further supports the interpretation of sarcasm.

4. **rhetorical devices**: the use of assertion and parallelism in the phrase ""systematic and entrenched"" emphasizes the seriousness of the issue, but the initial ""definitely not..."" introduces a sarcastic twist, suggesting that the speaker is not genuinely denying the problem but rather highlighting its obviousness through irony.

not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message about a smartphone app that can help raise money for a church. the use of capitalization, abbreviations, and multiple links is typical of social media marketing, especially on platforms like twitter with character limits. the exclamation point and emphasis on ""app pays you!"" convey enthusiasm rather than sarcasm. the direct addressing of specific users (@revarun @c_of_e) and the provision of multiple informational links also suggest this is a genuine attempt to share information about the app, not a sarcastic comment. therefore, based on the content and style of the message, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### current cues:

1. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" is a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance with the social media platform.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or unexpected twist that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the sentiment aligns with common opinions about social media platforms sometimes being frustrating.
4. the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of hidden meaning or contradiction that are typical of sarcastic statements.
5. the use of ""so"" as an intensifier emphasizes the genuine feeling of annoyance rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of irritation with twitter, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **irony and exaggeration**: the statement contains clear elements of irony and exaggeration. it makes sweeping generalizations about wealthy, high-powered businesspeople being ""ugly,"" ""stupid,"" and needing to ""learn how to spell,"" which are unlikely to be sincere opinions.
2. **contradiction**: the negative descriptors contrast sharply with the typical perception of wealthy, high-powered individuals, suggesting a sarcastic tone.
3. **hashtag context**: the hashtag #sonyhack provides context that the statement is related to the sony email leaks, which were controversial and widely discussed. this context supports the interpretation that the statement is mocking or criticizing the content of the emails in a sarcastic manner.
4. **language style**: the use of parentheses ""(wo)men"" and the ampersand ""&"" contribute to a casual, mocking tone, further indicating sarcasm.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

3. the language used is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or mockery.

5. the overall structure and content of the message appear to be informational rather than sarcastic.

### reasoning:
1. **contrast in tone**: the text contrasts a casual, humorous tone with the underlying discomfort or reluctance associated with menstruation. this contrast is a common marker of sarcasm.
2. **playful excuse**: the phrase ""hey sorry im late i didnt want to come"" is a playful and exaggerated excuse, which is often used sarcastically to downplay a more serious or genuine reason.
3. **hashtag context**: the hashtag ""#myperiod"" provides context that the real reason for being late is menstruation, which is typically not a humorous or light-hearted topic. the juxtaposition of the playful excuse with the genuine reason suggests sarcasm.

not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **tone and sentiment**: the text expresses a genuine sentiment of nostalgia and reflection on childhood. the tone is sincere and contemplative rather than mocking or ironic.

2. **language style**: the informal and conversational language style, including the use of casual expressions and a mix of english and hindi, suggests a genuine and heartfelt expression rather than sarcasm.

3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of apostrophe and personification adds to the nostalgic and reflective tone, indicating a sincere expression of feelings.

4. **emotional words**: words like ""nostalgic"" and ""bachpan"" (childhood) evoke genuine emotions and memories, which are not typically associated with sarcasm.

5. **punctuation**: the use of exclamation marks and casual punctuation supports the informal and genuine tone of the message.

overall, the cues indicate that the text is a straightforward expression of nostalgia and reflection on childhood, without any clear markers of sarcasm.",0.0

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, casual statement about spending time with a dog. the informal language, use of slang, and inclusion of a hashtag and image link are typical of sincere social media posts. there's no apparent irony, contradiction, or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems genuinely relaxed and positive, consistent with someone casually sharing a moment with their pet.","### current cues:
the text uses humor and irony as rhetorical devices. the humor comes from the setup of a classic joke format (""walk into a bar""), and the irony is in both mike smith and brian hoyer simultaneously claiming, ""i told you it wasn't all my fault,"" suggesting a shared sense of blame or denial. the hashtags #coyotes and #browns indicate the context, likely referring to sports teams and their associated struggles.

while there is some uncertainty without more context, the cues provided are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic tone in this statement. the contrast between wanting to ""look super cute"" and the mundane situation of repair workers visiting suggests sarcasm, especially given the topic description. however, there's still a degree of ambiguity without more context or tone indicators, which is why i'm not 100% certain but am confident enough to say ""yes"" within the allowed 40% uncertainty margin.

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### response:

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the message ""@mtnza so apparently twitter is free... so why is my data being depleted using twitter? #not impressed"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""apparently"" and the ellipsis suggests doubt or disbelief about the claim that twitter is free. the question ""so why is my data being depleted using twitter?"" implies that the user's experience contradicts the claim. the hashtag ""#not impressed"" further emphasizes the user's dissatisfaction and sarcastic tone.",1.0

while the provided cues offer some context, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcastic polarity in this text. the ellipsis and hashtags could be used in either sincere or sarcastic statements. without additional context or more specific indicators of tone, it's difficult to determine whether the statement is meant sincerely or sarcastically. the brevity and informality of the text also make it challenging to ascertain the intended tone with certainty.

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text is a straightforward expression of a desire to return to college.
2. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the use of hashtags (#feeling #this) appears to be genuine emphasis rather than mocking or sarcastic.
4. the ellipsis (..) at the end suggests a trailing thought or contemplation, which is consistent with a sincere expression of wanting to return to college.
5. the informal, brief style is typical of sincere social media posts rather than sarcastic commentary.

the text seems to be a genuine expression of the author's feelings about returning to college, without any discernible sarcastic intent.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **emotional contrasts**: the text presents a clear contrast in emotions towards different types of social media interactions. the user expresses approval of auto-messagers but disapproval of follow-backers. this contrast can often be a sign of sarcasm, especially when the positive sentiment is linked to a financial benefit.
   
2. **context**: the context of the tweet, where the user is responding to someone on twitter, can imply a sarcastic tone, especially if the original tweet was critical or questioning the use of auto-messagers.

3. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, along with the use of abbreviations and hashtags, is typical of sarcastic comments on social media.

4. **punctuation**: the use of ellipsis (""..."") can indicate a trailing thought or a pause for effect, which is often used in sarcastic statements to imply something left unsaid or to add a mocking tone.

5. **keywords**: the phrase ""they make me money over on tsu"" can be interpreted sarcastically, as it might be seen as a justification for a practice that is generally frowned upon (auto-messagers).

6. **common knowledge**: it is commonly known that auto-messagers and follow-backers are often viewed negatively in social media communities. the user's approval of auto-messagers because they make money can be seen as a sarcastic justification.

given these points, the text appears to have a sarcastic tone, especially in the context of social media interactions.",1.0

while the provided cues offer some insight into the emotional contrast in the text, they are not sufficient to conclusively detect sarcastic polarity. the text could be genuinely expressing skepticism or employing sarcasm, but the current cues don't provide enough context or specific markers of sarcasm to make a definitive determination. additional information about the context, tone, or typical communication style of the speaker would be needed for a more accurate assessment of sarcastic intent.

label: sarcastic

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text ""taking a hour to shit is always a good thing. #not"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of the hashtag ""#not"" directly contradicts the positive statement made earlier, indicating that the speaker does not actually believe that taking an hour to defecate is a good thing. this is a common way to express sarcasm, where the speaker says something positive but then negates it with a hashtag or a similar marker.

:unamused_face: half of the testing group was very helpful today.

steps:
yes

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

:unamused_face: half of the testing group was very helpful today.

steps:
yes

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

label:
based on the provided context and the use of the :unamused_face: emoji, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

label: sarcastic

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

sarcastic

the use of the hashtag #irony at the end of the statement indicates that the speaker finds the situation ironic. the fact that the kid who previously attempted to steal tools is now upset about someone taking his hot sauce is presented in a way that highlights the contradiction and absurdity of the situation. this contrast between the kid's past behavior and his current complaint is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely mocking the kid's sense of injustice, given his own history of attempting to steal.",1.0

not sarcastic

this tweet appears to be a straightforward promotional message about a smartphone app that can help raise money for a church. the use of capitalization, abbreviations, and multiple links is typical of social media marketing, especially on platforms like twitter with character limits. the exclamation point and emphasis on ""app pays you!"" convey enthusiasm rather than sarcasm. the direct addressing of specific users (@revarun @c_of_e) and the provision of multiple informational links also suggest this is a genuine attempt to share information about the app, not a sarcastic comment. therefore, based on the content and style of the message, i would classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### current cues:

reasoning:
1. the tone of the message is sincere and positive. the author expresses genuine interest in the other person's reading achievement and shows determination to improve their own.

2. the use of words like ""interesting"" and ""surely"" indicate a positive and earnest attitude.

3. there's no apparent irony or contradiction in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.

4. the author is openly admitting to reading fewer books (17) and expressing a desire to improve, which is a straightforward and honest sentiment.

5. the use of the hashtag #2015 suggests a genuine intention to set a goal for the coming year.

6. the informal language and twitter-style writing are consistent with a casual, friendly exchange rather than a sarcastic comment.

therefore, this tweet appears to be a genuine response expressing admiration, self-reflection, and determination, without any indicators of sarcasm.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **tone and language style**: the tone of the message is provocative and critical, which is often a marker of sarcasm. the use of ellipses (""..."") suggests a pause for effect, which can indicate a sarcastic or ironic statement.

2. **contradiction and irony**: the statement ""equal justice for all...unless you are black during the obama administration"" contains a clear contradiction. it starts with a universally accepted principle (""equal justice for all"") and then immediately undermines it with a specific exception, which is a common structure in sarcastic remarks.

3. **context and source**: the inclusion of a hyperlink to a fox news politics article and the mention of a social media handle (@foxnewspolitics) suggest that the statement is intended to provoke a reaction and engage in political commentary, which often employs sarcasm to make a point.

4. **emotional contrast**: the phrase ""equal justice for all"" is typically positive and idealistic, but the follow-up clause introduces a negative and critical perspective, creating an emotional contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm.

5. **purpose and audience**: the message is crafted for a digital audience, likely aiming to provoke thought or debate. the provocative nature and the context of political critique further support the interpretation of sarcasm.

based on these cues, the text appears to be using sarcasm to criticize the perceived lack of equal justice for black individuals during the obama administration.",1.0

my confidence in this judgment is about 70%. the given cues provide some context about the text being a headline or title for an article, but they don't offer enough specific information about sarcastic elements or tone to conclusively determine sarcastic polarity. without more details about the content or style of the full article, it's difficult to assess whether sarcasm is present or not.

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","sarcastic

the statement ""i love it when people try to tell me that oakland is so much easier than other schools 😡 #not"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of the word ""love"" in this context, combined with the angry emoji and the hashtag ""#not,"" indicates that the speaker is expressing frustration and disagreement, not genuine affection. the sarcasm is evident in the contrast between the positive word ""love"" and the negative sentiment conveyed by the rest of the statement.",1.0

the text seems to be a genuine expression of the author's feelings about returning to college, without any discernible sarcastic intent.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **emphasis**: the capitalization of ""that"" and the exclamation mark suggest a heightened emotional reaction, which can often be associated with sarcasm when expressing disbelief or mock surprise.
2. **context**: the text is directed at a user (@robinhosking) and expresses surprise or confusion, which can be genuine but is often sarcastic in informal social media interactions.
3. **language style**: the informal and conversational style, combined with the use of capitalization and punctuation, is typical of sarcastic remarks meant to mock or question something unexpected.
4. **emotional words**: the emphasis on ""that"" conveys a strong reaction, which in the context of social media, is frequently used sarcastically to highlight something perceived as obvious or absurd.
5. **common knowledge**: in social media, expressions of surprise or confusion directed at someone are often sarcastic, especially when exaggerated with punctuation and capitalization.

given these points, the text ""@robinhosking where did that come from?!"" is likely sarcastic, expressing mock surprise or disbelief.",1.0

2. **emotional contrast**: the use of the word ""#unimpressed"" contrasts sharply with the extreme and vivid description of discomfort, suggesting that the speaker is downplaying their actual frustration or discomfort in a sarcastic manner.

3. **language style**: the informal and exaggerated language style is typical of sarcastic comments, where the speaker uses over-the-top descriptions to convey their true feelings indirectly.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text describes a situation where the person gets on a work bus and the driver plays the song ""another day in paradise,"" which the person finds ironic. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" suggests that the person is highlighting the contrast between the song's title and the reality of their situation, implying that their day is far from being a ""paradise.""

the text ""it's all about twitter #not a clue"" uses irony to convey sarcasm. the initial statement suggests that twitter is very important, but the hashtag ""#not a clue"" contradicts this by indicating the speaker's lack of understanding or knowledge about twitter. this contrast creates a sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker does not actually believe twitter is important or central.",1.0

reasoning:
1. the text is a straightforward expression of a desire to return to college.
2. there are no indicators of irony, exaggeration, or contradiction that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the use of hashtags (#feeling #this) appears to be genuine emphasis rather than mocking or sarcastic.
4. the ellipsis (..) at the end suggests a trailing thought or contemplation, which is consistent with a sincere expression of wanting to return to college.

the text seems to be a genuine expression of the author's feelings about returning to college, without any discernible sarcastic intent.","### response:

### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **contrast in emotion**: the text shows a clear contrast between suspicion and dismissal. the speaker initially expresses a negative emotion by suspecting the other person doesn't care about the truth.
2. **dismissive language**: the use of ""whatever"" indicates a dismissive attitude, which can often be a marker of sarcasm.
3. **playful tone**: the phrase ""go troll someone else ;-)"" adds a playful, mocking tone, which is a strong indicator of sarcasm.
4. **winking emoticon**: the winking emoticon ("";-)"") is commonly used to signal that the statement should not be taken at face value and is often associated with sarcasm.

while these linguistic cues provide helpful context, they are not definitively sufficient to determine sarcastic polarity with high confidence. the informal style, hashtag use, and emojis could be consistent with either sincere or sarcastic intent in this case. more contextual information or clearer indicators of irony would be needed to make a confident judgment about sarcasm.
next_cue_response:emotional contrasts
yes

label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the claim of ""going strong"" after 36 hours without food or drink is likely an exaggeration or ironic statement.

2. the contrast between claiming to be ""strong"" while simultaneously begging for a drink (brew) with the hashtag and emojis suggests sarcasm.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

5. the overall structure presents a contradictory message – strength vs. desperation – which is a hallmark of sarcastic expression.

given these factors, the label ""sarcastic"" is the most appropriate choice for this text.","### response:
the text contains the following brief emotional words:
- thanks; the context of the text is a response from someone named kayla battaglia, expressing thanks and clarifying that they thought an event or something was scheduled for tomorrow. the hashtags #not, #iknow, and #notthepoint suggest a mix of acknowledgment and perhaps a bit of frustration or humor about the misunderstanding.

### label:
sarcastic

the text exhibits clear sarcastic elements:

1. the use of hashtags like #not, #iknow, and #notthepoint indicates a playful or ironic tone, suggesting that the speaker is aware of the misunderstanding and is perhaps poking fun at it.

2. the phrase ""thanks i thought it was tomorrow"" combined with the hashtags implies that the speaker is not genuinely thankful but rather expressing a mild frustration or humor about the situation.

3. the overall structure and tone of the message, including the informal language and hashtags, are consistent with sarcastic social media posts.

while there is some room for uncertainty, the cues provided offer strong indications of sarcasm:

1. the context of addressing a customer service team
2. the phrase ""continuing with"" implying an ongoing issue
3. the use of ""wonderful"" in a context that suggests the opposite

the message ""@asdaserviceteam continuing with that wonderful customer service ?"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""wonderful"" in this context is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a sarcastic remark implying that the customer service has actually been poor or unsatisfactory. the question mark at the end further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, suggesting disbelief or frustration with the ongoing subpar service.","### response:

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues alone are not fully sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this case. the extracted terms are factual references to the miss world pageant and its common theme of ""world peace."" without additional context or tone indicators, it's difficult to conclusively determine if sarcasm is intended based solely on these cues. the question format and hashtag could potentially hint at sarcasm, but more linguistic or contextual information would be needed for a confident assessment.
next_cue_response:context
yes

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

3. **punctuation and emoticons**: the smiley face emoticon "":)"" at the end of the tweet can be a subtle indicator of sarcasm, as it often accompanies sarcastic remarks to soften the tone or indicate that the statement is not to be taken literally.

4. **language style**: the informal and casual language style, combined with the context of a social media post, supports the interpretation of sarcasm. the user is likely expressing frustration or disappointment in a humorous or ironic way.

the text exhibits clear signs of sarcasm. the speaker is expressing confusion and disappointment about finding evidence of a stripper in their house but not actually seeing a stripper there. the use of the emoji 😑 (indicating frustration or annoyance) and 💔 (indicating heartbreak) further suggests that the speaker is not genuinely upset about the absence of a stripper but is instead making a sarcastic comment about the situation. the contrast between the expectation (evidence of a stripper) and the reality (no stripper present) is a common indicator of sarcasm.",1.0

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" is a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance with the social media platform.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or unexpected twist that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the sentiment aligns with common opinions about social media platforms sometimes being frustrating.
4. the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of hidden meaning or contradiction that are typical of sarcastic statements.
5. the use of ""so"" as an intensifier emphasizes the genuine feeling of annoyance rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of irritation with twitter, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **positive emotional tone**: the text ""beach hangs with my bffz"" suggests a positive and relaxed emotional tone, indicating enjoyment and camaraderie.
2. **context**: the text indicates that the person is spending time at the beach with their best friends, which is typically a positive and enjoyable activity.
3. **language style**: the language style is informal and casual, using internet slang (""bffz"" for ""best friends forever"") and a url link, suggesting a social media or text message context. the use of abbreviations and casual phrasing indicates a relaxed, conversational tone.
4. **emotional words**: the word ""bffz"" implies a positive and affectionate feeling towards friends.
5. **topic**: the topic of the text is about spending time at the beach with close friends, which is generally a positive experience.
6. **punctuation**: the punctuation used is typical for a url link and does not indicate any sarcastic tone.

given these points, the statement appears to be a sincere expression of enjoyment and camaraderie, not a sarcastic comment.",0.0

while there is some room for uncertainty, the cues provided offer strong indications of sarcasm:

1. the context of addressing a customer service team
2. the phrase ""continuing with"" implying an ongoing issue
3. the use of ""wonderful"" in a context that suggests the opposite
4. the question mark at the end, which often denotes sarcasm when paired with a seemingly positive statement

these elements combined give a high likelihood of sarcastic intent, even if there's a small margin of uncertainty.

based on the provided context and the content of the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the message ""@asdaserviceteam continuing with that wonderful customer service ?"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of ""wonderful"" in this context is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a sarcastic remark implying that the customer service has actually been poor or unsatisfactory. the question mark at the end further emphasizes the sarcastic tone, suggesting disbelief or frustration with the ongoing subpar service.","### response:

steps:
yes

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

label:

label: sarcastic

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### response:

based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" is a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance with the social media platform.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or unexpected twist that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the sentiment aligns with common opinions about social media platforms sometimes being frustrating.
4. the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of hidden meaning or contradiction that are typical of sarcastic statements.
5. the use of ""so"" as an intensifier emphasizes the genuine feeling of annoyance rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of irritation with twitter, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **content and context**: the text discusses the nature of friendships and the necessity of natural affinity for them to progress. it contrasts this with the ability to exert influence or change in other matters.
2. **language style**: the language is informal and conversational, using contractions and a casual tone. this style does not inherently suggest sarcasm.
3. **rhetorical devices**: the use of contrast and assertion in the text serves to make a point about the nature of friendships rather than to convey sarcasm.
4. **keywords and emotional words**: the keywords and emotional words used (e.g., ""influence,"" ""change,"" ""friendships,"" ""affinity"") are straightforward and do not indicate sarcasm.
5. **punctuation**: the punctuation used is standard and does not suggest a sarcastic tone.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:

my reasoning is that while the provided cues offer some useful context about the text's structure and topic, they do not provide sufficient information to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the cues mainly describe the format and content of what appears to be a tweet sharing an article headline, but don't give insight into potential sarcastic intent or tone. without more information about the article's content or the poster's typical communication style, it's not possible to make a confident determination about sarcasm based solely on these cues.

while there is some uncertainty without seeing the full context or tone of the original message, the provided cues offer sufficient information to reasonably detect sarcasm in this text. the combination of the skeptical framing (""maybe... will succeed where all her predecessors have failed""), the reference to the cliché beauty pageant answer of ""world peace,"" and the context of it being a social media post about a beauty pageant strongly suggest a sarcastic tone. the phrasing implies doubt about the effectiveness of beauty pageant winners in achieving world peace, which is a common target for sarcastic commentary.

label:
label: sarcastic

this text is clearly sarcastic. the author is using irony to mock the common trope of beauty pageant contestants expressing a desire for world peace. 

the phrasing ""maybe miss world will succeed where all her predecessors have failed"" implies a strong skepticism about the likelihood of this actually happening. the use of a question mark further emphasizes the doubt and sarcastic tone.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""i have three exams today lets gooooo! #school #sarcasm #swag"" clearly exhibits sarcasm. the enthusiastic tone (""lets gooooo!"") juxtaposed with the stressful situation of having three exams in one day, along with the explicit hashtag ""#sarcasm,"" strongly indicates that the author is not genuinely excited but rather expressing their frustration or dread in a sarcastic manner.

3. the use of emojis, especially the loudly crying face, contradicts the assertion of ""going strong,"" further indicating a sarcastic tone.

4. the informal language and hashtag usage are common in sarcastic social media posts.

this tweet appears to be a straightforward, casual statement about spending time with a dog. the informal language, use of slang, and inclusion of a hashtag and image link are typical of sincere social media posts. there's no apparent irony, contradiction, or exaggeration that would suggest sarcasm. the tone seems genuinely relaxed and positive, consistent with someone casually sharing a moment with their pet.","### current cues:
the language style in the given text is informal and conversational, featuring casual expressions (""lol""), playful tone, and a mix of colloquial phrases (""old enough to know better... young enough to do it again""). the use of ellipses adds a relaxed, almost teasing rhythm to the statement.;the context of the given text is a light-hearted and playful exchange on social media, specifically twitter, involving two users, @stephhammy and @zacaparum. the message humorously reflects on the idea of being at an age where one is wise enough to understand the consequences of their actions but still youthful enough to repeat them.

### input:
@stephhammy @zacaparum lol.. old enough to know better... young enough to do it again

### response:
the text uses humor and a playful tone to convey a message about the balance between wisdom and youthful impulsiveness. the use of ""lol"" and ellipses suggests a light-hearted, joking manner. the phrase ""old enough to know better... young enough to do it again"" is a common humorous expression that can be interpreted as self-deprecating or ironic.

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text ""@coreybking thanks for the spoiler!!!! #not"" is indeed sarcastic. the use of ""thanks"" followed by multiple exclamation marks and the hashtag ""#not"" clearly indicates that the thanks is not genuine and is instead expressing frustration or annoyance about the spoiler being revealed.

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

### reasoning:
1. **sentiment**: the text expresses a genuine sentiment of nostalgia and longing for disney world, indicated by the hashtags #missit and #myhappyplace.
2. **punctuation**: the use of hashtags reinforces the sincerity of the emotions being expressed.
3. **rhetorical devices**: the hyperbole in ""i think about disney world just about every day"" emphasizes the strong feelings and longing for disney world, rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.
4. **language style**: the informal and personal language style, along with the use of hashtags, suggests a sincere expression of feelings.
5. **topic**: the topic is about missing disney world and considering it a happy place, which aligns with the genuine sentiment expressed in the text.

therefore, the statement appears to be a sincere expression of longing and happiness associated with disney world, not a sarcastic comment.",0.0

while these cues provide useful context, they are not sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this text. the statement could be genuinely sincere appreciation, or it could potentially be sarcastic, depending on the broader context and tone that isn't fully captured in these brief cues. without additional indicators of tone or contradictory information, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether sarcasm is present or not.

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the hashtag ""#not insured"" is often used in social media to highlight a situation ironically or sarcastically, especially when discussing issues related to insurance coverage.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the phrase implies a significant concern or problem (lack of insurance) but is presented in a very casual, almost dismissive manner, which can be a hallmark of sarcasm.
3. **language style**: the use of a hashtag to convey a serious issue in a brief and informal way can suggest a sarcastic tone, as it contrasts the gravity of the situation with the lightness of the presentation.
4. **common knowledge**: it is commonly understood that being uninsured is a serious issue, and presenting it in such a nonchalant manner can be interpreted as sarcastic.

given these points, the text ""#not insured"" is likely intended to be sarcastic, highlighting the disparity between the seriousness of being uninsured and the casual way it is presented.",1.0

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the current cues ""lovely"" and ""not"" suggest a contrast that is often used in sarcastic statements. the use of ""lovely"" in a context where it is unlikely to be genuinely positive (having 13 voice mails at work) followed by ""#not"" clearly indicates sarcasm.

no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question about obamacare's impact on health care spending, shared as a tweet with a link to a forbes article. without more context or content from the actual article, it's not possible to determine if there's any sarcastic intent behind the question.
next_cue_response:keywords
no
next_cue_response:punctuation
no

my reasoning is that while the provided cues offer some useful context about the text's structure and topic, they do not provide sufficient information to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the cues mainly describe the format and content of what appears to be a tweet sharing an article headline, but don't give insight into potential sarcastic intent or tone. without more information about the article's content or the poster's typical communication style, it's not possible to make a confident determination about sarcasm based solely on these cues.
next_cue_response:common knowledge
no. the provided cues are not sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the given text. the text appears to be a straightforward question and a link to an article, without any clear indicators of sarcasm. the available information focuses on analyzing the structure, style, and content of the text, but does not provide specific cues that would help determine if the text is meant to be sarcastic or sincere.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward headline or title of an article, followed by a link to forbes.
2. it's phrased as a neutral question about a serious topic (healthcare spending).
3. there are no obvious indicators of sarcasm, such as exaggeration, irony, or mocking tone.
4. the source (forbes) is a reputable business magazine, typically associated with factual reporting rather than sarcastic commentary.
5. the language is concise and direct, which is common for social media shares of news articles.

the text seems to be a genuine inquiry into the effects of obamacare on healthcare spending, likely leading to an informative article on the topic. therefore, it's most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **context**: the text refers to eating cheese, specifically stilton, in a manner reminiscent of the festive and indulgent nature of christmas.
2. **emotional contrasts**: the text conveys a sense of indulgence and joy, with no apparent negative or contrasting emotions.
3. **emotional words**: the words ""christmas"" and ""overload"" suggest a positive and humorous tone.
4. **language style**: the informal and playful language, along with the hashtag, indicates a lighthearted tone rather than sarcasm.
5. **keywords**: words like ""munching,"" ""cheese,"" ""christmas,"" and ""#stiltonoverload"" are associated with enjoyment and indulgence.
6. **punctuation**: the use of a hashtag adds emphasis and humor but does not indicate sarcasm.

the text appears to be a genuine expression of enjoyment and indulgence in eating cheese, similar to the festive spirit of christmas. therefore, it is most appropriate to classify this as ""not sarcastic.""",0.0

this comment is indeed sarcastic. the user is playfully mocking common conspiracy theories about space photos or moon landing images by exaggeratedly questioning the authenticity of the historical picture based on the absence of stars.

the use of double exclamation marks (""!!"") and double question marks (""??"") adds to the dramatic, over-the-top tone, which is characteristic of sarcasm. the commenter is likely aware that the absence of stars in such photos is normal and explainable, but is humorously pretending to be skeptical to poke fun at those who genuinely make such arguments.

the contrast between the initial interest implied by engaging with a historical picture account and the sudden, exaggerated skepticism further reinforces the sarcastic nature of the comment.","### response:
the text is indeed sarcastic. the user is mocking the avoidance of the term ""christmas"" in favor of more generic terms like ""holiday"" when referring to christmas decorations. the hashtags #sarcasm and #itisachristmastree further emphasize the sarcastic tone, indicating that the user believes it should be called a ""christmas tree"" rather than just a holiday decoration.

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty without more context, the cues provided are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic tone in this statement. the contrast between wanting to ""look super cute"" and the mundane situation of repair workers visiting suggests sarcasm, especially given the topic description. however, there's still a degree of ambiguity without more context or tone indicators, which is why i'm not 100% certain but am confident enough to say ""yes"" within the allowed 40% uncertainty margin.

the statement ""i always look super cute when guys come to fix stuff in the condo"" is likely meant sarcastically. people typically don't make an effort to look their best when repair workers visit, and the exaggerated claim of ""always"" looking ""super cute"" in this mundane situation suggests the speaker is being ironic. they are likely implying the opposite - that they tend to look disheveled or unprepared when repair workers unexpectedly show up at their home.","### response:

the hashtag #missworld2014 contextualizes the comment as being about a specific pageant, likely made in real-time as the event was occurring, which adds to the immediacy and pointed nature of the sarcasm.

the sarcasm here is critiquing the superficiality of beauty pageants claiming to address serious global issues like world peace, when in reality they have little impact on such matters. it's a common target for satirical commentary, and this tweet fits squarely into that tradition.","### response:

the text ""@joshuasinghaiw that bump off the apron looked like it hurt.. was that padding u landed on? #sarcasm"" is clearly sarcastic. the use of the hashtag #sarcasm explicitly indicates the sarcastic tone. additionally, the rhetorical question ""was that padding u landed on?"" implies that the landing was not soft or cushioned, further emphasizing the sarcastic nature of the comment.

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe these cues are likely insufficient to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the content appears to be a twitter-style message with usernames and a reference to character limits, but there's not enough contextual information or clear indicators of tone to confidently determine sarcasm. more context or the full content of the message would be needed for a more accurate assessment.

based on the available cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward social media post, likely from twitter, given the mention of ""140 limits"" and multiple twitter handles.
2. there's no evident contrast between literal and intended meaning, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
3. the language used is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or mockery.
4. the word ""dummy"" could be seen as mildly insulting, but its use here doesn't seem to indicate sarcasm.
5. the overall structure and content of the message appear to be informational rather than sarcastic.

while the context is limited, the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit fragmented, communication on a social media platform.","### label:
sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **colloquialism and humor**: the use of ""barnet"" (british slang for hair) and the playful tone suggest a humorous intent.
2. **contextual clues**: the mention of a ""header"" (likely in a sports context, such as heading a soccer ball) and its potential impact on someone's hair adds a layer of irony.
3. **informal and conversational style**: the informal language and conversational style are often used in sarcastic remarks.
4. **playful concern**: the text expresses a playful concern that a header might have messed up someone's hair, which is an exaggerated and humorous scenario, indicating sarcasm.

the combination of these elements points towards a sarcastic tone in the message.",1.0

while i'm fairly confident this text is likely sincere rather than sarcastic, i don't believe the given cues alone provide enough context to definitively determine sarcastic polarity with less than 40% uncertainty. the brief description of the topic and content align with the text, but sarcasm can sometimes mimic sincere praise. without additional contextual cues about tone, setting, or the speaker's typical communication style, i can't rule out potential sarcasm with the required level of certainty.

while there is some room for uncertainty, the combination of the unamused face emoji and the statement about only half the group being helpful provides sufficient context to detect sarcastic intent. the emoji sets a negative tone that contrasts with the seemingly positive statement, which is a common sarcastic structure.

label:
based on the provided context and the use of the :unamused_face: emoji, i believe i can confidently assign a label to this text.

the use of the unamused face emoji at the beginning of the statement sets a negative tone, which contrasts with the seemingly positive statement about half the group being helpful. this contrast is a classic indicator of sarcasm. the speaker is likely implying dissatisfaction with the fact that only half the group was helpful, rather than genuinely praising that half. the sarcasm lies in presenting a partially positive situation (half being helpful) in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect (the other half not being helpful).","### current cues:

while there is some uncertainty, i don't believe these cues alone are sufficient to definitively detect sarcasm in this short statement. the text expresses a straightforward negative sentiment about twitter without clear markers of sarcasm like exaggeration, contrast, or irony. more context or tone indicators would be needed to confidently identify sarcastic intent.

my response is ""no"" because the given cues do not provide sufficient information to confidently detect sarcastic polarity in the text ""twitter can be so annoying."" the statement could be a genuine expression of frustration or a sarcastic comment, and the current cues don't offer enough context or clear indicators of sarcasm to make a definitive judgment.

label:
based on the provided cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

not sarcastic

reasoning:
1. the statement ""twitter can be so annoying"" is a straightforward expression of frustration or annoyance with the social media platform.
2. there's no apparent irony, exaggeration, or unexpected twist that would suggest sarcasm.
3. the sentiment aligns with common opinions about social media platforms sometimes being frustrating.
4. the language is direct and doesn't contain any indicators of hidden meaning or contradiction that are typical of sarcastic statements.
5. the use of ""so"" as an intensifier emphasizes the genuine feeling of annoyance rather than introducing a sarcastic tone.

therefore, this statement appears to be a sincere expression of irritation with twitter, not a sarcastic comment.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **rhetorical devices**: the text uses repetition (""let. it. go."") and metaphor (""drag yesterday into today"") to emphasize its message, which is typical of motivational or inspirational language rather than sarcasm.
2. **context**: the text encourages letting go of past events to allow for a better future, which aligns with a sincere, motivational tone.
3. **keywords**: phrases like ""let. it. go."" and ""#bringon2015"" suggest a genuine focus on moving forward and welcoming the new year.
4. **emotional contrasts**: the text contrasts the negative emotion of holding onto the past with the positive emotion of embracing the future, which supports a sincere, motivational intent.
5. **language style**: the language is motivational and concise, using short, impactful sentences to convey a positive attitude.
6. **punctuation**: the use of periods for emphasis and a hashtag for a forward-looking message further supports a sincere tone.

given these points, the text appears to be a genuine expression of encouragement and motivation, not a sarcastic comment.",0.0

while i'm not entirely certain, i believe these cues are likely insufficient to reliably detect sarcastic polarity. the content appears to be a twitter-style message with usernames and a reference to character limits, but there's not enough contextual information or clear indicators of tone to confidently determine sarcasm. more context or the full content of the message would be needed for a more accurate assessment.

based on the available cues and the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

reasoning:
1. the text appears to be a straightforward social media post, likely from twitter, given the mention of ""140 limits"" and multiple twitter handles.
2. there's no evident contrast between literal and intended meaning, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.
3. the language used is casual and direct, without any apparent irony or mockery.
4. the word ""dummy"" could be seen as mildly insulting, but its use here doesn't seem to indicate sarcasm.
5. the overall structure and content of the message appear to be informational rather than sarcastic.

while the context is limited, the text doesn't display typical markers of sarcasm such as exaggeration, irony, or incongruity between the literal statement and the intended meaning. it seems to be a straightforward, albeit fragmented, communication on a social media platform.","### label:
not sarcastic

### reasoning:
1. **congratulatory tone**: the text starts with ""congrats,"" which sets a positive and sincere tone.
2. **excitement and anticipation**: the author expresses excitement about the upcoming game, using phrases like ""is gonna be one great game!!"" which indicates genuine enthusiasm.
3. **informal and friendly language**: the use of informal language and abbreviations like ""fav"" and ""gonna"" suggests a casual and friendly tone rather than a sarcastic one.
4. **rhetorical devices**: while the text uses rhetorical devices such as apostrophe and hyperbole, they are employed to emphasize excitement and pride rather than to convey sarcasm.
5. **punctuation**: the use of exclamation marks and a question mark further supports the enthusiastic and playful nature of the message.

overall, the text appears to be a genuine expression of congratulations and excitement, with no clear indicators of sarcasm.",0.0

steps:
yes

while there is some uncertainty, i believe these cues are likely sufficient to detect the sarcastic polarity of the text. the contrasting concepts of ""divide"" and ""unite"" paired with the exclamation ""what an irony!"" strongly suggest sarcasm. the hashtags further reinforce the controversial topics being addressed sarcastically. this combination of elements provides a reasonably clear indication of sarcastic intent, even if not 100% certain.

label:
given the cues provided and analyzing the input text, i can confidently assign the label:

sarcastic

the statement uses irony explicitly and juxtaposes contrasting concepts (divide vs. unite) in an unexpected way, which are hallmarks of sarcasm. the exclamation marks and the use of hashtags further emphasize the sardonic tone of the message. the speaker is using sarcasm to critique a perceived societal contradiction, making this a clear example of sarcastic expression.","### response:

the input text contains several cues that suggest a sarcastic tone. the use of the hashtag ""#irony"" explicitly indicates that the statement is meant to be ironic. additionally, the phrase ""because feminism, or something"" is dismissive and vague, which often signals sarcasm. the mention of al jazeera being ""pro anti-gamergate"" adds to the complexity and controversial nature of the statement, further suggesting a sarcastic intent.
